"So understand the Light," He answered, "and make friends with it." — HERMES THE THRICE-GREATEST

## Prolegomena

Time is once again pregnant with the birth of its twentieth child, as counted by the Western world. According to records, nineteen of her centenarian offspring have lived and died since the arrival of the one whom all Christians regard as the Teacher of the Way to God. The shared belief of the General Church is not just that He is the Teacher, but that He is the Way itself. This belief unites Christians worldwide and has been the symbol of their union for centuries. Approximately nineteen hundred years ago, the Illuminator appeared and brought light into the world—this is the core belief of the followers of the great Western religion.

Just as honorific inscriptions once celebrated the birthday of Roman Emperor Augustus, Christians now celebrate the birth of Jesus in similar terms:

> This day has given the earth an entirely new aspect. The world would have gone to destruction had there not streamed forth from him who is now born a common blessing.
>
> Rightly does he judge who recognises in this birthday the beginning of life and of all the powers of life; now is that time ended when men pitied themselves for being born.
>
> From no other day does the individual or the community receive such benefit as from this day of birth, full of blessing to all.
>
> The Providence which rules over all has filled this man with such gifts for the salvation of the world as designate him as Savior for us and for the coming generations; he will make an end of wars and establish all things worthily.
>
> The hopes of our forefathers are fulfilled by his appearance; not only has he surpassed the good deeds of an earlier time, but it is impossible that one greater than he can ever appear.
>
> The birthday of God has brought to the world glad tidings that are bound up in him.
>
> From his birthday a new era begins.

This is the most significant of several inscriptions recently found in Asia Minor, commemorating the introduction of the Julian Calendar by Emperor Augustus, dated to 9 B.C. (See Harnack's article in Die christliche Welt, Dec. 1899). However, the hopes of the Emperor-cult followers were soon dashed; the expectations of Christendom remain largely unfulfilled. The past nineteen centuries have been marked by bitter strife, bloody wars, persecution, and religious intolerance unmatched in history.

Will the twentieth century see the fulfillment of this great expectation? Can we say that "all of nature is eagerly awaiting the revelation of the Sons of God"? Can anyone observing the current signs of the times doubt that, at the dawn of the twentieth century, there is a quickening and expanding of religious thought and feeling among Christian nations, as if in the throes of a new birth? If this is the case, why shouldn't the twentieth century witness the realization of this long-deferred hope by those born into it?

Never in the Western world has the general public been more ready to understand religious matters than it is today. Conditions have never been better for people to gain a wise view of the true nature of Christ and His mission in the evolution of world faith. Our task now is to highlight certain points that may help restore the grand figure of the Great Teacher to its rightful place in history and tradition, and to show the connections between the true ideal of Christianity and the universal faith shared by the most advanced souls in humanity. In short, we aim to restore Christ's teachings to their true spirit of universality.

We do not intend to diminish anyone's reverence and love for the Great Soul who watches over Christendom. Instead, we aim to identify a foundation where that love can grow even more abundantly and confidently embrace the rational aspects of the Spiritual Sun. This foundation is rich enough to support the full growth of human beings, nurturing every part of our nature—emotional, moral, rational, and spiritual. Like many others, we believe there is only one religion for humanity, with various faiths and creeds being streams of this great river. Though this may seem difficult for some to accept, let us briefly consider its meaning.

The Sun of Truth is one. Its rays reach into the minds and hearts of all people. If we believe in anything at all, we must believe in the Fatherhood of God! Must we not then believe that our common Father loves all His children equally, at all times and in all places? We should have learned this lesson after nineteen hundred years of Christ's teachings. How many truly believe it? The entire history of the Churches of Christendom shows disbelief in this fundamental principle of universal religion.

The greatest enemy has been the evil influence of Jewish exclusivity, which has driven intolerance and persecution. This same spirit has also affected Islam, visible in its violent history. It may be that this narrow-mindedness in religion is necessary for the development of certain souls and is ultimately used for good by the Wisdom that guides the world.

But isn't a greater share of our Father's blessing possible now? Can't we see that it doesn't matter if a person learns the Path from Krishna, Buddha, Mohammed, Zoroaster, or Christ? As long as they follow the Path, it is all the same to our common Father. He sent them all and enlightened them so that everyone could receive the spiritual nourishment they need.

Words cannot fully describe the magnificence of this idea or the profound insight into God's providence it offers. Truly understanding this—not just half-heartedly believing it while contradicting it with other beliefs—shows great growth of the heart. We ask our readers to approach the various forms of early Christian faiths with this most blessed doctrine in mind. In this light, "heresy" and "false religion" often appear quite beautiful compared to the "orthodoxy" and "true religion" of their unsympathetic critics.

Let us avoid exaggeration and strive for accurate understanding, for this is the only way to recognize the eternal guidance of God, who, through His Messengers, balances everything in His own time. Professor Max Muller suggested that we should speak of the comparative science of theology rather than the comparative science of religion. This is true for the work done so far by scholars, who have focused mainly on identifying differences and analyzing details. There has been little effort to combine these insights.

However, we are not ready to abandon the term comparative science of religion because we believe such a science exists—perhaps the noblest undertaking for anyone. But it is very challenging. It requires deep knowledge of human nature, history, and a strong empathy for the hopes and fears of religious people, along with unwavering faith in God's guidance in all human affairs.

Imagine if someone could love and respect all the great Teachers in history as deeply as each follower loves their own Master; if they could truly believe in the truth of all great religions as fully, without exclusivity, as each believer trusts in their own faith; if they could see the Divine Wisdom at work in all these expressions—what a magnificent Religion would be theirs! How vast and strong their Faith would be, supported by the teachings of all the world's scriptures and teachers!

Believing in the idea of rebirth, he would see himself as a true global citizen and the rightful heir to all the wisdom in sacred texts. He wouldn't be bothered by accusations of being "eclectic" or "syncretist" from those focused on external differences, because he would be immersed in the essence of Religion. He would ignore those who criticize him as a "heretic" from the sidelines.

This doesn't mean he would dismiss analysis or orthodoxy; rather, his analysis would be both internal and external, and his orthodoxy would be found in the essence of the religion, not in its external forms. The One Religion lives in people's hearts, and its light shines into human nature. Analyzing a religion, therefore, is akin to analyzing humanity.

Every major religion is expressed in many ways, reflecting the diverse minds and hearts of its followers. The profound wisdom of a great sage will naturally differ from the limited understanding of the ignorant and immoral. While the light and life of religion are available to all, not everyone can reflect it equally due to different levels of spiritual development. It's foolish to compare the enlightened views of one group with the superstitious beliefs of another. Yet, many people enjoy doing this to feel that their own faith is superior. This approach won't lead us to truly understand Religion or our fellow humans.

Analyze any of the major religions, and you will find the same elements at work: the same issues of human imperfection to study, many who are "called," and few who are "chosen." Each religion, as always, has "many Thyrsus-bearers but few Bacchi." Comparing the Bacchi of one religion with the Thyrsus-bearers of another is pointless.

For example, not all Hindus are unthinking idol worshipers, and not all Christians are fervent followers of Christ. If we compare the two, we should compare the image worship in the Roman Church or Greek Church with the worship of Brahma and other figures in the Hindu pantheon. However, to find a true parallel to the devout life and best theology of Christianity, we must look at the best theology and holiest individuals among the Brahmans.

When we analyze a religion, we find that the least educated people know little about it and hold on to many misconceptions and superstitions. From this distorted view, there are higher levels of understanding and more accurate expressions of the religion, until we reach those who consciously seek to embrace the full light of the religion and make it their life's purpose. It is within this group that we must look to understand the true nature of a religion. Here, we find the genuine connections between different religions and feel the presence of the glorious Spiritual Sun, the source of all Light that shines in the world.

Of all the major religions, none can be more important to a student of comparative religion in the West than Christianity. It confronts them constantly and is a problem they cannot avoid. They are often astonished by the general ignorance about its history and origins. Few people have truly studied the subject, except for a relatively small group of scholars whose job it is to conduct such research. Even among these scholars, few have provided significant insights despite their diligent efforts.

It is challenging for someone who believes in the unity of religion and has a strong faith in the universal nature of Christ's teachings to find much help from the works of either rationalists or apologists. They face countless books filled with conflicting opinions, which are only useful for gathering material for future study. As they delve deeper, they find that many of their initial beliefs about early times need to be significantly revised or even completely discarded. Over time, they reach a point where they can clearly see the remnants of the first two centuries, revealing a world they never learned about in school or heard about from the pulpit.

Is this the world of the early Church they read about in approved manuals and were told about by pastors and teachers? Is this the image of the unified and straightforward community of Jesus' followers, the single doctrine supposedly passed down unchanged since the beginning? Instead, they see a religious world full of activity, a massive upheaval of thought, and intense religious effort unlike anything in Western history. Thousands of schools and communities are striving and competing, characterized by immense freedom of thought and a powerful drive to live a religious life.

In this new environment, he finds numerous connections with other religions and experiences a freedom he never knew within the Christian tradition. Who are all these people—not just fishermen, slaves, and the poor, although they are striving too—but learned men, ascetics, saints, and sages who deserve the title more than many others? Later Church writers call them heretics, dangerous enemies of the True Faith that the Church has now solidified through its decrees and councils. However, the student prefers to study the first two centuries directly rather than rely on the opinions of those who came later and are farther removed from the origins, thus likely knowing less.

Interestingly, despite extensive research on the origins of Christianity through canonical documents, the writings of these "heretics" have received little critical attention. These writings could shed significant light on many obscure issues related to the early history of Christianity. It is only in recent years that their value has been recognized and attempts have been made to consider their perspectives. The Catholic Church, since gaining dominance, has labeled these "heretics" as the "first-born sons of Satan," and the faithful have accepted this without question, believing it to be inspired by the Holy Spirit. However, such simplistic views no longer satisfy the more liberal religious mindset at the beginning of the twentieth century, especially within Protestantism.

For over a hundred years, liberal Christians have worked hard and bravely to save the Bible from being misused by those who lack understanding and have turned it into a mere idol, stripping it of rational thought. This mindset of obscurantism stems from a lack of faith in the ongoing presence of divine inspiration in the Church, implying that inspiration ended when Christianity was still young. Historically, the belief that every part of the Bible is verbally and literally inspired by the Holy Spirit was widely accepted, and most Christians still hold this view today.

Pope Leo XIII's famous encyclical "Providentissimus Deus" (1893) reaffirms the traditional Roman Catholic stance with the following warning:

> It is completely wrong and forbidden to limit inspiration to only certain parts of the Bible or to suggest that the sacred writers made mistakes. The approach of those who, to avoid difficulties, claim that Divine inspiration only concerns faith and morals, and nothing else, is incorrect. They wrongly believe that, in matters of truth or falsehood, we should focus more on the intention behind God's words rather than the words themselves.
>
> This view is unacceptable because all the books the Church considers sacred and canonical are entirely written under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. It is impossible for any error to exist alongside divine inspiration, as inspiration inherently rejects and excludes error, just as it is impossible for God, the ultimate truth, to express anything untrue.
>
> This is the ancient and unchanging belief of the Church, formally defined in the Councils of Florence and Trent, and confirmed and clarified by the Council of the Vatican. The Holy Spirit used men as His instruments, so we cannot say that these inspired writers made mistakes, but not the main author. By supernatural power, He guided them to write. He was present with them, ensuring they understood correctly, then chose to write faithfully, and finally expressed the truth accurately. Otherwise, we could not say He authored all of Scripture. This has always been the belief of the Church Fathers. Therefore, those who claim there's an error in any genuine part of the sacred writings either misunderstand the Catholic idea of inspiration or accuse God of making an error.

This encyclical is not just a historical document from the Middle Ages; it is the most solemn and authoritative statement from the leader of the largest and most powerful Church in Christianity. It binds all the faithful and was widely distributed at the end of the nineteenth century, a time when we believed we were much more advanced than our ancestors. It is clear that such a declaration is necessary from the head of a Church committed to the dogma of infallibility, and whose existence relies on maintaining unquestioned authority.

However, to align this dogma with reason, its scholars often use a method that is very unappealing to those who value scientific research, and this makes the writings of Roman Catholic critics seem insincere. We shouldn't necessarily doubt their sincerity, because in religion, faith often overrides reason. As students of life, we observe with great interest how human reason struggles under self-imposed beliefs. As believers in a higher plan, we trust that this struggle will eventually lead to good, even though it currently seems purely negative to many of us. This is an intriguing aspect for those who study human nature.

Undoubtedly, millions still firmly believe as instructed by the Pope, and with slight differences, many millions of Protestants, who reject the Pope's authority, also hold a strong belief in their interpretation of inspiration. They are often more passionate about their scriptures than their Roman Catholic counterparts. This conservative and reactionary force seems necessary; it pushes for more rigor from those working to establish a dynamic understanding of inspiration, to replace what many see as outdated dogma. We believe this conservatism won't harm Christianity in the long run, as it stems from a deep, albeit blind, faith in the reality of inspiration and the importance of the unseen, which resists replacing its cherished beliefs with what it currently views as negation.

If these believers could open their minds, they would see that those working hard to clear away centuries of misunderstandings have a faith just as strong as theirs. By their dedication to truth, they are doing God's work, paving the way for a deeper understanding of His eternal Wisdom and human nature. It's true that to achieve this, these diligent individuals may be overly enthusiastic about criticism, but this enthusiasm is necessary to counteract blind conservatism. The combination of both will bring enlightenment.

On the other hand, the sharp, trained minds of scientists examine every word and letter of Scripture to challenge the claims of blind faith. Textual criticism has forever debunked the Council of Trent's assertion of a "Textus Receptus." The Accepted Text has suffered so many errors from ignorant scribes and dogmatic editors that it seems incredible anyone could believe in its literal divine inspiration. It's perhaps a mistake to call this research "Criticism," as people often interpret the term as hostile. Originally, the word simply meant to examine and judge well. A wise person, however, will not be put off by the term but will see the value in textual criticism as a powerful tool to correct human error.

Criticism doesn't stop at just investigating the text; it goes further by researching the date and history of the sacred books, analyzing and comparing their contents, and exploring their connections with other writings. In essence, it examines all aspects of Biblical literature. The findings from this research are so significant that they feel like entering a new realm of religion. However, to reach this enlightened understanding, one must overcome many challenges that blind faith alone cannot withstand; only a reasoned faith can endure these trials.

In short, the method of criticism is rational and relies on personal judgment. The great Critics of Christendom, who have sought help and guidance diligently, embody this approach. Their high moral integrity and deep religious sense make their work invaluable. It's essentially the best of Christendom evaluating itself, not an external group trying to undermine it. A religion capable of such self-criticism is vibrant and cannot die as long as this spirit remains. This spirit is just as much inspired by the Holy Ghost as is the blind faith in the "credo quia absurdum" (I believe because it is absurd) of the Roman tradition of verbal inspiration.

However, we shouldn't think of Criticism as an end in itself; it's a tool for redefining the eternal questions of religion. It's a powerful tool because it allows these questions to be understood with greater intelligence and knowledge of human nature, making them more compelling and urgent. But Criticism alone can't solve these questions; their answers depend on a higher faculty that goes beyond the science of visible things to the understanding of the unseen. This is the result that will emerge from the combination of the two great forces of progress and reaction we’ve discussed.

Even if we accept that the Bible is a collection of books mostly made up of fragments from various documents, edited multiple times over different periods; that the older parts of the Jewish scriptures borrow heavily from other nations' mythologies and distort history significantly; contain immoral teachings and obvious absurdities; and portray a God that many thoughtful people find offensive; and that the more recent Hebrew scriptures, while more elevated in spirit, still face many criticisms; and that the books of the Christian scriptures are also questioned on many points—there is still so much beauty and profound thought in the Bible's teachings. Given its long history as a perceived vehicle of God's revelation to humanity, the question of its inspiration becomes even more urgent.

What is this higher faculty that goes beyond reason, and why are its records filled with imperfections and absurdities that reason can easily identify? Scientists and scholars alone cannot fully explain this. Similarly, mystics alone cannot fully clarify the problem. What is needed is a nature born from the union of both perspectives—a nature so rare it might almost be considered nonexistent. Mystics often resist the discipline and training of science, while scholars typically refuse to acknowledge the methods of mystics. Yet, without combining both approaches, true understanding cannot be achieved.

For about three hundred years, the Western world has been developing an impressive tool for studying nature, known as the scientific method. This method has given us many new ways to understand the world, especially through the sense of history. Its achievements are so remarkable that people believe nothing like this has happened before. We look down on the past, dismiss its approaches, ignore its ideas, and are reluctant to learn from its lessons. Like all nations at their peak, we think we are the pinnacle of wisdom. This attitude is natural and necessary for the growth of our intellectual capabilities, which we take great pride in.

However, students of human nature and life sciences continue to look to the past to better predict the future. Their understanding of history goes beyond basic criticism and aims to be insightful. Over the past three centuries, we have seen extensive cataloguing, criticism, analysis, and skepticism, along with remarkable physical research across all fields. The religious have worried about the decline of faith, while rationalists have hoped for the end of superstition. What does all this mean, and what purpose does it serve? How does this struggle reflect God's wisdom? It might not be as hard as it seems to predict the answers.

Similar events happen repeatedly in nature, as human experience shows. Time is a constant reflection of eternity, and the cycle of creation is always in motion, as recognized by the wise throughout history. Where should we look in history for events similar to those of the past three hundred years? The best place to look is the history of the time when Christianity began. A few writers have already pointed out the many similarities between the social and religious aspects of that critical period and our own times, but these efforts have not received much attention, and no practical lessons have been learned from reviewing this past experience.

The experiences of humanity are our own experiences, if we are wise enough to understand them. According to a major belief in general religion, the soul of man repeatedly returns to learn life's lessons in this vast world-school. If this is true, then when similar conditions happen again, a similar group of souls returns to continue their lessons. It is possible that many of the same souls from the early centuries of Christianity are among us today. Why else would the same ideas and problems keep coming back, and why do we see the same perspectives on things? These ideas and problems cannot just appear out of nowhere; they must be brought back by minds already familiar with them.

However, it would be very unwise to insist that our parallels are identical. We must remember that while many conditions are strikingly similar, some important aspects of Graeco-Roman civilization are only faintly present in our current civilization, and some prominent features of our times are only imperfectly seen in that age. We should remember that the records from that time are often incomplete, while the history of our own era is documented in great detail. Although we can understand the main outlines of that past civilization, we can only see a part of our own, as its story isn't finished and we can't foresee the future. Additionally, the life and mindset of our time are generally more complex than they were nineteen hundred years ago, as humanity evolves. These points are important if we want to predict the future based on historical patterns.

Even a basic student of history can see a clear similarity between the general unrest and search for new ideals that marked the period before Christianity and the uncertainty and curiosity of the late nineteenth century. The trend is similar, though not identical in degree; the scientific and scholarly achievements of Alexandria before the Christian era have been greatly surpassed by those of our time. Today, life is more intense, thought is more active, experiences are broader, and the need to solve problems is more urgent. The modern mind began in Greece about 2,500 years ago, evolving through close contact with the ancient East, enabled by Alexander's conquests and later by Rome's organizational skills.

Today, it is not the conquests of Alexander the Great or the power of Rome that have built the ways of communication between nations. Instead, it is the advancements in physical science that have truly united the farthest corners of the earth, creating a global network our world has never seen before. It's no longer the speculative thinking of ancient Greece or the practical genius of Rome coming together, nor is it just the West meeting the mysticism and enthusiasm of the East. Today, it is the collective knowledge and industrious efforts of the modern Western world merging with the ancient and contemporary East.

The intense study of oriental languages and ancient texts over the past century has sparked the creation of a comparative science of ancient literature, world scriptures, and religions. This new field is gradually reshaping all our prior beliefs. Nowadays, it's not a philosopher like Porphyry questioning the authenticity of the Book of Daniel, nor a figure like Marcion challenging what would become the New Testament canon. Instead, it is the "Higher Criticism" that has dealt a significant blow to blind worship of the Bible.

The conflict between religion (or theology) and science has produced a generation eager for reconciliation. This reconciliation will come; harmony between Heaven and Earth will be restored. It happened in the past for those who sought it, and it will happen again for those who seek it today. If the human heart seeks the Light, the Light will fill it. It was true nineteen hundred years ago; people sought the Light, and it came in response to their prayers.

If this view seems strange at first to those who were taught to see the state of affairs before Christ's arrival as entirely corrupt, reading these pages may help them understand why such a great Soul was needed to help humanity. People received the Light according to their ability to comprehend it, and the Life was given to them as they were able to grow. Although the subsequent history, marked by ignorance and intolerance in Christendom for many centuries, might suggest that this Life and Light were wasted, we should remember that they were given to souls, not bodies.

The journey of individual souls cannot be traced through the evolution of races. The souls in the civilizations of Greece and Rome that were able to receive the Light were very different from those in the barbarian tribes that destroyed those civilizations and from whom new races would develop. The old races, which provided experiences for more advanced souls, were to gradually fade away, making way for new races that, in their early stages, couldn't accommodate such advanced intellects, but might attract higher souls as they matured.

This process was gradual, with significant overlap of races as old members were slowly replaced by new ones. But how could we expect the Vandals and Goths to understand the profound issues that fascinated the philosophers and mystics of Greece and Rome? Moreover, wouldn't all this have been anticipated and planned by the Wisdom that oversees human affairs?

Races and nations are born and die, just like people; they can have long or short lives and can be good, bad, or indifferent. Regardless of their characteristics compared to other races, their early period is like childhood, their middle period is like adulthood, and their later period is like old age. Generally, different types of souls seek experiences in these different stages: childhood, middle age, and old age. There are many exceptions to this, as the situation is complex and varied, making it impossible to fully understand. Races and nations often overlap and blend into each other, making it difficult to pinpoint their exact beginnings and ends. The stages of their development and decline are not clearly defined. However, we can still identify the main phases of their evolution and see the differences between these stages.

Our Western world, representing modern thinking, has had its childhood period. It was born from Greek and Roman civilizations and went through a natural phase of ignorance and passion during its early years. This helps us understand the otherwise depressing periods of the dark and middle ages in Europe; they were natural parts of its childhood, followed by intellectual growth during youth and early adulthood. Now, the Western world seems to be reaching maturity, and we can hope it will start to think and act more responsibly, leaving childish ways behind.

The issues that will engage the attention of our advanced intelligence in the future were hinted at during its early development, and our immediate task is to explore some of those early indications.

## Some Basic Outlines of the Background of Gnosis

### Preliminary Thoughts

The well-known story of the origins of Christianity is deeply ingrained in the consciousness of the Western world. It is woven into our memories and has been impressed upon us from a young age, making us unlikely to question it. It has become something we are accustomed to, supported by the strong force of tradition, which few can resist. However, if an ordinary person wants to learn more about what is often called the greatest story ever told, they must start questioning and investigating. Previously, they might have believed that the story was unique and entirely supernatural. If they analyze their understanding, they will find that the story appears isolated from any historical context.

Moreover, they will find it challenging to provide that historical context, no matter how hard they try. They may read many books about the "Life and Times of our Lord," only to discover that these books often shape the environment to fit the story rather than providing an accurate historical setting. In short, they won't feel connected to the natural environment they are seeking. There are, of course, some works that do not follow this pattern, but the general reader rarely encounters them because they are often considered "dangerous" or "disturbing."

If we delve deeper into the origins of Christianity, even with access to the largest libraries, we find that no writer has yet provided a thorough description of the early environment. Without this understanding, we cannot fully grasp the nature of early Christianity and its ability to adapt to its surroundings. Looking at evidence from the first two centuries, we see not one Church and one form of faith, but many communities and diverse modes of expression—communities focused on living a spiritual life and expressing their beliefs.

In these communities, we often find connections with the best aspects of universal religion, giving us more confidence in understanding the origins. Unlike the later sharp divide between science (or philosophy) and religion (or theology), many of these early communities believed that religion was a science. They claimed that the soul's matters could be known as clearly as physical ones. They did not limit their spiritual insights to blind faith or simple intellects but believed they could formulate a world-philosophy that satisfied even the most demanding intellects.

Never before has the world seen more daring attempts to solve its greatest problems than those made by some of these mystical philosophers and religious scientists. Their efforts are mostly incomprehensible to us today, partly because our records of them are incomplete and partly because it's naturally impossible to fully express the vast realities they aimed to understand. Despite this, when we grasp their true nature, their boldness can inspire our admiration. If we set aside our biases, we can respect the power that drove their efforts.

They sought knowledge of God, the science of reality, and the wisdom of existence. Their goal was wisdom, and they studied the sacred aspects of life. They were called many names by those who later pulled them from their hidden places to ridicule and condemn their beliefs. The name that has stuck is "Gnostics," those who sought Gnosis. However, one of their earliest documents states that Gnosis is merely the beginning of the journey, with the end goal being God. Thus, the Gnostics were those who used Gnosis to start their path towards God.

A key question for historians is: Where did these men come from? Did they suddenly appear in a world indifferent to their pursuits? Were they disconnected from the past, or did they have predecessors?Certainly not; those who fiercely opposed them, claiming to be the true heirs of Christ's teachings, angrily labeled the Gnostics as "the first-born of Satan." These critics can help guide us to some materials to base an answer on. In a less heated tone, the Church Fathers tell us that Gnostic doctrines stem from Plato, Pythagoras, Aristotle, Heracleitus, and the Mysteries and Initiations of various nations, not from Christ. Let's briefly explore this lead to sketch the background of Gnosis, so we can better decide if we agree with the heresy-hunters' accusations.

We will only touch on the vast research needed to understand the context of early Christianity. One must study the political history and social conditions of the time, but most crucially, the nature of the religious world, especially during the three centuries before our era. How can we, as we examine the blending of cults, the merging of religious beliefs, and the mix of faiths in these centuries, separate them into their original elements? This task seems as difficult as tracing the mixtures of races and nations that led to these religious blends.

Where do we start? If we begin where recorded history ends (as often happens) and assume we have reached a primitive state, each new archaeological and ethnological discovery forces us to revise our theories. Tribes we once considered primitive savages are actually the decaying remnants of once-great nations. Their superstitions and barbarous practices are mixed with high ideas that savagery alone could not produce. Where do we begin in this ever-changing material? We can't trace it solely through material evolution. Perhaps we must also consider the "soul of a people."

Just as individuals are born from other individuals, nations are born from nations. However, if tracing a person's physical heritage is complex (as it branches out the further back you go), tracing a nation's heritage is even more difficult. A person has two parents, but a nation can have many, and while a person's parents' bodies decay in the earth, a nation's decay is visible and persists through its descendants and shared history with other nations. Nations have distinguishing characteristics, but they aren't individualized like people; understanding their inner heredity is more challenging than understanding an animal's soul because it is on a larger scale.

Given the nature of how general religious consciousness is carried, it is not surprising that the history of religious ideas is one of the most challenging studies. Keeping all these factors in mind, it takes great courage to attempt any generalizations. We feel that every statement needs so many qualifications that it seems crude, and we realize we're only outlining the skeletons when we should be bringing them to life.

To return to the background of the specific period and movement we are focusing on, three main influences merge together in the turbulent times of these critical centuries. These three elements—Greece, Egypt, and Judaism—combine and transform in the early centuries of the Christian era. They nurture and watch over the new beginnings, sharing both their rational and spiritual heritages, with the spirit being illuminated by Christ. We will focus on the rational and spiritual aspects of these traditions, as they reveal the deeper side of the religions of Judaism, Egypt, and Greece.

### Greece

To understand this, we must look beyond the common practices of the people and delve into the teachings of philosophers, sages, prophets, and priests. In ancient times, religion had many levels, each suited to different levels of human understanding. The deeper teachings were reserved for those capable of comprehending them, found in mystery schools and initiation rites across all great nations. These institutions often held the highest and sometimes the most corrupted forms of their religions. We will address the negative aspects elsewhere.

First, let us consider the intellectual religion of Greece. If we look at Greece in the sixth century B.C., we can see signs of a new spirit emerging in the Western world, marking the start of significant intellectual activity. It's like the Greek genius is reaching its adolescence, with new ways of thinking coming to life. The old myths and ancient wisdom are being reinterpreted through early science and the birth of philosophy. This surge in activity is part of a broader awakening happening in other regions as well, reflecting a heightened religious consciousness among nations, which had a notable impact on Greece.

The most distinctive feature of this period is the application of intellect to religious matters, due to the rapid development of human thinking. The key figures of this movement are still renowned today, such as Confucius and Laozi in the Far East, Gautama Buddha in India, the last Zoroaster in Persia, and Pythagoras in Greece. There were likely others whose contributions are less documented. For those who believe in a guiding wisdom in human affairs, it seems plausible that this was part of a grand plan for human progress. If there is a Providence guiding us, its influence is evident in such significant events.

Focusing on Greece, we shouldn't think that Pythagoras had no predecessors. Although his followers might claim that all philosophy originated from him, it's hard to believe it appeared so suddenly. Pythagoras likely saw himself as a proclaimer of ancient truths and one of many teachers in a longstanding tradition. He had Pherecydes, Anaximander, and Thales before him in Asia Minor, along with other teachers in Egypt, Chaldaea, and elsewhere. In those early days, it was almost impossible to separate philosophy from mythology and the ancient ideas connected to it. Looking back to the time of Thales, who is considered the pioneer of philosophy in the Greek world and lived a century before Pythagoras, we find the following situation:

The educated Greeks of the time viewed Egypt as the center of all learning and culture, while they considered their own ancestors insignificant in such matters. The rhapsodists who recited the Homeric poems flattered their audiences by praising the great deeds of their ancient heroes, but they offered little insight into religion. Hesiod and others could make little sense of these matters either. Hesiod was more understandable than the ancient Orphic poems, which contained the oldest elements of the religious tradition of Hellas, but he still fell short of Egyptian wisdom. The Orphic fragments were seen as relics of their barbaric ancestors, believed only by the superstitious and ignorant.

However, for a nation to develop its own identity rather than just copying others, it must have confidence in its past traditions. Around this time, there was a growing interest in these old fragments, leading to their collection and translation into the contemporary Greek language. This happened at the end of the sixth century, and the person most closely associated with this effort was Onomacritus.

It's interesting to note that this activity took place just before Greece repelled Xerxes' invading forces from Europe. The effort aimed to revive Greece's past by reconnecting with its ancient inspiration while allowing it to express its unique genius through new interpretations of old wisdom. This would boost Greece's confidence to resist Eastern invasions and prepare for future conquests, like those of Alexander.

During this time, philosophy and the Orphic tradition emerged. Additionally, there was significant activity in Greece's sacred religious institutions—the Mysteries. But before we delve into this crucial point, let's briefly review the Orphic tradition. Scholars in later Greece believed that this tradition descended from Orpheus through Pythagoras and Plato.

The Greeks known to history were likely part of an Aryan migration into Europe, consisting of many smaller groups. According to records from the priests of Sais, shared with Solon and preserved by Plato in "Critias" and "Timaeus," Attica had been inhabited by the ancestors of the Hellenes as far back as ten thousand years ago. Then came a massive flood that destroyed the Atlantic Island and made the Mediterranean shores uninhabitable due to several seismic disturbances, the third of which was the "Flood of Deucalion." This period is also mentioned in Manetho's writings as the time in Egypt "before the flood"

If this is true, we can imagine how the wave of the conquering Aryan race, which then occupied Greece—the rulers over the native people of that time—was pushed back, and how the country was left for a long time to these same natives, whom Herodotus calls "Pelasgians." They were to the Greeks what the Dravidians were and are to the Indo-Aryans: natives, but with a long history of their own if we could recover their records. The government of the ancient Greek inhabitants of Attica, according to the writings of Solon, bears a striking resemblance to the government of the ancient Aryans in India, and their early religious traditions likely came from a common source.

As for the "Pelasgians," who knows their traditions, or the racial mixings that happened before they could be classified as a mixed group? We are told that they were ruled by chiefs from the Atlantic Island who aggressively expanded their conquests to the farthest shores of the Mediterranean, and that the ancient Greeks contested their rule. This situation presents enormous possibilities for cultural and religious blends and mixtures.

These Atlanteans introduced the worship of Poseidon and Hephaestus (Vulcan), the powerful gods of the sea and underground fire, which had destroyed their ancestors. For the Aryan Greek people, there was All-father Zeus and the Goddess of Wisdom, Pallas Athene, who was also a warrior goddess, fitting for a warlike people. What the Greek religion was like at this time, who can say? But it is not unreasonable to suppose that it may have been bardic in nature—songs and hymns suited to warriors, of which we have remnants in the legends of Druids and Bards and in all those ancient traditions of the Celts, in the mythology of the Teutons and Norsemen, and even in the legends preserved by the ancient Slavs.

In the early years, as the powerful Aryan migrations pushed forward, waves of people clashed with each other, making the fertile land of Hellas a valuable prize for the strongest groups. Over time, as the chaos settled and seismic disturbances decreased, the Hellenic people reclaimed their lands, not just in Greece but also along the shores of Asia Minor. However, it's uncertain how many waves of immigrants arrived before the time of Homer. Perhaps one day we might be able to separate historical facts from myths and understand that leaders like Cecrops, Erectheus, and Ion did not quickly follow one another, but were significant figures who founded kingdoms separated by long periods.

It is possible that these conquering kings were accompanied by bards who offered advice, encouragement, and religious guidance. Maybe we can find the origin of Orpheus here and trace the oldest religious poems to one of the later waves of immigrants. We can almost imagine a religious procession moving down the Sacred Way to Eleusis, the holiest place in Greece, with an Orpheus-like figure inspiring warriors with his songs, harp in hand, and his grey hair flowing in the wind. The warriors' rhythmic march and the clashing of their shields would have matched the song's rhythm. Any religious expression at that time would have been inspirational, prophetic, and oracular, which are key characteristics of Orphic tradition. But even then, was the tradition pure?

The various races likely fought their way through other groups and settled temporarily among them before reaching Greece. Their main route seems to have been around the southern shores of the Black Sea and through Thrace. In Thrace, they encountered the cult of Dionysus and absorbed some of its traditions. However, Thrace was not the origin of this cult, which appears to have ancient roots extending eastward and back in time, likely linked to early Semitic traditions. These origins are hard to trace due to the obscure and fragmented records we have today.

Additionally, there is some influence from Chaldean traditions in the Orphic line, but it's unclear whether this influence existed at that time or was added later. We cannot say precisely what the religion of these early settlers in Greece was like once they became more civilized, as we have no records. However, they were likely guided and inspired to meet their needs.

If we examine Homer's Greece for traces of Orpheus, we will be disappointed. Homer describes a Greece that seems to have forgotten its ancient bards, focusing instead on heroes who left their religious traditions behind. The Greeks who gained supremacy after Ion's time were not very religious. They seem more like Viking warriors, uninterested in the agricultural pursuits of their predecessors, as suggested by Hesiod's tradition. We see many independent chieftains in Greece whose solution to population growth was through raids and conquests.

There may have been a whimsical Helen and a very charming Paris who broke the rules of hospitality, but the Trojan War was more likely a raid by these warriors to gain new lands. This raid was not against a foreign race but against people of their own general kin. The Trojans were Greeks, perhaps influenced by Asian customs due to their settlement, but still Greeks—dark-haired Greeks, with a culture much like that of the fair-haired ones, and probably with just as little understanding of it.

The absence of priests or their very minor roles suggests the early development of independent thought, a key characteristic of the Greek mind that later flourished. This independence was carefully preserved in historical Greece to fulfill its destined purpose for the world. It was good for people to face the gods bravely and challenge them if necessary. "Homer" was the poet of these warrior heroes, but "Orpheus" was the poet of their predecessors, Greeks of the Hellenic stock that they had dominated.

The descendants of the Trojan heroes naturally looked to "Homer" as the singer of their ancestors' deeds and customs. They were too proud to listen to "Orpheus" and the old theologians who had been the poets of the conquered. Thus, the old songs and legends of this earlier Greece were left to the common people, leading to their neglect and misunderstanding.

When philosophy emerged in the seventh century, it became clear to a few thinkers that Homer’s works did not meet the religious needs of thoughtful people. Homer’s writings lacked the depth found in the religious traditions of Egypt and Chaldea, and it seemed that the Greeks had no significant religious heritage; their ancestors appeared uncivilized.

At this point, some individuals decided to gather and compare the ancient oracles and religious myths of their people—the remnants of the Orphic songs. In doing so, they discovered evidence of an ancient Greek tradition of unseen truths that could favorably compare with the religious knowledge of Egypt and Chaldea. This proved that Greece did have a religious tradition and that their ancestors were not barbarians.

Those who dedicated themselves to these studies during this crucial period were likely guided in their efforts, and poets and thinkers received help as needed. The surviving fragments of Orphic poetry show signs of this inspiration. We are not talking about the later "Orphic Hymns," which can be read in Taylor’s English translation, but about the ancient fragments found in the works of classical and early Christian writers. Many of these fragments were based on pre-Homeric traditions and looked back to these early sources for their foundation.

However, the mystical and mythological nature of these poems, their passionate and prophetic qualities, while sufficient for many, did not suit the emerging intellectual spirit of Greece. Thus, the leading thinkers of the time sought ways to present these ideas, initially expressed in myths and poetry, in a form more suitable for the intellectuals of their era. This effort gave rise to the philosophy of Pythagoras and later, Plato.

Alongside public religious practices and popular traditions, there existed a hidden aspect of religion within the Mystery institutions. Understanding the evolution of popular religious ideas in Greece is challenging, but tracing the various Mystery traditions is even more difficult. These traditions were held in the highest regard and kept extremely secret, with any breach of the oath punishable by death.

The underlying idea of the Mystery traditions in Greece was similar to those in other ancient cultures, and it is hard to find any significant cult without this secretive aspect. Within these institutions, in the inner sanctums of the temples, people could deeply participate in the cult and learn its doctrines. The Mysteries are the most fascinating aspect of the study of religion. Ancient beliefs held that there were secrets or mysteries in religion that one could be initiated into, and that religious understanding unfolded gradually, almost like a science of the soul and the unseen world.

A common tradition among the great Mystery institutions was that their founders introduced all the arts of civilization, either as gods themselves or as individuals taught by the gods. In essence, these founders were believed to possess far greater knowledge than those who came after them; they were seen as the teachers of early human societies. They not only taught the practical arts but also provided instruction on the nature of the gods, the human soul, the unseen world, the creation of the world, and many other subjects.

The ancient world was deeply influenced by these institutions. They came from all walks of life, from the purest and noblest to the most degraded. Among them, we find the best and worst aspects of human religion and superstition. This is not surprising because when human nature is heightened, both the good and the bad in it are amplified. When knowledge is gained, power follows, and it's up to individuals whether they use it for good or evil. Throughout history, teachers of humanity have faced opposition from inherent selfishness, as evolution is slow and people are unpredictable. Moreover, people cannot be forced to change; they must do so willingly, because "love fulfills the law." Therefore, although many are called, few are chosen.

It is said that the earliest teachers of humanity, who founded the Mystery institutions to educate early humans on higher matters, were more advanced souls from a higher form of humanity than our own. The early humans were like children, with underdeveloped minds that could only understand what they could clearly see and feel. According to this view, in ancient times, the Mysteries were led by those who possessed knowledge of nature's powers, knowledge acquired by a previous, perfected humanity that wasn't necessarily from Earth. The wonders they demonstrated were beyond what our early humans could achieve on their own.

As time passed and humanity developed reasoning abilities, the teachers gradually withdrew, leaving the Mysteries in the hands of the most advanced students of our humanity. These students had to use symbols, devices, dramas, and theatrical representations to convey what had previously been revealed through more direct means. Corruption began to spread, and humans had to achieve their own progress through self-discipline and constant struggle against their baser instincts. The teachers remained unseen, always ready to help, but no longer visibly among people to command their reverence and worship. This is the tradition.

While tracing the origin and evolution of popular Greek religions is difficult, the beginnings and development of the Greek Mystery cults are even harder to discern. The main feature of the Mysteries was the deep secrecy surrounding their traditions, leaving us with few reliable sources and mostly hints and indirect references.

What is clear, however, is that the Mysteries represented an initiation into higher religious practices and doctrines. The greatest Greek thinkers highly praised the Mysteries, saying they purified one's nature, helped people live better lives on earth, and allowed them to face death with greater hope for the future. Speculating about the early traditions of the Mystery cults, such as those of Orphic, Dionysiac, and Eleusinian descent, is unnecessary in this brief overview.

By the time of Plato, there were Mystery institutions that could be broadly categorized as political, private, and philosophical. The political Mysteries, or State Mysteries, were exemplified by the famous Eleusinia, known for their magnificent public ceremonies and profound inner rites. During this period, almost every respectable Athenian citizen was initiated, suggesting that the entry requirements could not have been very strict, given the large number of initiates each year.

Over time, the State-Mysteries, which were meant to guide people in right living and understanding, became routine and lost their depth, as often happens with state religions. Alongside the official Eleusinian Mysteries, many private religious practices arose, not recognized by the state. These grew in number and included various Oriental Mystery cults that found followers in Greece. This is evident from the study of Greek religious associations like the Thiasi, Erani, and Orgeones.

These private societies sometimes included undesirable elements, but they also fulfilled the spiritual needs of those who found the state religion lacking. Among these private groups were communities of strict ascetics, both men and women, dedicated to holy living. These individuals were known as Orphics and were said to live the "Orphic life." While there were impostors who mimicked their purity and knowledge, we focus on those whose actions matched their beliefs.

Orphic communities became havens for those seeking a religious life, including the Pythagorean schools. Pythagoras did not create something entirely new in Greece with his school at Crotona; he expanded on existing traditions. When his original school was disbanded and its members were forced to flee, they found refuge among the Orphics. Thus, the Pythagorean schools eventually merged into the Orphic communities. In the Pythagorean tradition, we find signs of what I call the philosophic Mysteries. Therefore, we should look to the best of the Orphic and Pythagorean traditions to understand the true nature of the Mysteries, rather than the political Eleusinian Mysteries or the chaotic elements of Oriental cults.

The Orphics significantly improved the Eleusinian Mysteries and supported them as essential for educating the common man about higher spiritual life. However, the Mysteries that fulfilled the aspirations of the Orphics and Pythagoreans were of a higher order than the state-sponsored Mysteries accessible to ordinary citizens. The Pythagoreans were renowned in ancient times for their pure lives and lofty goals, so the Mysteries they respected deeply must have been beyond the Eleusinia—perhaps the Eleusinia were just an introduction to these deeper Mysteries.

To understand the deepest religious life of Greece, we must look in this direction and remember that the inner experiences of this life were kept secret and not publicly displayed. Pythagoras is said to have been initiated into the Egyptian, Chaldean, Orphic, and Eleusinian Mysteries. He was also a major founder of Greek philosophy. However, his philosophy was not an isolated discipline; it was the application of his intellect—particularly his mathematical genius—to the best aspects of these Mystery traditions. He understood it was necessary to guide the swiftly developing intellect of Greece towards contemplating the inner nature of things; otherwise, in its newfound freedom, it might completely disregard the ancient wisdom.

Plato continued this work, but in a somewhat different way; he was more engaged with the world than Pythagoras, and his main effort was to clear away misconceptions so that the intellect could be purified and ready to contemplate the true nature of things. He dedicated his life to this task, not so much building a system of knowledge, but making way for the great truths that Pythagoras referred to as the "Gnosis of things-that-are" to become evident on their own.

It is incorrect to think that Plato created a new system of philosophy; his main ideas were part of the ancient wisdom passed down by the seers of the Mysteries. Instead of formulating these ideas, he cleared the way with his method so that the mind could be ready to receive them. This is why the conclusions of his dialogues are almost always negative, and only at the end of his life, probably against his better judgment and because of his students' demands, did he present a positive document in the Timaeus, composed of fragments from the unpublished writings of Pythagoreans and others.

Unfortunately, most of his immediate followers misunderstood his dialectical method as an end in itself. Instead of living the philosophical life and seeking true initiation, they fell into empty argument and ended in negation. Aristotle followed with his excellent method of analysis and precise observation of phenomena. Since he focused on the external rather than the internal, he was in some ways better understood than Plato, but also more misunderstood, as his method was also taken as an end in itself rather than a means.

This brings us to the three centuries before the current era, when the intellectual life of Greece was centered in Alexandria. The Greece described here was much larger than the Greece of Plato's time. It was a Greece that had physically conquered the East and believed its intellectual strength could conquer the world. Everywhere, it tested its intellect against the ancient East and, for a time, thought it was winning. Its independence in thought led to many different schools of thought competing with each other, similar to what we've seen in modern Europe over the last three hundred years. There was the same intellectual activity that led to the modern scientific method, along with the same breaking down of old beliefs, unrest, and skepticism.

On the surface, it might seem like Greece had forgotten its ancient mystical traditions and relied only on its intellect. But if we look deeper, this isn't true. In Plato's time, knowledge from the East and Egypt came to Greece. Later, Greeks traveled to Egypt and the East. Ancient wisdom was rooted in Egypt and the East. The Orphic and Pythagorean communities in Plato's time brought a modified form of Eastern thought to Greece, adapting it to their own traditions. When many Greeks traveled to the East, those who had been influenced by these schools became more closely connected with ancient Eastern wisdom and absorbed it eagerly.

The introduction of Orientalism into Greece brought both negative and positive changes. It led to undesirable practices and enthusiastic rituals but also enriched religious life and fulfilled spiritual needs. Similarly, when the Greeks conquered the East, it spread skepticism and unbelief, but it also sharpened intellectual abilities. This transformation happened gradually. As skepticism grew, many people sought refuge in a contemplative life that promised knowledge. Oriental thinkers and mystics adopted Greek philosophies like those of Pythagoras and Plato, while Greek philosophers absorbed Eastern influences through contact with various communities across Egypt, Asia Minor, and even Greece itself.

The prevalence of these communities in the first century can be observed in the writings of Philo Judaeus, the life of Apollonius of Tyana, Plutarch’s ethical and theosophical essays, and numerous recently discovered inscriptions about the many Religious Associations in Greece. When the Greek kingdoms of Alexander’s Successors fell to Rome, the Romans organized and controlled the world, much like the British did in India. However, the Romans, with their legal and practical mindset, never fully embraced the metaphysical complexities of Greek philosophy or Eastern mysticism.

In literature and art, Rome could only imitate Greece. In philosophy, Rome sought guidance on how to live rather than pursuing knowledge for its own sake. Therefore, its most notable figures followed Stoic naturalism, which emphasized the ideal of "honor." Nonetheless, Rome, like Greece, could not avoid religious influences from the East. Rome experienced similar religious encounters as Greece, though to a lesser extent. The main point of connection among the various religions in the Roman Empire was the common worship of the Sun. From around 70 B.C. onward, the core of this popular worship was found in the Mysteries of Mithras.

The worship of Mithras, or the sun-god, was the most popular pagan cult and the main rival to Christianity during the first four centuries A.D. According to Christian leaders like Justin Martyr, the Devil had imitated Christian rites in the Mysteries of Mithras. The Mithraic Mysteries were the secretive aspect of a widespread international religious movement. This movement was made possible by the unification of many peoples into the Graeco-Roman world and resulted from the interaction between Greece, Rome, and Eastern thought.

Local and national cults were gradually influenced by the symbolic traditions of the Chaldaeo-Persian heritage. The worship of the Spiritual Sun, or Logos, represented by the physical sun, was common to all major cults and gradually influenced popular local religions with its solar symbolism. Over time, Mithra, known as the visible sun to the uneducated and the Spiritual Sun and Mediator between Light and Darkness to the enlightened, as Plutarch tells us, spread his influence throughout the Roman Empire. His outer worship overshadowed localized national religions, and his Mysteries influenced the mystery cults of the ancient Western world.

### Egypt

Let us now turn to Egypt and look at the background necessary to understand the Gnosis. Despite her disdain for Greek intellect, Egypt shared her wisdom with Greece even during the early Ptolemaic period. There was significant translation activity, mostly associated with Manetho. It is likely that Plutarch derived much of his information on the Mysteries of Isis from Manetho.

The doctrines presented as Egypt's traditional wisdom have many connections with Greek Trismegistic literature, the mystical and philosophical writings used in Hermetic schools. These communities preserved the wisdom of Thoth, the God of Wisdom, whose name, according to Jamblichus, was synonymous with inspiration for all priests. The Greeks, seeing similarities between their Hermes and Thoth, called him Hermes Trismegistus, or Thrice-Great, because of his profound wisdom.

The contents, though not the form, of the oldest writings in the Trismegistic literature were largely Egyptian, as evidenced by Jamblichus in his treatise on the Mysteries of the Egyptians and Chaldaeans. By examining the connections between Egypt and Greece, we can explore Egyptian wisdom in its original context and discover many fully developed doctrines that we might otherwise have thought were unique to Christianity. In the Trismegistic literature, we find several key doctrines of Gnostic Christianity, but without the historical figure of Christ. These doctrines, such as the Logos, the Saviour and Virgin Mother, the second birth, and final union with God, had existed in Egyptian tradition for thousands of years.

Just as in Greece, Egyptian tradition also experienced a mix of doctrines, syncretism, and blendings, not only in popular cults but also in inner traditions. For example, there was a significant Semitic influence dating back to the Hyksos period (2000-1500 B.C.). During that time, Seth, who might have been associated with the supreme deity in the language of the Semitic conquerors, was a highly respected name. It was linked with Sothis, or Sirius, the guardian star of Egypt, and the Mysteries of Seth were likely blended in some way with those of Osiris.

After the despised Hyksos were expelled, Seth or Set gradually came to be associated with Typhon, the enemy of Osiris, the Logos. However, this does not change the true teachings of the Mysteries of Seth, just as the Iranian Aryans' use of the name Daevos for evil entities did not alter the benevolent nature of the Devas for the Indo-Aryans. This simply shows a rivalry of cultures and races, indicating a time when these groups and their religions were closely connected. Similarly, the Christian use of the term Demon doesn't negate the fact that the Greek Daimones were benevolent beings, like the Daimon of Socrates who guided him away from wrongdoing.

The ancient political ties between Chaldaea and Egypt, revealed by archaeological research, and the later Persian conquest of Egypt, likely created religious exchanges, especially in the Mystery traditions. Future research in the largely unexplored fields of Egyptology will likely shed more light on the mixed heritage of Egyptian religion, which may be even more complex than that of Greek cults.

Despite our current difficulties in categorizing them, we cannot deny the grandeur of many inner Egyptian religious concepts. The vast and enigmatic background of Egyptian cults, along with the impressive phrases and titles we extract from the myths and symbols, suggests a profound inner working. The mystics’ devotion to the "Birth of Horus" symbolizes the greatest mystery of all: the spiritual rebirth of man, where he becomes a god and a son of the Father.

According to Greek writers, the Egyptians once had a priesthood with greater wisdom than in later times. They admitted that they had fallen from this high standard and lost much of their knowledge. Despite this, the desire for wisdom remained strong among many Egyptians, making Egypt one of the most religious countries in the world. Around AD 25, the Jewish writer Philo noted that wisdom-seekers could be found throughout the world, both in Greek and non-Greek regions. In Egypt, especially around Alexandria, there were many such individuals, whom Philo called Therapeuts.

Therapeuts either claimed superior healing abilities, treating both souls and bodies, or were considered servants of God. Philo described one of their communities, which was part of mystic Judaism, but there were many other similar communities. These groups were dedicated to seeking wisdom and living holy lives. They kept no records and remained separate from the world, which knew little about them. These secret brotherhoods were crucial in the lineage of Gnosis. To fully understand these Healers, one would need to thoroughly examine all of Philo's extensive works, a task beyond the scope of this brief overview.

Since this matter is extremely important, we must provide the reader with a translation of the main source from Philo's writings, which is where we get our information. Before presenting the translation, a brief introduction is needed. In 1895, Conybeare's excellent edition of Philo's famous treatise "On the Contemplative Life" clarified one of the misconceptions about its origins. The full title of this significant work is "Philo on the Contemplative Life, or the Fourth Book of the Treatise concerning the Virtues," critically edited with a defense of its authenticity by Fred C. Conybeare, M.A. (Oxford, 1895). This book also includes an excellent bibliography of related works.

Philo's extensive works survived the neglect and vandalism of the Dark and Middle Ages because Eusebius, in his attempt to write history without sufficient materials, eagerly used Philo's description of the Therapeut order and boldly claimed it to be the earliest Christian Church of Alexandria. This view went unchallenged until the rise of Protestantism. It was questioned because the Papal party used this treatise to defend the antiquity of Christian monasticism.

For three centuries, Protestant scholars have focused their criticism on this position of the Roman and Greek Churches. If the treatise were genuine, it would mean that the earliest Church consisted of strict ascetics, both men and women, and that monasticism, which Protestants strongly opposed, existed from the beginning. After three centuries of debate, a theory perfected by scholars Gratz, Nicolas, and Lucius has been accepted by most leading Protestant scholars, claiming to have discredited the controversial document for good.

According to this theory, the Therapeutae are still considered Christians, as they were by Eusebius, but they are no longer seen as early Christians. The claim that Philo wrote the work is said to be false, and the ascetics described in it are actually monks from around 300 A.D.; the treatise is assumed to have been forged around that time. As a result, recent Protestant Church histories, dictionaries, and encyclopedias are filled with references to the so-called "Pseudo-Philo."

Until 1895, this theory was widely accepted, but Conybeare's work challenged it and undermined its foundations. Surprisingly, it was only then that a critical text of this much-debated treatise was made available. Conybeare meticulously compared all the manuscripts and versions, and matched every distinctive phrase and technical term with extensive references from Philo's other works, which are often overlooked. He also included a thorough analysis supporting the idea that Philo did write "De Vita Contemplativa." If Philo didn't write it, then the principles of literary criticism would be meaningless. The evidence provided by Conybeare, a former Fellow of University College, strongly supports the treatise's authenticity. This marks a new direction in the study of Philo's works.

The risk to certain traditional beliefs posed by a thorough study of Philo's works is highlighted in the final paragraph of Conybeare's preface, where he writes:

> It is almost unbelievable and somewhat embarrassing for Oxford as a place of learning that not a single line of Philo, nor any work specifically about him, is recommended for students in our Honour School of Theology. This is despite the fact that this deeply spiritual author has been acknowledged, either explicitly or implicitly, by a long line of Catholic teachers—from Eusebius and Ambrose in the fourth century to Bull and Dollinger in modern times—as the father of both Christian interpretation and, to a large extent, Christian doctrine" (op. cit., p. x.).

This confirms that the De Vita Contemplativa is truly a work of Philo. Regarding its date, there are some challenges, but Conybeare's expert opinion assures us that "every re-reading of Philo's works strengthens my belief that the D.V.C. is one of his earliest works" (op. cit., p. 276).

Since Philo was born around 30 B.C., the treatise can be roughly dated to the first quarter of the first century ("around the year 22 or 23"—op. cit., p. 290). This raises the question: At such a date, could Philo's Therapeuts be identified with the earliest Christian Church of Alexandria? If the accepted dates of Christian origins are correct, the answer is definitely no. However, if the accepted dates are incorrect, then a major issue arises, crucial for understanding the origins of the Christian faith. Regardless, the contents of the D.V.C. are extremely important and interesting, offering us a glimpse into those mysterious communities that Christians have long recognized as their predecessors.

The Therapeuts were not Christians; Philo knew absolutely nothing about Christianity as we understand it today. So, who were they? Answering this question requires a complete reevaluation of the accepted history of the origins. Some manuscripts of the treatise carry the title "The Suppliants, or Concerning the Virtues, Book IV., or Concerning the Virtue of the Suppliants, Book IV." Philo explains that by "Suppliant," he means "someone who has fled to God and taken refuge with Him." It is very likely that this tract was part of the fourth book of Philo's extensive work De Legatione, of which only fragments remain.

Time and Christian editors have altered De Legatione in several ways. Firstly, a significant portion of the second book has been removed, possibly because it contradicted Christian tradition concerning Pontius Pilate. Secondly, the entire fourth book was removed as it stood alone as a whole; the first part of it has been lost except for the fragment on the Essenes, which Eusebius preserved in the Praeparatio Evangelica. The account of the Therapeutae was separated and preserved as an independent book. Thirdly, the fifth book, which was a retraction, has been lost.

Now, let's focus on the tractate itself.

### Philo on the Contemplative Life

Since I have already discussed the Essaeans, who diligently practice a life of action, carrying it out in most aspects, I will now proceed to talk about those who embrace a life of contemplation. I will do this without adding my own embellishments, as poets and historians often do when they lack good material. Instead, I will stick to the truth, even though I know that even the most skilled writer might fail to convey it accurately.

Nonetheless, the effort must be made because the virtue of these people should not be left unspoken by those who believe that no good thing should be kept silent. The purpose of these wisdom-seekers is clear from their name. They are called Therapeutae and Therapeutrides (men and women), either because they practice a form of healing superior to that found in cities (which only heals bodies, while this heals souls afflicted by difficult and rare diseases such as pleasure, desire, grief, fear, selfishness, folly, and injustice, among many other passions and vices), or because they have been trained by nature and sacred laws to serve that which is greater than the Good, purer than the One, and more ancient than the Monad.

Philo then digresses, contrasting the ignorant worship of external rituals by the misinformed in all religions with the true worship of Deity by those who lead a contemplative life. Those who are satisfied with worshipping externals are blind and should remain so. He emphasizes that he is not talking about physical sight, but the sight of the soul, which is the only way to distinguish truth from falsehood.

> As for the devotees, who are continually learning to see more clearly, they should strive to understand true reality, transcending the physical sun and instead focusing on the divine Light. They should never abandon this path, which leads to perfect happiness. Those who dedicate themselves to divine service do so not out of tradition or following someone’s advice, but out of a divine love, similar to those initiated into the Bacchic and Corybantic Mysteries; they are passionate for God until they see the object of their love.
>
> Because of their longing for eternal and blessed Life, they consider their mortal life as already over. They willingly give their possessions to their children or other relatives, making them their heirs ahead of time. If they have no relatives, they give their property to their companions and friends.

Philo then contrasts the sober, orderly abandonment of property to pursue a philosophical life—which he praises—with the exaggerated legends that claim Anaxagoras and Democritus let their estates be consumed by cattle when they fell in love with wisdom.

> When these lovers of wisdom renounce their possessions, they are not swayed by anyone but proceed without looking back, leaving behind brothers, children, wives, parents, all their family ties, friendships, and the lands where they were born and raised, as familiarity is a powerful lure.
>
> They do not move to another city like mistreated or worthless slaves who, when seeking to buy their freedom, only end up with new masters instead of gaining real freedom. Every city, even the best-governed one, is full of countless conflicts, dangers, and disorders that would be unbearable to someone who has chosen wisdom as their guide. Instead, they live outside the city walls in secluded woods or enclosed lands seeking solitude. This isn't because they dislike other people, but because they understand that constant interaction with those who have different values is unproductive and harmful.
>
> This natural group of people can be found in many parts of the world, both Greek and non-Greek, sharing in the pursuit of the highest good. In Egypt, they are numerous in every region, especially around Alexandria. Those who are most advanced come to what is considered the Therapeutic homeland, a place well-suited for their way of life. This area is located on a small plateau overlooking Lake Mareotis, just south of Alexandria. It is an ideal spot, providing both security and a mild climate. Security is ensured by the surrounding homesteads and villages, while the mild climate is due to the constant breezes from the lake, which opens into the sea, and from the nearby sea itself. The breezes from the sea are light, while those from the lake are heavier, creating a very healthy atmosphere.
>
> The community's dwellings are very simple, designed only to provide shelter from the extreme heat of the sun and the extreme cold of the air. The dwellings are not as close together as those in towns because proximity is bothersome to those seeking solitude. However, they are not too far apart either, to allow for social interaction and mutual assistance in case of attacks by robbers.
>
> Each dwelling has a sacred space, called a shrine or monastery, where individuals perform their holy practices in solitude. They bring nothing into this space except religious texts, inspired sayings of prophets, hymns, and other materials that nurture knowledge and devotion. This helps them maintain a constant awareness of God, even in their dreams, where they often receive divine insights.
>
> Twice daily, at dawn and dusk, they offer prayers. In the morning, they pray for enlightenment, hoping their minds will be filled with heavenly light. In the evening, they pray for their souls to be freed from worldly desires and to reflect on truth.
>
> From dawn to sunset, they dedicate themselves to their spiritual exercises. They study sacred texts, interpreting them allegorically, believing that the literal words represent deeper, hidden meanings. They also read works by ancient authors who once led their school and left behind many examples of allegorical interpretation. Using these as models, they follow the practices of their predecessors.
>
> They do not spend all their time just in contemplation. Instead, they compose songs and hymns to God in various meters and melodies, based on solemn rhythms. For six days, each person stays in solitude in their "monastery," studying without leaving or looking outside. But on the seventh day, they gather for a general assembly. They sit in order according to their seniority, with their hands positioned thoughtfully—right hand between the chest and chin, left hand by the side.
>
> The most knowledgeable senior member speaks, discussing doctrines with steady eyes and voice, using reason and thoughtfulness. Unlike modern rhetoricians and sophists, he doesn't show off with clever words but carefully explains the deep meanings that reach the soul. Everyone listens silently, showing approval with just a look or nod.
>
> The assembly takes place in a sanctuary with two separate sections: one for men and one for women. Women also attend regularly, sharing the same eagerness and deliberate choice as the men. The division between the two halls is only partially built up, about three or four cubits from the floor, forming a kind of low wall. The rest of the space up to the roof is left open for two reasons: first, to maintain the modesty appropriate for women, and second, so they can easily hear the speaker without any obstruction.
>
> The Therapeuts prioritize self-control as the foundation of their soul and build other virtues upon it. They do not eat or drink before sundown because they believe philosophy deserves the light of day, while bodily needs can be satisfied in the darkness. Therefore, they dedicate the day to philosophical pursuits and a small part of the night to bodily needs.
>
> Some of them, who have a greater thirst for wisdom, only think about food once every three days. A few are so satisfied by the teachings of wisdom that they can go twice as long, up to six days, with just a small amount of necessary food, almost living on air like grasshoppers, whose light needs are complemented by their singing.
>
> They consider the seventh day sacred and a high festival, worthy of special honor. On this day, after attending to their souls, they care for their bodies, giving them and their cattle a break from continuous labor. They do not indulge in fancy food but eat plain bread seasoned with salt, and sometimes add hyssop for extra flavor. For drink, they have spring water. Thus, in calming the tyrants of hunger and thirst that nature has imposed on humans, they provide only the bare necessities to sustain life, avoiding anything that might feed vanity. They eat to satisfy hunger and drink to quench thirst, steering clear of overindulgence as it harms both body and soul.
>
> There are two types of coverings: clothes and houses. Their homes, as mentioned earlier, are simple and functional, built to serve only essential needs. Their clothing is also plain, designed simply to protect them from the cold and heat. In winter, they wear thick mantles instead of wool hides, and in summer, they wear sleeveless linen robes.
>
> They practice simplicity in all things, understanding that vanity is rooted in falsehood, while simplicity is rooted in truth. Falsehood leads to many evils, whereas truth brings plentiful blessings, both human and divine.
>
> I will also mention their communal gatherings, where they celebrate more festively than usual with shared meals. These gatherings contrast sharply with the extravagant and debauched banquets of others. Every seventh week, they all come together, valuing not just the seven-day week but also the period of seven times seven, recognizing the number seven as pure and ever-virgin.
>
> Their seven-day festival is just a prelude to their greatest celebration, which takes place on the fiftieth day, considered the most sacred and natural of numbers, representing the powers of the perfect right-angled triangle and the origin of the elements of the universe. When they gather, dressed in white robes with joyful expressions and great solemnity, they receive a signal from one of the day's officials (known as Ephemereuts). Before sitting down, they stand in rows, eyes and hands lifted to heaven—eyes trained to seek worthy contemplation and hands unstained by greed. They pray to God for their banquet to be pleasing and acceptable.
>
> After prayers, the elders take their seats according to their rank. Elders are not just those advanced in age, but those mature in the contemplative aspect of philosophy, its most beautiful and divine part. Women also participate, many of whom have remained virgins by choice, out of love for wisdom. They disregard bodily pleasures, longing instead for spiritual fulfillment. Their desire is not for mortal children but for an immortal legacy, which the soul in love with God can produce when inspired by divine enlightenment to understand the laws of wisdom.
>
> In their seating arrangement at the table, men and women are separated, with men on the right and women on the left. In the Greco-Roman world, it was customary to recline at the table, leaning on the left elbow with a cushion under the arm. The person reclining to the right of another was said to lie on the latter's chest.
>
> You might think that well-born, well-bred people and philosophy students would have at least somewhat soft cushions, but they only have mattresses made of easily available materials, like local papyrus, covered with the simplest rugs. These rugs are slightly raised at the elbow for support. While they do relax their usual strict lifestyle a bit during these occasions, they still practice a form of frugality, avoiding indulgence in pleasures.
>
> They are not served by slaves, as they believe owning servants is against nature. Nature created all men free, but the injustice and selfishness of those seeking inequality have imposed power over the weaker, making them serve the stronger.
>
> So, at this holy banquet, there are no slaves. Free men serve, not out of compulsion or waiting for orders, but willingly and eagerly. These servers are not just any free men but younger members of the community who have been chosen for this role. Order of merit with utmost care, who (as those noble, well-born, and keen to achieve the highest virtue should) with loving competition, as if they were their own children, attend to these fathers and mothers of theirs, viewing them as their common parents, connected by stronger bonds than those of blood: since, for those who understand, there is no stronger bond than virtue and goodness. They come to serve without belts, with their robes flowing, to avoid any resemblance to a slave's attire.
>
> I know some readers will laugh at such a banquet; but such laughter will bring them weeping and sorrow. No wine is served on these occasions, only the clearest water, cold for most, and warmed for the older men with more delicate tastes. The table contains no meat; the food is bread with salt for seasoning, with hyssop added for those who enjoy it. Just as right reason instructs priests to make offerings free from wine and blood, it also instructs these wise men to live likewise. Wine is a drug that leads to madness, and expensive seasonings stir up desire, the most insatiable of beasts.
>
> So much for the banquet preparations. Now, after the guests have taken their places as described, and the servers are ready, complete silence is maintained—(and when is it not?) You might say that there's an even deeper silence than before, so no one dares to make a sound or even breathe heavily. The president searches for a passage in the sacred scriptures or solves a problem posed by one of the members. He doesn’t do this to show off his cleverness, but because he genuinely wants to understand some points of doctrine better. Once he understands, he generously shares his insights with those who, though they may not see as clearly as he does, have just as strong a desire to learn.
>
> The president uses a somewhat leisurely method of teaching, pausing frequently to recap and reinforce the ideas. This way, the concepts are impressed upon their minds. If someone speaks too quickly without pausing, the listeners’ minds can't keep up and they fail to understand what’s being said. The listeners, in turn, pay full attention to him and stay in the same position, listening carefully. They show they understand and comprehend his words by nodding and looking at him, express their praise with pleased expressions and by turning their faces thoughtfully towards him, and show hesitation with a slight shake of the head and a motion of the forefinger of the right hand. The younger members who serve are just as attentive as the seniors at the table.
>
> The interpretation of sacred scriptures relies on understanding the deeper meanings within allegorical stories. These interpreters view their entire law-code as a living entity, with the spoken commands as its body and the hidden thoughts within the words as its soul. This hidden thought allows the rational soul of the student to contemplate things more deeply. This interpretation process involves recognizing the extraordinary beauty of the ideas within the words, stripping away symbolism to reveal the core meanings to those who can intuitively grasp the hidden sense from the obvious meaning.
>
> When the leader has spoken for a sufficient amount of time and the discourse has been adequately delivered and received, the audience shows their appreciation with three claps of the hands. Then the leader rises and chants a hymn in honor of God, which can be either a new composition of his own or an old one from ancient poets. These poets have left behind many well-structured works, including trimetric epics, processional hymns, libation odes, altar-chants, stationary choruses, and dance-songs. After the leader, others also take turns chanting in an orderly manner, while the rest of the group listens in deep silence, except when joining in on the chorus and refrains. Both men and women participate in this chanting.
>
> After the hymns are over, the juniors bring in the table with pure food: leavened bread seasoned with salt and hyssop, honoring the holy table in the temple. On this table are loaves and salt without any other seasoning; the loaves are unleavened and the salt is pure. This simple and pure food is given to the highest-ranking priests as a reward for their service, while the others strive for similar purity but abstain from the same food to honor the privilege of the priests.
>
> After the meal, they celebrate an all-night festival. Here's how it goes: They all stand up together, and about halfway through the event, they split into two groups, one for men and one for women. Each group chooses a leader, the most reputable and suitable person for the role.
>
> They then chant hymns in God's honor with various rhythms and melodies, sometimes singing in chorus, sometimes one group responding to the other, dancing to the music, and inspiring each other with processional and standing songs, turning and returning in the dance. After each group has sung and danced separately, drinking a divine nectar like in Bacchic rites where men drink unmixed wine, they join together into one chorus, imitating the chorus on the banks of the Red Sea, celebrating the miraculous works of God. The sea, by God's command, became a source of safety for one group and destruction for the other.

Philo refers to the legendary dance of triumph by the Israelites after Pharaoh and his army were destroyed, where Moses led the men and Miriam led the women in a shared dance. However, the Therapeuts worldwide could not have linked their customs to this myth.

> The chorus of men and women Therapeuts, modeled as closely as possible on this example, creates a harmonious and musical symphony through melodies in parts. The women's high notes complement the men's deep tones. The ideas, expressions, and dancers are all beautiful and reverent, aiming for piety.
>
> With this uplifting experience, they remain alert and refreshed even until morning, without feeling tired or heavy-headed. At dawn, they stand and, upon seeing the rising sun, raise their hands to heaven, praying for light, truth, and spiritual clarity. After this prayer, each person returns to their sanctuary to engage in philosophical pursuits and related work.
>
> Thus, the Therapeuts, who are dedicated to contemplating nature and living in harmony with their souls, are considered citizens of both heaven and earth. They are legitimately recommended to the Father and Creator of the Universe by their virtue, which earns them His love. This virtue aims for the highest reward of nobility and goodness, surpassing all material gifts and leading them to ultimate blessedness.

Regarding the mystic numbers 7 and 50 mentioned previously, it’s interesting to note that Philo also states elsewhere (Leg. Alleg., i. 46) that the Pythagoreans called the number 7 the "ever-virgin" because it neither produces nor is produced by any of the numbers within the decad (from 1 to 10). The square of 7 is 49, and the great feast occurred every fiftieth day. The number 50 is related to the proportions of the "perfect" right-angled triangle, also known as the Pythagorean triangle, often mentioned by Plato. The sides of this triangle have proportions of 3, 4, and 5, and 3² + 4² = 5², or 9 + 16 = 25; and 9 + 16 + 25 = 50.

In another work (Qu. in Gen., iii. 39), Philo provides more information about the number 50. He mentions two series of numbers, which he calls triangles and squares: 1, 3, 6, 10, and 1, 4, 9, 16. Initially, it's unclear why Philo calls the first series triangles, but it seems he had a specific arrangement in mind. Many interesting patterns can be found in these sequences, but here we focus on the number 50.

In the triangular series 1, 3, 6, 10:
- 1 = 1
- 3 = 1 + 2
- 6 = 1 + 2 + 3
- 10 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4

In the square series 1, 4, 9, 16:
- 1 = 1²
- 4 = 2²
- 9 = 3²
- 16 = 4²

Additionally, 1 + 3 + 6 + 10 = 20; and 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30; and finally, 20 + 30 = 50.

There is much more to explore, but space is limited. Those interested can delve into the details themselves. When reading this treatise and other references to the Therapeuts in Philo's writings, key questions arise: What was Philo's connection with them, and how reliable is his account?

An important passage in his writings provides a critical starting point for seeking answers. "I have often left my family, friends, and homeland to seek solitude and understand important truths, but I gained nothing. My soul was restless and filled with passion, leading me away from my goal." This personal account shows that Philo was unsuccessful in his contemplative pursuits. This failure made him greatly admire those who succeeded in understanding profound truths.

Since Philo never gave up his property, he likely wasn't a full member of the brotherhoods he admired, but rather part of an outer circle. Similar to the Pythagoreans and Essenes, the Therapeuts had lay followers who lived in the world but occasionally joined the community for retreats before returning to their everyday lives. These lay disciples were very talented and insightful, as evidenced by Philo's own works. However, Philo also mentions a greater body of literature, now lost, that included commentaries, hymns, sermons, and apocalypses, which he highly regarded. Some fragments of this literature might be found in the Jewish Pseudepigrapha, but many likely preceded the surviving Gnostic texts.

Philo suggests that the Therapeuts were Jews, but his descriptions indicate that their community was just one of many spread across the world. Philo wants us to believe that his community was the most important, likely because it was mainly Jewish, although not traditionally so, as they were "sun-worshippers." This suggests that at the time, there were many communities of mystics and ascetics living holy lives and studying sacred science scattered around the world, and Philo's Mareotic community was one of them.

Other communities might have been influenced by Babylonian, Chaldaean, Zoroastrian, or Orphic traditions, just as the one near Alexandria was influenced by Judaism. It is also plausible that some truly eclectic communities combined and synthesized various traditions and teachings from these more exclusive communities. We should look to these eclectic communities for insights into the origins of Gnosticism and the mystical background of Christianity.

These communities did not actively seek converts, though they may have indirectly influenced significant missionary efforts, such as Philo’s. I also believe that the later Gnostic communities did not directly seek converts and that any works aimed at laypeople were only a small part of their literature. For the general populace, there were the Law, the Prophets, and the Gospel; for lay pupils, there was intermediate literature; and for the initiated, there were highly mystical and complex treatises that only trained mystics could understand or were expected to understand.

### The Jewish Tradition

The third significant influence on the origins of Christianity came from Jewish tradition. Even before the Exile, the various tribes of this unique nation had their "Schools of the Prophets," small communities set apart and composed of seers and visionaries. Up until this time, Jewish traditions and religious ideas were quite basic compared to the more advanced civilizations around them. However, they were notable for their emerging monotheism and increasing rejection of idolatry.

In Babylon, the Jews encountered a sophisticated and ancient culture, which significantly influenced their religious development. Most Jews stayed in Babylon, while the leaders who returned to their homeland began to rewrite their traditions and reformulate their religious ideas, incorporating the broader perspectives they had gained. This transformation is evident in the evolution of their scriptures, as revealed by scholarly research and archaeological discoveries.

Jewish writers adopted the traditions of the great Semitic race and the cultures of Chaldea and Babylon, using them to glorify their own origins and history, believing these traditions applied to them as God's "chosen people." They also embraced the Persian Zoroastrian emphasis on purity, which influenced their priesthood. This led to the gradual removal of primitive ideas about God and the development of more refined and poetic concepts in their religious texts.

It's important to understand that the rewriters and editors of these old traditions were not forgers or falsifiers in the modern sense. In antiquity, there was no concept of literary morality as we understand it today, and religious writings were driven by inner inspiration. Modern Biblical critics often use a wealth of technical terms to describe ancient writers and their methods, which can unintentionally lead students to impose modern ideas and standards onto those times.

A common mistake is to attribute to these ancient Jewish figures motives and beliefs that belong to the best in Christendom, thereby misrepresenting their true nature and creating an overly refined image of their historical context. It's important to remember that mixing mythology with history was common in those times, not just among the Jews. What set the Jews apart was their intense belief in being God's chosen people and their claim to exclusive divine providence.

The Jews, like all desert dwellers, had a deep longing for freedom and a natural poetic imagination from living close to nature. The two kingdoms, "Israel" and "Judah," were always fighting among themselves and with their neighbors. To eliminate this source of constant trouble, the Assyrian authorities deported them. The "ten tribes" of Israel were deported first and, being more adaptable than the Judaeans, settled in Babylonia and gradually blended into their new environment.

It would be fascinating to learn about the developments in their prophetic schools influenced by ancient Chaldaean wisdom and the subsequent history of that "Israel" which not only settled in Babylon but stayed there. When the more unruly Judaean tribes were later deported, some followed the example of their relatives; however, most Judaeans resisted adapting to the new conditions. They longed for their freedom and, despite being surrounded by the monuments of a great civilization, yearned for their humble settlement of Jerusalem as if it were paradise and its modest homes the palaces of kings.

The elders told their children stories of the beauty and richness of their homeland, the splendor of its palaces, and the great deeds of their ancient leaders. They emphasized their unique destiny as a people who had a covenant with a God who promised them victory over all enemies. Over time, the elders began to believe their own tales and passed away before the conqueror Cyrus, grateful for their aid against the Assyrian power, allowed the Judaeans to return.

The next generation returned to the ruins of Jerusalem with grand ideas of a past greatness that existed more in the poetic imagination and love of freedom of their ancestors than in actual history. Enthusiastic about the past, they wrote down what their fathers had told them, transforming old records into a grand "history" that included all the religious developments from their debates with the Babylonians and Persians. These debates involved persistently claiming that their religion was superior, adopting the best aspects of their opponents' traditions as their own, and asserting they had something even greater. The Jews had such a strong belief that they were God's Chosen People that they probably believed all their claims.

In any case, a sense of historical accuracy did not exist in those days, and there was no one to challenge the enthusiasm of these early writers. They likely argued: We are God's chosen people, our religion is superior to all others, and all other gods and religions are false. The golden age of our religion was before the Captivity; those times were greater than the best times in other nations. Our temple must have been more magnificent, and our sacrifices greater than any other in the world; our ancestors have said this, and we believe it to be true. With this mindset and their natural poetic passion,

they felt driven to write. Through their writing, they transformed the old records beyond historical recognition, gradually creating a literature that future generations accepted without question, not only as an accurate record of facts but as divinely inspired scripture. The development of this literature was a natural process, though the distinct elements involved are somewhat difficult to separate. However, there are clear signs of repeated modifications of earlier, simpler ideas and a growing spiritual influence on the nation.

Where did this persistent spiritualization of old ideas come from? To answer this question, we can note that the majority of the nation did not return from captivity. Additionally, over time, most Jews preferred to live among non-Jews. They gradually became the great traders of the ancient world, establishing colonies in all major centers. For example, shortly after Alexandria was founded, a colony of no fewer than 40,000 Jews settled there. These Jews of the Diaspora were in constant contact with their Palestinian co-religionists and were also closely connected with the great civilizations in which they lived.

The Jews adopted the belief in a savior and the salvation of their people from Zoroastrianism, adapting it to their own needs and the belief that Israel was God's Chosen People. Initially, this expectation was entirely material; they hoped for a king who would restore their freedom, defeat the nations of the world, and reign for a thousand years in Jerusalem, all through the direct intervention of Yahweh, their God.

For about four hundred years, up until the final destruction of Jerusalem by Titus, the Jews engaged in a relentless struggle for freedom. Despite repeated disappointments and subjugation by Greece and Rome, their hope persisted. Their literature reflects a determined opposition to their conquerors, fueled by passionate and often extreme exhortations and prophecies, unmatched in history. While the Greek genius focused on intellectual freedom, the Jewish nation centered on personal freedom. After Jerusalem's destruction, the Roman Empire saw Jewry as a hub of discontent and revolutionary ideas. This was driven by the Jews' uniquely exclusive faith, which Romans viewed as hatred of mankind.

However, this fanatical zeal, fed by the more extreme religious writings and prophets, became increasingly disliked by the more reasonable elements of the nation. Spiritual perspectives gradually integrated into sacred literature, and Pharisaism slowly influenced the nation. Although Pharisaism focused on strict ceremonial practices and rules of external purity, it significantly broadened religious understanding. While the external practices of Pharisaism are well-documented, the deeper, more spiritual aspects of this movement, which included the most learned Jews, are less understood. Over time, Pharisaism split into various schools, with the strictest adhering to a life of internal purity. This led to more spiritual ideas, as Pharisaism was influenced by Babylonian and Persian traditions.

Through this tradition, a more spiritual view of the Messiah emerged: Israel was seen not as a physical nation but as God's chosen people from all nations. Servants of God were those who served with their hearts, not just their lips, and God rejected blood sacrifices. However, these views, while influencing public scripture, couldn't be openly declared among a people who often rejected their prophets and valued blood sacrifices.

Therefore, such ideas were discussed privately, and there are records of schools of Chassidim and Essenes, described by Josephus, where the most pure and learned Jews, the "Rabbis of the South," lived in seclusion. These communities maintained the strict physical discipline of the Schools of the Prophets and engaged with the spiritual ideas of Babylonian wisdom.

In Babylon, a seer connected with Chaldaean wisdom, and the "Vision of Ezekiel" became a canonical reference for ideas later revived in Medieval Kabbalism. To understand the studies and inner experiences of the mystic schools of Chassidim and their followers, one must be familiar with non-canonical Jewish writings, especially wisdom literature, apocrypha, apocalypses, and apologies for unfulfilled prophecy. These texts, largely pseudepigraphal (falesly or wrongly attributed), were produced in the centuries before and after our era. Although we only have fragments of this extensive literature, likely the works intended for broad circulation and written by those still holding the Zealot view of Israel, they help us understand the background of Gnosis and how earnestly people sought a purer life and deeper knowledge of God.

These Jewish mystic schools significantly influenced early Christianity. The innermost schools affected the inner schools of Christendom, while the broader literature left a lasting impact on general Christianity. When these mystic schools and communities—whether Greek, Egyptian, or Jewish—interacted, they exchanged ideas and influences.

Some individuals refused to mix their personal beliefs or doctrines with others, and there were very conservative mystic groups in all three traditions. However, some members, if not officially, at least personally, exchanged ideas and expanded their perspectives. In the two centuries before and the two centuries after the start of our era, there was a great enthusiasm for combining different beliefs among members of these groups. This enthusiasm is evident in the fragments of Gnostic texts preserved by later orthodox critics.

### Alexandria

The rough outline of the background of Gnosticism we've tried to describe is necessarily vague, as each of the many subjects touched upon could fill multiple volumes. Our goal has been to give a general idea of the diverse origins of Gnosticism. But since our outline is so broad, it might be helpful, before going further, to give readers an idea of the immediate external conditions in which Christian Gnosticism existed and eventually disappeared. Emphasizing some points already mentioned and adding a few more details may make things clearer.

The best place to start this observation is Alexandria, and the best time is when mainstream Christianity had triumphed and driven Gnosticism underground. It should be noted that this sketch will only describe the external appearances; within, as we have suggested and will show later, there was a hidden life full of activity.

If there was a large public library in Alexandria, there were also many private libraries within inner circles that studied sacred and mystical subjects. It was from these private circles that all mystical writings originated. The nature of Gnostic and other similar works that have survived shows that their authors had access to extensive collections of mystical knowledge.

Now, let us imagine the last quarter of the fourth century, when Hypatia was a young girl. This was after the School, which traced its roots back through Plato and Pythagoras to Orpheus, had suffered a severe setback due to the early death of the philosopher-emperor Julian. At that time, the Serapeum was still standing, untouched by the destructive hands of zealots whose fanaticism stemmed from Jewish Zealotism and was entirely foreign to Christ's teachings.

Let us climb the great lighthouse, 400 feet high, on the island off the mainland, known as the world-famous Pharos, and take a bird's-eye view of the intellectual center of the ancient Western world. The city stretches out before us on a long strip of land between the sea and Lake Mareotis to the south. Far to the left is the westernmost mouth of the Nile, called the Canopic, and a large canal leads to Canopus, where the sacred shrine of Serapis is located. During festival times, you would see crowds of pilgrims traveling on brightly decorated barges to pay their respects to certain wise priests, one of whom, around this time, was a distinguished member of the later Platonic School.

The great city with its bustling population stretches out before us along a coastline of about four or five miles. It is shaped like an oblong scarf, twice as long as it is wide. This shape dates back to 331 B.C. when Alexander the Great marked out the city's original walls using flour carried by his Macedonian soldiers, possibly following a local custom. The city is divided into four quarters by two main streets that form a cross. These streets are much wider than our modern streets, and the longer one runs parallel to the shore, extending through the suburbs for three leagues (9 miles; 14.48 kilometers). The Alexandrians consider it quite a journey to cross their city.

At the intersection of these streets is a large square surrounded by beautiful buildings and decorated with fountains, statues, and trees. There are many other squares and forums, but none as large as this main square. The city features many pillars and obelisks, the most notable being a flat-topped red stone pillar on a hill near the shore, and two obelisks on the shore itself, one of which is now known as Cleopatra's Needle.

The island we are on is connected to the mainland by a massive causeway almost a mile long, with two waterways spanned by bridges and defended by towers. This causeway helps form the main harbor on our right and a smaller, less safe harbor on our left. There is also a third large dock or basin in the northwest quarter of the city, also closed off by a bridge.

Alexandria is divided into four quarters by its two main streets, and these quarters, along with the city's first suburb, were originally named after the first five letters of the alphabet. The large quarter on our left is commonly known as the Bruchion, likely named after the palace that Ptolemy Soter set aside to start the great library.

The Greek quarter is the most fashionable and architecturally magnificent area. Here, you can see the vast mausoleum of Alexander the Great, which contains the golden coffin preserving the body of the world-conquering hero for hundreds of years. Also present are the splendid tombs of the Ptolemies, who ruled Egypt from the division of Alexander's empire until the Romans took the kingdom from Cleopatra in the late first century B.C.

Next, observe the great temple of Poseidon, the sea god, a favorite deity among sailors. There is also the Museum, the university's center, with all its lecture rooms and halls; it is a later building, not the original Museum of the Ptolemies. You’ll find baths everywhere, magnificent buildings where the luxurious Alexandrians spend much of their time.

To the right is the Egyptian quarter, the northwestern part called Rhacotis, an ancient name from a time before Alexandria existed, when an old Egyptian town called Ragadouah was there. The difference in architectural style strikes you immediately, as it is mostly in the more somber Egyptian style.

The large building you see in the eastern part of the quarter is the famous Serapeum. It is not just a single building but a group of buildings, with the temple being the main one. It is a fortress-like place with plain, heavy walls, older than the Greek buildings, gloomy and severe, suited to the Egyptian character. It is the center of the "Heathen" schools, meaning the Barbarian or non-Greek lecture halls. You will always remember the Serapeum for its vast flights of steps bordered by numerous sphinxes, both inside and outside the great gate.

If you could see beneath the buildings, you would be amazed by the network of vaults and crypts that the whole city seems to be built on. These vaults are mostly used as underground cisterns for storing water, which is very important in a country like Egypt that gets so little rain. The southeastern quarter, behind the Bruchion, is the center of the Jewish community, which has been there since the days of Alexander the Great, and has always had at least 40,000 Jews. The large open space to the left of the Bruchion is the Hippodrome or racecourse, and further east along the shore is the fashionable suburb of Nicopolis, where Hypatia might live. On the other side of the city, beyond Rhacotis, is a huge cemetery filled with countless statues and columns, known as Necropolis.

The different styles of architecture and distinct characteristics of the various quarters give only a small idea of the mixed and diverse population gathered at the place where Europe, Asia, and Africa meet. First, you have the upper-class Egyptians and Greeks, who are mostly very refined, proud, and delicate. There are only a few Romans—the magistrates and military, the legionaries of the guard who patrol the city and stop the frequent riots of religious disputants. They have a blunt and impartial contempt for all, whether Jew or Christian, Gnostic or Heathen.

In the more menial jobs, you see the lower-class mixed Egyptians, likely descendants of the original inhabitants, in large numbers. There are also thousands of Ethiopians and Africans in the brightest colors. You also see groups of monks from the Thebaid, many from the Nitrian Valley, a two or three days' journey south into the desert, beyond the great lake. They are easily recognizable with their tangled, unkempt hair and animal skins for clothing. Most of them are a violent, ignorant, and uncontrollable group of fanatics. Among them are people dressed in black, including church officials, deacons, and other Christian church officers.

Down by the harbors, however, we encounter many other types, often hard to tell apart due to their mingling and mixing. Thousands of them come and go on the small ships that crowd the harbors in fleets. Many are connected to the once-great nation of the "Hittites," along with numerous Phoenician and Carthaginian sailors, and traders from far-off ports. There are Jews everywhere in the trading areas, and people who resemble Afghans; also, ascetics from Syria, possibly descendants of the Essenes or Therapeutae, who pay great attention to cleanliness. Additionally, there are a few tall, golden-haired people, possibly Goths and Teutons, who look down on the others, considering them weak and effeminate—big, tall, strong, rough individuals. A few Persians and other distant Orientals are present too.

However, you might be more interested in the Christian populace, a very mixed group both outwardly and inwardly. The city church officials are more involved in politics than religion; the rest of the faithful can be divided into two main groups, each showing a very different form of Christianity. On one hand, the lower classes and many monks are bigoted and ignorant, looking down on all education, devoted to the cult of martyrs, eager for the blood of Jews, and desperate to destroy every statue and temple. On the other hand, there is a group of refined debaters, philosophical theologians, always arguing, eager to debate with Pagan philosophers, spending their lives in public discussions. The crowds that gather to listen are mostly indifferent to who is right or wrong, and they applaud every debating point with impartiality, enjoying the arguments from a perspective of refined skepticism.

Let's continue quickly with our task and finish our description of the city by briefly mentioning two of its most famous institutions: the Library and the Museum. Even if most of us are unfamiliar with Alexandria's layout and know nothing about its schools' history, we have all heard of its world-renowned Library. When Alexander's empire was divided among his generals, the wealthy kingdom of Egypt went to Ptolemy I, known as Soter, the Saviour. He believed that Greek culture was the most civilizing force in the world and that Greek methods were the most enlightened.

Soter aimed to create a small Greece in Egypt and make his court in Alexandria a center for all Greek learning. With this noble ambition, he founded a Museum or University dedicated to the arts and sciences, and also a Library. Aristotle, the philosopher who taught Alexander the art of governance, inspired Soter to gather all works on this useful science. Fortunately, the initial idea of a purely political library was quickly abandoned in favor of a more universal approach.

It is possible that Ptolemy, as an Egyptian ruler, merely established a new library for his capital in competition with the many existing libraries in Egypt. We only need to recall the vast collection of Osymandyas at Thebes, known as the "Remedy of the Soul," to be convinced of this. Therefore, while the Alexandrian Library was the first major public Greek library, it was by no means the first in Egypt. Nor was it the first library in Greece; Polycrates of Samos, Pisistratus and Eucleides of Athens, Nicocrates of Cyprus, Euripides the poet, and Aristotle himself all had large book collections.

In summary, the first collection of books was placed near the Canopic Gate in the royal palaces, specifically in the Bruchion area close to the Museum. A librarian and a large staff, including copyists, calligraphers, scholars, and cataloguers, were appointed. The scholars revised and corrected the texts, and experts selected the best editions. Under the first Ptolemies, collecting books became an obsession. Ptolemy Soter sent letters to all reigning sovereigns, requesting copies of all their works, including those of poets, historians, and others. Ptolemy II (Philadelphus) commissioned ship captains to bring manuscripts, paying so generously that it encouraged forgeries.

Attalus and Eumenes, kings of Pergamum in Asia Minor, established a rival library and searched for books so fervently that Aristotle’s library had to be buried to prevent it from being taken, although it eventually ended up in Alexandria. Philadelphus then banned the export of papyrus from Egypt, forcing Pergamum to use vellum, which is where the term "parchment" comes from.

Manuscript trade flourished throughout Greece, especially in Rhodes and Athens. Consequently, Alexandria acquired the oldest manuscripts of Homer, Hesiod, Plato, Aristotle, and many other significant works. Additionally, numerous translators were employed to translate foreign books into Greek. The sacred books of various nations were translated, and the Septuagint version of the Hebrew Bible was included among them, reportedly through a miracle, according to the legend told by Josephus. By the reign of Ptolemy III (Euergetes), the Bruchion library could no longer hold all the books. So, a new collection was started in the buildings of the Serapeum on the other side of the city, though not in the main temple with its four hundred pillars.

Today, only Pompey's Pillar remains from that era. The library grew rapidly, and by the times of the first three Ptolemies, it is said to have housed 400,000 rolls or volumes. Later estimates suggest the number might have exceeded a million. However, it's important to note that a "book" or "roll" back then was often just a chapter of a larger work. Some authors are said to have written "six thousand books" because each roll was relatively small for convenience, and a single work could consist of many rolls. Therefore, we should be cautious not to overestimate the size of the great Library.

The Serapeum soon held as many books as the Bruchion, but in 47 B.C., a great fire that destroyed Caesar's fleet also burned the Bruchion to the ground. Lucian, a poet, claimed the fire's glow could be seen as far away as Rome! The Bruchion was rebuilt, and the famous library of Pergamus, which the city had given to the Senate and which Mark Antony gifted to Cleopatra, was added to it.

When Alexandria began to decline, its library did too. Emperor Julian (360-363) took many volumes to enrich his own library. In 387, "Christian" fanatics stormed the Serapeum, destroyed the temple, and left nothing of the library but empty shelves. In 641, Amru, a general under Omar, the second leader after the Prophet, fueled the furnaces of Alexandria's 4,000 baths for six months using the priceless treasures of the Bruchion. If the contents of the scrolls were in the Koran, they were deemed unnecessary; if not, they were considered dangerous. In either case, they were burned.

Some modern Muslim apologists have tried to deny this story, but Omar may be just as inexcusable as the "Christian" barbarians who destroyed the Serapeum's library. This was the material that the scholars, scientists, and philosophers of Alexandria worked with. Additionally, there was a sort of university called the Museum, dedicated to the arts and sciences. It included an observatory, an anatomy amphitheater, a vast botanical garden, an immense menagerie, and many other collections useful for physical research.

The institution was conceived on a very liberal plan, housing an assembly of scholars in a palace, richly endowed by generous princes and exempt from public duties. There were no distinctions of race or creed, no imposed regulations, no set study plans or lecture lists. The members of this esteemed assembly were free to pursue their research and studies without restrictions. Among them were countless poets, historians, geometers, mathematicians, astronomers, translators, critics, commentators, physicians, natural scientists, philologists, grammarians, archaeologists—in short, scholars of all kinds laying the foundations of research that, after centuries, have once again captured the world's attention.

Indeed, the Museum of Alexandria took hesitant steps where we now proceed with confidence. However, the spirit and method were the same, though weaker compared to our current strength, now revitalized. The mindset of the last three centuries before the Christian era was very similar to that of the past three centuries in our time. Religion had lost its influence on the educated; skepticism, "science," and misunderstood Aristotelian philosophy were considered the only pursuits worthy of a genius. There were also "emancipated women" and "dialectical daughters," common in those later days of Greece.

These scholars believed that their great founder, Alexander, had conquered the political world by following the advice of his teacher, Aristotle. They aspired to follow the teachings of Aristotle, who had mapped out the heavens and the earth, believing they too would conquer the remaining natural and intellectual world. It seemed so probable and logical then, and it still seems probable to some minds today. So, they engaged in commenting, criticizing, philology, grammar, accentuation, categorizing, and cataloguing. They aimed to measure things; as students of Euclid, they tried to measure the distance from the earth to the sun.

Eratosthenes, using copper armillae or circles to determine the equinox, calculated the tilt of the earth's axis and the circumference of the earth from travel and geographic knowledge in the great Library. In mechanics, Archimedes solved the principles of the lever and hydrostatics, which are the foundations of our modern statics and hydrostatics. Hipparchus also developed a theory of the heavens, which, although flawed in some respects, was accurate enough to predict eclipses and other phenomena. Three hundred years later, under the Antonines, a scholar named Ptolemy, who was more of a commentator than an original thinker, updated this theory and claimed it as his own. Hipparchus is also credited with founding plane and spherical trigonometry. However, it is not necessary to delve into the long list of other notable figures from that era, such as encyclopedists and grammarians like Callimachus and Aristophanes, or poets like Theocritus.

With the destruction of the original Museum in the fire of Caesar's fleet and the subsequent Roman conquest, the first Museum came to an end. Although a new Museum was established during the reign of Emperor Claudius (41-50 A.D.), it was only a shadow of its former self. It served more as an official venue for the emperor's tedious writings rather than a true center of learning. Claudius had written eight books on the history of Carthage and twenty books on the history of Etruria in Greek, which Suetonius described as more clumsy than elegant. He established the new Museum so that his writings could be read to flattering scholars at least once a year.

Thus, the glory of that center of scholarship and science faded away. It was a soulless institution, symbolic of a period of disbelief and skepticism, destined to disappear once humanity rediscovered its sense of purpose. As for the external schools of so-called philosophy during that time, they too were unproductive. The great Greek philosophers like Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle were long gone, and their successors were mostly involved in trivial debates and rhetoric. Dialectic arguers of the Megaran school, Eristics or debaters, Pyrrhonists or skeptics, Cyrenaics who believed that the senses are the only source of knowledge, pessimists and nihilists, and a host of later skeptics, Cynics, Epicureans, Academics, Peripatetics, and Stoics—Epicureans who sought a comfortable life; Stoics who, contrary to Plato's doctrine of social virtues, valued individual dignity.

After the three great reigns of the first Ptolemies, Alexandria, along with its rulers, declined morally. For one hundred and eighty years, "sophists argued, and scholars quarreled over accents and readings with true hostility," until Cleopatra, like Helen, betrayed her country to the Romans, making Egypt a Roman province. Up to this point, there was no true philosophy in Alexandria; it was not part of the Museum's curriculum. Alexandria had not developed its own philosophy, but now it was destined to become the place where all kinds of philosophical thought would merge. Not only philosophy but also religio-philosophy and theosophy of various kinds would be mixed, producing many strange systems and some remarkable truths.

Until now, Greek intellectuals had only shared their methods and views with the East. They had moved through Egypt, Syria, Persia, and even India, showcasing their ideas. It took many years for the Greeks to realize that the era of world-genius was not limited to the period between Homer and Aristotle. Gradually, it dawned on them that there were ancient cultures in the world that made them seem relatively new.

The Greeks may look down on the Orientals and call them mere "barbarians" because they don't speak Greek, but the so-called barbarians have the last laugh. They possess a carefully preserved wisdom that they haven't completely forgotten. The Greeks once had this tradition too and even revived it, but they have forgotten it again. Skeptics have replaced Orpheus with Homer, and Pythagoras and the real Plato with Aristotle. Their Mysteries are now mostly symbolic and no longer genuine, except for a very few.

If the Greeks looked down on the barbarians, the barbarians also had little regard for the Greeks. "You Greeks are but children, O Solon," said the wise priest of Sais to the Greek lawmaker. The Greeks misunderstood and altered the sacred myths they adopted, being fickle, careless, and superficial in religious matters. This was the ancient barbarian's critique of the young and innovative Greeks.

Slowly but surely, the wisdom of the Egyptians, Babylonians, Chaldeans, and some Jewish scholars, as well as that of Persia and perhaps India, begins to influence Greek thought. Religion and the great questions of human existence start to replace mere scholasticism, fine arts, and literature in the schools. Alexandria will no longer be just a literary city but a city of true philosophy, seeking wisdom. Though it may not fully succeed, it will strive to do so.

There will also be a new method. The hidden and concealed truths of many centuries will be discussed and analyzed. There will be a mix and combination of diverse elements, creating a patchwork of ideas. People will compare and find connections between different concepts, trying to discover a universal religion that reconciles science, philosophy, and religion into a theosophy.

However, these efforts will likely fail because humanity is nearing its end, searching for truth with an old brain full of ingrained habits and prejudices. The current race will die out, and the souls will reincarnate when the time is right. A new race with fresh vigor will emerge, but its mind will not be able to understand the problems of its predecessors. Groups like the Goths, Teutons, Vandals, Huns, Celts, Britons, and Arabs were less developed souls. The new race will grow and develop, eventually surpassing its predecessor in every way, but it will also think like a child when young, and like an adult when mature.

What could the barbaric Huns, Goths, and Arabs have made of the complex problems faced by the highly civilized Alexandrians? Therefore, the new race will need a new religion suited to its needs, character, and age. Its historical origins remain unclear, and the true history of its Founder is impossible to discover. However, it is certain that a new tone was set for the development of this new instrument.

It's always risky to generalize too much and depict the past in overly dramatic colors. In human affairs, nothing is purely good or bad; the old ways had both good and evil, just as the new ways do. The new method aimed to reveal some of the sacred Mysteries and secret teachings to everyone. Followers of the new religion claimed to disclose "everything," and many believed it had unveiled all that could be known. This was because they were still naïve.

The light seemed so brilliant to them that they believed it came directly from the supreme God. They abandoned the old gods, who were quickly turned into devils. The general public began to experiment with psychic and spiritual forces, formerly restricted to the Mysteries, and went mad for a while, and they still haven't fully regained their sanity. Let's consider this fascinating phenomenon for a moment.

In the Roman Empire, which had unified many ancient civilizations and barbaric cultures, things were in a dire state, morally and socially. The old order was coming to an end. Political freedom and independence were gone, but intellectual and religious tolerance still existed, as ancient societies didn't understand intolerance. States were politically controlled by the Caesars, but their religious institutions, which were essential for social life and national identity, remained completely free. However, the true spirit had long departed from these ancient institutions. They were maintained for statecraft and because people needed a cult, festivals, and religious events, just as they do now. But few took these matters seriously anymore.

For the educated, there was philosophy and the influence of ancient Mysteries. But these were not for the common people or the uneducated; the priests had forgotten their duties. They used their knowledge for personal gain and had almost forgotten what they once knew. It's an old story. The ancient church was corrupt, and the ancient state was oppressive. There had to be a protest, partly right and partly wrong, as usual with good and evil both protesting against each other.

It is true that the Mysteries are open to all who are worthy. It is true that morals and virtues are essential prerequisites, but not the only ones. It is true that there is one God, but Yahweh is not that deity. It is true that there are beings and intelligences between the Supreme and man, but the gods are not man-made or devils, and angels are creatures of light. It is true that philosophy alone cannot solve the problem, but it should not be ignored. It is true that all men will be saved, but not necessarily the poor over the rich, or the ignorant over the educated.

In religious protestantism, there is no middle ground among the uninformed. They tend to go to extremes. Therefore, when a new impulse grips the people, we will see old barriers breaking down and efforts to establish a new order. However, this will come with wild intolerance, glorification of ignorance, and sweeping condemnations; a social upheaval followed by political triumph. One definite gain is a renewed faith. It was good for people to believe wholeheartedly after so much disbelief; it was good for them to prioritize virtue as the first essential step to knowing God. It was good to set aside bodily concerns and focus on the soul; it was good to bring genuine life back into people's hearts.

Who can say what might have happened if more moderate advice had been followed? The key point is that one era was ending and another beginning. The memories of the past filled the old mind, but the new mind could only understand them in simpler forms. The memory that stood out most clearly to the new mind was likely the one best suited for the strong and warlike races that would replace the old Roman Empire; this memory was the tradition of the Jews.

We are only examining the surface of the great movement that transformed the religious consciousness of the ancient world. Inside, there was much of great value, but only a part of it could be understood by the new, young mind. However, as the new race matures, it will recall more of this value; it has already remembered science and philosophy, and it will likely soon remember religion as well.

We are still looking at the external conditions in which the Gnosis was operating. In Alexandria, ever since its founding, Jews had been a significant part of the city's life. Although the translation of the Hebrew scriptures by the so-called "Seventy" began during the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus, it did not seem to catch the attention of the Greek scholars. At that time, Jewish ideas in Alexandria were limited to Jews because these exclusive and intolerant religionists kept their beliefs to themselves, guarding them from non-Jews. Later, the Jewish schools in Alexandria were so highly regarded by Jews throughout the East that the Alexandrian Rabbis were known as the "Light of Israel," continuing to be the center of Jewish thought and learning for several centuries.

In these areas, the Jews developed their religious theories and integrated knowledge from the Chaldaeans and Babylonians, as well as wisdom traditions from Egypt. Many Hebrew scholars also studied Greek philosophy and literature, becoming known as Hellenists. Some even wrote in Greek, which allowed the Greek world to learn about Jewish traditions. Aristobulus, who likely lived around 150 B.C., tried to claim that Peripatetic philosophy originated from Moses—a theory that later evolved and gained popularity, even among enlightened Church Fathers like Clement of Alexandria and Origen, but replaced Aristotle with Plato. This idea was a precursor to an even more extreme theory by Justin Martyr, who suggested that ancient wisdom was a preemptive plagiarism by the Devil to undermine the new religion. This notion has been echoed by Christian apologists almost until today.

Philo (circa 25 B.C.–45 A.D.) is the most famous Hellenist. A great admirer of Plato, his work highlights many similarities between Jewish religious thought and Greek philosophy. Although Philo's method of interpreting Jewish myths allegorically to find high philosophical meanings is no longer widely accepted, his writings remain valuable. Philo believed that the Old Testament documents were divinely inspired in every detail and that every name in them held a profound hidden meaning. This approach helped him to reinterpret and explain the literal narratives' more simplistic elements.

Although Philo's method of using "Moses" to support his school's ideas is not scientifically acceptable when the Bible is examined through historical and linguistic analysis, his many writings are still very important. They provide a record of the ideas prevalent in the groups Philo interacted with. These writings give us valuable insight into communities that thought like Philo and help us understand Jewish Gnosis in a form meant to spread those ideas. Josephus (A.D. 37-100), the well-known historian, also wrote in Greek, spreading knowledge of his nation throughout the Graeco-Roman world. This highlights the direct connections between Greek and Jewish thought aimed at spreading their beliefs.

Christianity, in its early days, was closely tied to traditional Jewish religious practices, which were free from philosophy or mystical interpretations like the Kabbalah. Gentiles who joined the new faith soon grew uncomfortable with the requirement of circumcision, insisted upon by the earliest missionaries. This led to the first division, with the "Church of Jerusalem" becoming a narrow sect, even for those who saw Judaism as the precursor to Christianity.

Over time, as more educated individuals joined or as the Christians had to defend their beliefs against educated critics, broader and more liberal views emerged within the Christian community. These views incorporated elements from other major religious traditions and philosophies. However, such views were often met with suspicion by the "orthodox," or those who eventually established what became the official doctrine.

As time passed, even the moderate liberal views of Clemens and Origen were seen as a serious threat. With the victory of strict orthodoxy and the rejection of learning, Origen was eventually condemned. The Alexandrian school of Christian philosophy, led by notable figures like Clemens and Origen, laid the groundwork for general Christian theology. This school's development was influenced by Greek thought.

There's an interesting story about its early days. Towards the end of the first century, Christians founded a school in Alexandria, a city known for its educational institutions. This was a Sunday school for children called the Didascaleion. It was established with great faith, right next to the world-famous Museum, from which general Christians were barred due to their lack of knowledge in art, science, and philosophy. However, this Sunday school eventually gave rise to the vast structure of Catholic theology. The teachers at the Didascaleion had to prove their worth and soon included many who were educated in Greek schools of thought.

This is a brief overview of Alexandria and its schools. It was in this dynamic environment of diverse ideas that some of the greatest Gnostic scholars thrived. They were also found in places like Syria, Asia Minor, Italy, Gaul, and Spain. However, the best representation of the ancient world they interacted with can be seen in Alexandria, where cultures from Egypt, Africa, Rome, Greece, Syria, and Arabia converged.

### General and Gnostic Christianity

#### The Evolution of Catholic Christianity

The evolution of Catholic Christianity and its historical origins are shrouded in deep mystery. We have no knowledge of the actual history of the first half of the first century. For the next hundred years, we mostly rely on guesses. The now accepted canonical account was chosen from a mix of tradition and legend. The concept of a New Testament Canon only appears in the second half of the second century and is gradually developed by the Church of Rome and the Western Fathers. Early theologians from Alexandria, like Clement, were still unaware of a specific Canon.

Following the first Christian apologists like Justin, and using this evolving Canon as the measure of orthodoxy, Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Hippolytus, supported by the Roman Church, laid the foundations of "catholicity" and started building the massive structure of dogma considered today as the true view of the Church of Christ. However, the first two centuries do not confirm the later orthodox claim of "one church, one faith, always and everywhere." Instead, they show many different lines of belief, practice, and organization evolving. The struggle for survival was intense, and while the "survival of the fittest" prevailed as usual, there were often crises where the final "fittest" is barely visible or disappears.

The view that eventually became the orthodox tradition is mainly based on Gospel documents likely composed during the reign of Hadrian (A.D. 117-138). The basis of three of these Gospels was probably a collection of Sayings and a narrative of actions, forming an ideal life sketch created by one of the "Apostles" of the inner communities for public use.

Around this core, the compilers of the three documents added other material chosen from a vast collection of myths, legends, and traditions. These compilers were clearly very devout, and their careful selection resulted in narratives of great dignity, while discarding much of the foolish and fantastical content that was circulating at the time. Some of this discarded content is still preserved in various apocryphal Gospels. The author of the fourth document was a natural mystic who enhanced his account with beautiful ideas and feelings, reflecting the highest inspiration. Fortunately, the canonical selection preserved documents of much greater historical value.

In the Letters of Paul, most of which I believe are largely authentic, we find the earliest historical records of Christianity that we have. The Pauline Letters date back to the middle of the first century and serve as the true starting point for any serious historical research into the origins of Christianity. When reading these Letters, it is almost impossible to believe that Paul was familiar with the statements found in the later historicized accounts of the four canonical Gospels.

All his ideas convey a completely different atmosphere. Instead of preaching about the Jesus of the historicized Gospels, he teaches the doctrine of the mystic Christ. He appears to be unaware of both the actions and sayings of Jesus as we know them; however, it is almost certain that some collection of Jesus' sayings must have existed and been used by his followers at that time. Even though there were numerous opportunities in his writings to refer to the canonical sayings and actions, which would have greatly strengthened his messages, he refrains from doing so.

Paul's letters are filled with ideas and technical terms that aren't explained in mainstream Christianity, but are essential to those who follow Gnosticism. The letters of Paul depict the situation in the mid-first century as that of an independent preacher with his own insights, who was in touch with both an inner circle of ideas and various outer communities. These outer communities included Jewish synagogues, Essene synagogues, and groups that had received some teachings of Jesus, whether they understood them correctly or not.

Paul's goal was to break down Jewish exclusiveness and pave the way for the spread of Christianity to the Gentiles. According to Harnack, the century following Paul's efforts (50-150 AD) was marked by the following characteristics:

1. The rapid decline of Jewish (primitive and original) Christianity.
2. Every community member was believed to have received the "Spirit of God"; teachings were considered "charismatic" or spiritual gifts.
3. There was a widespread expectation of the imminent end of the age and Christ's thousand-year reign on earth, known as "chiliasm."
4. Christianity was seen as a way of life, not a set of doctrines.
5. There were no fixed doctrinal forms, allowing for great freedom in Christian preaching.
6. The Sayings of the Lord and the Old Testament were not yet absolute authorities; the "Spirit" could override them.
7. There was no fixed political union of the Churches; each community was independent. This period produced a unique literature that created fictional accounts for both the past and future. It did not follow the usual literary rules and formats but presented itself with high aspirations. Specific teachings and arguments of supposed "Apostolic Teachers" were given great importance. Despite a tendency to move away from Jewish roots, there was a genuine effort to make Christianity universal. This effort to universalize Christianity is the main inspiration behind the best Gnostic works we need to consider. However, this universalizing trend does not align with the traditional origins of Christianity.

#### The Ebionites

According to Epiphanius, the Christians were initially called Iessaei, a name mentioned in Philo's writings. The early followers of Jesus were also known as Nazoraei. Even at the end of the fourth century, the Nazoraeans were still spread across Coele-Syria, Decapolis, Pella (where they fled during the destruction of Jerusalem), the region beyond Jordan, and as far as Mesopotamia. Their collection of teachings, known as The Gospel according to the Hebrews, was significantly different from the synoptic Gospels in the New Testament.

Even today, some believe that a remnant of the Nazoraeans survives in the Mandaites, a peculiar sect living in the marshes of Southern Babylonia. However, their scripture, The Book of Adam, found in the Codex Nasaraeus, has no similarity to the known fragments of The Gospel according to the Hebrews. Still, some of their rituals are very similar to those of certain communities mentioned in the Jewish pseudepigraph, The Sibylline Oracles.

The true identity of the original Iessaeans or Nazoraeans remains a mystery. Under another name, the Ebionites or "Poor Men," more information is available. These early followers of Jesus were eventually excluded from orthodox Christianity. Their origins and history were so obscured by later heresy-hunters that they were linked to a fictional figure named Ebion, just as other heretics like Epiphanes, Kolarbasus, and Elkesai were created by fourth-century heresiologists and "historians."

Epiphanes was a later representation of an unnamed "distinguished" teacher, Kolarbasus symbolized the "sacred four," and Elkesai represented the "hidden power." The zeal of these heresy-hunters led them to invent names of heretics from epithets and doctrines. The Ebionites were originally called "poor" because of their economic status, but later orthodox Christians added "in intelligence" or "in their ideas about Christ." This might have been true, as many likely misunderstood Jesus's teachings. It's important to remember that one of the main factors in the rapid spread of the new religion was the social revolution.

In the minds of the most ignorant of the earliest followers of public teaching, the greatest hope might have been the near arrival of a time when the "poor" would be elevated above the "rich." However, this was only the view of the most uninformed, though they were likely numerous. Ebionism preserved the tradition of the earliest converts of public teaching, and the Ebionite communities likely had a collection of the public Sayings and lived according to them. These original followers of Jesus' public teaching were who Paul opposed in his efforts to spread Christianity to non-Jews.

For many years, the Petro-Pauline controversy was fought bitterly, and some believe that the Canon of the New Testament was created to reconcile both sides. The Petrine and Pauline documents were carefully edited, and the Acts of the Apostles was added as a link between the Gospels and Paul's letters. This narrative was crafted from a large collection of legendary Acts and decorated with speeches in the style of Thucydides.

How did the original Ebionites view Jesus and his teachings? They saw him as a wise man, a prophet, even a figure like Jonah or Solomon. He was a manifestation of the Messiah, the Anointed One who was to come, but he had not yet appeared in that role; that would happen at his second coming. In his life as Jesus, he was simply a prophet. The New Dispensation was just a continuation of the Old Law; everything was essentially Jewish.

They therefore expected the coming of the Messiah as literally prophesied by their ancestors. He was to come as a king, and then all nations would be subjected to the power of the Chosen People, leading to a thousand years of peace, prosperity, and plenty on earth. Jesus was a man, born to Joseph and Mary like any other person. It was only at his baptism, when he was thirty years old, that the Spirit descended upon him and he became a prophet. His followers treasured his teachings and passed them down orally. The Ebionites did not believe in Jesus's pre-existence or divinity. They saw him as the "christ," but believed anyone who followed the Law could also be "christ." Therefore, they completely rejected Paul and his new doctrine, viewing him as a deceiver and a traitor to the Law, even denying that he was a Jew.

Later, they used The Gospel according to the Hebrews, which Jerome said was the same as The Gospel of the Twelve Apostles and The Gospel of the Nazarenes. The Nazoraeans, however, were unaware of the legend of Nazareth, which was developed later by those who wanted to align events with prophecies. The Ebionites did not return to Jerusalem when Emperor Hadrian allowed the establishment of Aelia Capitolina in 138, as Jews were not permitted to return.

The new city was Gentile. Therefore, when church historians mention the "re-constitution of the mother church" in Aelia Colonia, these claims are unreliable. The original "mother church," based on public teachings, was Ebionite and remained so, while the community in Aelia Colonia was Gentile and hence followed Paul's teachings.

Christianity, as understood by the Ebionites, was essentially a national doctrine. Paulinism became necessary to make Christianity a universal religion. As a result, the true historical aspect of popular Christianity, which followed the Ebionite tradition, gradually became obscured. Eventually, it disappeared so thoroughly from this tradition that a new "history" could be safely created to match the doctrinal developments initiated by Paul.

However, later forms of Ebionism, which survived for several centuries, took on a Gnostic nature. These forms indicate that outer communities of early Christianity, based on public teachings, had contact with an inner Jewish tradition. This tradition evidently existed at the same time as Paul and may have existed much earlier.

#### The Essenes

Based on the sayings preserved in the canonical Gospels and descriptions of communities in the Acts, many have suggested that Jesus was either a member of or intimately familiar with the doctrines and practices of the Essene communities. Who were these Essenes, or Healers?

For centuries before the Christian era, Essene communities lived on the shores of the Dead Sea. During the time of Philo and Josephus, these Essenes held great reverence for Moses and the Law. They believed in God as the creator, the immortality of the soul, and a future state of retribution. Finding it impossible to adhere to the strict purity laws in everyday life, they adopted an ascetic communal lifestyle. Their main characteristic was the doctrine of love: love for God, love of virtue, and love for humanity.

The practical application of their precepts earned widespread admiration. Their strict observance of the purification rules established by Levitical laws led them to become a self-sustaining community. Everyone worked at a trade, cultivated their fields, and made their own food and clothing, thus avoiding contact with people who did not follow the same rules. They also appeared to be strict celibates within their inner circles.

Their daily routine was as follows: they rose before dawn and remained silent until they gathered together to pray for the renewal of light while facing the sunrise. Each person then went to their assigned task under the supervision of elected stewards or overseers ("bishops"). At eleven o'clock, they assembled again, changed out of their work clothes, and performed a daily baptism in cold water. Afterward, they dressed in white linen robes and proceeded to their communal meal, which they saw as a sacrament. The dining hall was considered a "holy temple." They ate in silence, and the food was simple—bread and vegetables. A blessing was said before the meal, and thanks were given afterward. Members sat according to seniority. They returned to work until the evening, when they gathered again for another communal meal.

Certain hours of the day were dedicated to studying the mysteries of nature, revelation, and the powers of celestial beings, including the names of angels. This inner instruction was kept highly secret. This was their routine on weekdays, while the Sabbath was observed with strictness. They had no priests; anyone who felt inspired could read the Law and explain the mysteries of the Tetragrammaton, the four-letter name of the Creative Power, and the angelic realms.

The Essenes were evidently influenced by Chaldean "kabbalism" and Zoroastrian purity traditions. However, they avoided logic and metaphysics, considering them harmful to a devotional life. The community had four levels: (1) novices; (2) approachers; (3) new full members, or associates; (4) old members, or elders.

(1) After the first year, the novice gave all their possessions to the communal treasury and received a copy of the rules, a spade (for purposes described in Moses' camp regulations), and a white robe symbolizing purity. However, the novice was still excluded from purification rites and communal meals.

(2) After two more years, the novice participated in purification rites but was still excluded from communal meals.

(3) Associates were bound by solemn oaths, and any misconduct could only be judged by the "assembly" of one hundred members.

Essenism is sometimes considered an extreme form of Pharisaism. This may surprise those who know the Pharisees only from canonical texts, as the highest goal of this enlightened Jewish school was to achieve such holiness that they could perform miraculous cures and prophesy. The "degrees of holiness" practiced by the Pharisees were:

(1) studying the Law and being careful;

(2) the novitiate, symbolized by an apron for purity;

(3) external purity through lustrations or baptisms;

(4) celibacy;

(5) purity of thought;

(6) an undefined higher stage;

(7) meekness and holiness;

(8) fear of all sin;

(9) the highest stage of holiness;

(10) the stage that enabled one to heal the sick and raise the dead.

We should remember that the Healers completely rejected the blood sacrifices of Temple worship and did not believe in the resurrection of the physical body, a key belief of the Pharisees.

This brief overview cannot fully explore the similarities between the practices of the Essenes and those of the Therapeutae of Egypt, as well as the Orphic and Pythagorean schools. Each topic mentioned in these essays could fill a book or several books for proper explanation; we can only provide basic guidance and encourage readers to explore further on their own.

However, before moving on, it’s important to note the similarities between many Essene rules and the teachings and traditions of the Gospels. New converts had to sell their possessions and give to the poor, as accumulating wealth was seen as harmful to spiritual life. The Essenes not only shunned wealth but also lived in self-imposed poverty.

Love for the brotherhood and one's neighbor was central to Essene life and the foundation of all their actions, earning them widespread admiration. Members lived together like a family, shared everything, and appointed a steward to manage communal resources.

When traveling, they stayed with fellow members they had never met before, as if with lifelong friends, and thus they carried nothing with them on their journeys. All members were considered equals, and no one held authority over another; however, mutual service was strongly emphasized. They were also passionate advocates of peace, refusing to take up arms or make weapons, and they forbade slavery.

The Essenes aimed to be humble and gentle, to control all sinful desires, to be pure-hearted, to hate evil but help wrongdoers, and to be merciful to everyone. They valued honesty, saying "yes" when they meant yes, and "no" when they meant no. They were dedicated to healing both body and soul and saw the ability to perform miraculous cures and cast out evil spirits as the highest achievement.

Essentially, they sought to be so pure that they became vessels of the Holy Spirit, thereby becoming seers and prophets. They had inner communities and outer circles of students living in major centers of the Diaspora. Philo noted that the Essenes were focused on practical life, while the Therapeuts were concerned with the contemplative life, dealing with higher religious and philosophical issues, which is where Gnosticism found its best expression.

#### The Tendencies of Gnosticism

However, accurate historical details about Gnosticism are hard to come by. The term "Tendenz," used by Germans, refers to a general inclination or trend. Harnack describes Gnosticism as the "acute secularizing of Christianity." This means that Catholic dogma evolved from the gradual integration of general Christianity with philosophical and theological methods. Popular beliefs evolve over time, and the conclusions reached by society after centuries are often anticipated by educated individuals long before. Pioneers like Galileo were usually condemned by their contemporaries.

The Gnostic mindset quickly reached many conclusions that Catholics only accepted after many years of hesitation, as well as some ideas that even today seem ahead of their time. Theosophic students are always ahead in religious matters because they strive to speed up natural evolution and achieve a mystical goal that is always close within, but for most people, seems far away on the normal path of external evolution.

The term "acute secularizing of Christianity" refers to the rapid development and organization of Christian theology, but this doesn't fully explain the situation. Gnosticism existed before Christianity; Christ enlightened its traditions and made public many teachings that were previously kept secret. Over time, much of what was reserved for the "worthy" became public due to various pressures, including Paul's teachings and later debates.

The Gnostics believed there were two types of traditions: public teachings and inner teachings that the general public couldn't understand. Initially, they kept these inner teachings to themselves and only gradually shared a small part of them, keeping the rest secret because they knew it wouldn't be understood by most people.

The Gnostics were the first Christian theologians. If it's wrong that the true historical aspects of the new movement were hidden to fit a universal religion, then the Gnostics are mainly to blame. Catholicism eventually accepted the Old Testament literally and adopted the beliefs of popular Judaism and the Yahweh-cult. However, in its early years, it leaned towards an allegorical interpretation.

Gnosticism, on the other hand, often rejected the Old Testament documents completely. When it didn't, it used an allegorical approach and a critical method to classify the "inspiration" of the texts, removing many of the objectionable parts from the Jewish Canon. In pursuit of a universal ideal, the tribal God Yahweh, or at least the crude views of Yahweh held by the uneducated Jewish populace, was either rejected or given a very minor role. Essentially, the Yahweh of the Elohim was not considered the Father of Jesus; the Demiurgos, or creative power of the world, was not the supreme Mystery God.

Just as the idea of the true God was greater than popular notions of deity, the true teachings of Gnosticism illuminated the enigmatic sayings and parables. The ethical teachings and parables of Jesus needed interpretation. The literal meaning was enough for the common people, but for the truly spiritual, there was a deeper, infinite meaning that could be revealed to the true Gnostic. Thus, the plain ethical teachings and obscure sayings were for the uneducated, but there was a deeper, esoteric doctrine meant only for the worthy.

Many gospels and apocalypses were compiled under the claimed inspiration of the "Spirit." These texts were said to contain the teachings Jesus gave to His disciples after His "resurrection from the dead," a mystical phrase they interpreted as the new birth or Gnostic enlightenment—the awakening of the soul from its previous dead state. However, even these Gnostic writings did not reveal everything. While they explained many things in terms of internal states and spiritual processes, they left much unexplained. The final revelations were shared only orally and through visions.

Gnostics divided humanity into three classes:

1. **Hylics**: The lowest class, completely unresponsive to spiritual matters, akin to unperceptive matter.
2. **Psychics**: The intermediate class, who believed in spiritual things but needed miracles and signs to strengthen their faith.
3. **Pneumatics**: The highest class, who were capable of understanding spiritual matters and receiving Gnosis.

Today, it is common in some extreme circles to claim that all people are "equal." Modern theologians wisely qualify this by saying "morally equal." This idea is not uniquely Christian—it is shared by all major religions as it asserts the principle of justice. The Gnostic view, however, is clearer and aligns more with the facts of evolution. It acknowledges moral equality but also asserts differences in body, soul, and spirit to make morality proportional, thus fulfilling the deeper meaning of the parable of the talents.

This classification applied not only to people but also to powers. The prophets of the Old Testament, as instruments of these powers, were ranked in an order of importance. However, the personality of Jesus, the prophet of the new message, posed a significant challenge for the Gnostic scholars. Their opinions varied widely—from the original Ebionite belief that Jesus was simply a good and holy man, to the opposite extreme that he was not only a manifestation of God's Logos (a familiar concept in ancient Eastern thought) but truly God incarnate. This extreme belief arose from an enthusiastic desire to surpass the claims of every existing religion.

Jesus was thus burdened with representing every possibility of the mystical world and every hidden power of human nature. To reconcile the ideas of a suffering man with those of a triumphant initiator and king of the universe (both physical and intellectual), they turned to the theory of Docetism. This theory could address every contradiction between the divine and human natures of their ideal figure.

The docetic theory is the theory of "appearance." It made a clear distinction between Christ, the divine being or perfected "man," and Jesus, the individual person. According to this theory, Christ, the divine, did not suffer but only appeared to suffer; it was the human Jesus who truly suffered. Alternatively, Christ was not genuinely incarnated in the man Jesus but assumed a phantom body called Jesus.

These were later doctrinal developments based on certain underlying beliefs: (a) that a "perfect" individual can use a phantom body, make it appear and disappear at will, and even make it tangible; and (b) that a master of wisdom can use another person's physical body, usually that of a student, as a medium for teaching. These ideas are found in Gnostic writings and are a significant part of their understanding of Christ, especially regarding the teaching period after the "resurrection."

The Gnostic philosophers tackled lofty questions with remarkable boldness, exploring the origins, destinations, purposes, and mechanisms of things. Their view of the universe was incredibly grand and complex, extending beyond the physical world to the intellectual and spiritual realms within the mind of the deity. They proposed a transcendental aeonology that depicted the workings of divine thought. Their understanding of human origins was equally complex, and they believed in the high potential of the human soul and spirit.

Regarding their theory of salvation, they did not limit it to the simplistic idea of a physical sacrifice by one person but expanded it into a vast cosmic process driven by the will of the Logos in His own nature. Their doctrine of "last things" envisioned a future where the "spiritual" would achieve "nirvana," the "psychic" would experience eternal bliss, and the "material" would remain in darkness until the end of the "Great Peace." This is quite different from the simplistic idea of eternal feasting on earth, which Harnack describes as a "sensuous eudaemonistic eschatology."

The core of their teachings centered around the idea of cyclic laws for both the universe and the individual soul. The Gnostics consistently taught about the preexistence and rebirth of human souls. Despite emphasizing the forgiveness of sins, they firmly believed in the unerring law of cause and effect. It's interesting that these two main doctrines, which clarify much of Gnosticism and shed light on many obscure points, have often been either completely ignored or dismissed with brief, apologetic remarks. Critics tend to avoid discussing concepts like "reincarnation" and "fate," rather than clarifying these key tenets.

#### The Literature and Sources of Gnosticism

The study of Gnosticism has mostly been limited to specialists whose works are not easily understood by the general public. Ordinary readers are often put off by the detailed information, complex terms, and obscure theological language, as well as the expectation to know many unfamiliar things.

Hopefully, soon a skilled English scholar will write a clear and accessible introduction to Gnosticism. This would help thoughtful individuals without technical training in Church history and dogmatics to grasp its significance and compelling interest. In the meantime, this essay may serve as a helpful guide to those who are confused. It is not as comprehensive or skillfully written as Maimonides' works, but it offers some notes and pointers that may save the reader years of research.

First, let's talk about books on Gnosticism. The best books are by German scholars, which presents a challenge for those who only read English. For these readers, translations are necessary, if available. Unfortunately, only two such works are available in English. The second volume of Neander's *Church History* (translated in 1890) covers the Gnostics, but it is outdated.

The best modern overview of Gnosticism is found in the first volume of Harnack's *History of Dogma*, translated in 1894. For more detailed information, *Smith and Wace's Dictionary of Christian Biography* (1877-1887) is essential. This work includes a general article on Gnosticism, detailed articles on each Gnostic teacher, and shorter articles on various Gnostic terms. It is authored by Lipsius, Salmon, and Hort, whose expertise ensures thoroughness.

These last two works provide a solid foundation for understanding the subject, backed by rigorous scholarship and critical insight. It is a pleasure to praise such work, although the perspective of these distinguished scholars is not sufficiently open-minded for someone who believes that every honest effort to understand the truth comes from a higher source.

Among other English works, we can mention King's *Gnostics and their Remains* (2nd edition, 1887), which is intended for general readers. King strongly emphasizes a distinct Indian influence in Gnosticism and addresses several interesting points, but his work lacks the depth of a specialist. However, he is far from orthodox and shows great sympathy for the Gnostics. The weakest part of King's work is his focus on Gnostic "remains" like amulets and talismans, which he, as a numismatologist, found particularly interesting. These are now believed by experts to likely have no connection to the Gnostics. Nonetheless, King's book is worth reading.

Mansel's posthumous work, *The Gnostic Heresies of the First and Second Centuries* (1875), is not only unsympathetic but also unfairly judges the Gnostics by modern German philosophical standards, as Mansel once held a philosophy chair. Norton's *Evidences of the Genuineness of the Gospels* (1847) dedicates its second volume to the Gnostics, but its value is limited. Burton's *Inquiry into the Heresies of the Apostolic Age* (1829) reads like it was written by an early Church Father. Both Norton's and Burton's efforts, as well as Mansel's, are now outdated and only available second-hand.

This covers the works in English that deal directly with Gnosticism. The student will find in Harnack's work brief but insightful bibliographies at the end of each chapter, listing all the best works, especially by German scholars. In Smith and Wace's Dictionary, each article is also followed by a useful bibliography. A short general bibliography, along with a list of nearly all the latest work on the only direct documents of Gnosticism that we have, can be found in the Introduction to my translation of the Gnostic treatise Pistis Sophia (1896). Additionally, a classified bibliography of the most important works is attached to this essay.

The student will be surprised to see how little information is available in English compared to the extensive encyclopedic work in German, and how France also closely competes with England in this field of Church history and theological research. However, discussing these works does not fit within the scope of this short essay.

So much for the general literature on the subject in English; we now need to briefly consider the indirect and direct documents of Gnosticism. By "indirect" documents, I mean the polemical writings of the Fathers of the orthodox Catholic Church. These indirect documents were practically the only sources of information until 1853, when Schwartze's translation of the Pistis Sophia was published.

By "direct" documents, I mean the few Gnostic treatises we have received through Coptic translations. Therefore, our indirect sources of information come from the most vehement opponents of Gnosticism; and we must remember the intense bitterness of religious controversy throughout history, especially in the early centuries of the Church, which makes us highly skeptical of the reliability of such sources.

Furthermore, the most reliable sources are mainly found in the writings of the early Western Church Fathers. These individuals were less capable of understanding the philosophical and mystical issues that troubled the Eastern communities. The Roman and Western mindset never fully comprehended Greek and Eastern thought. The Western Church Fathers were always strong advocates of "orthodoxy."

We should also note that there are no surviving contemporary refutations from the first century (if any existed) or from the first three quarters of the second century. The principal source on Gnosticism is the "Refutation of Irenaeus," written in Lyons, Gaul, far from the actual events, around the late second century. Later refutations rely heavily on Irenaeus's treatise, often copying the work of the Gallic bishop. If Irenaeus is proven unreliable, the entire foundation of refutation is weakened. This critical point will be discussed later.

Before Irenaeus, Agrippa Castor, who lived around 135 A.D. during the reign of Hadrian, was said by Eusebius to be the first to write against heresies. Unfortunately, his work is lost. Justin Martyr, the apologist, also wrote a work against heresies called "Syntagma" or "Compendium," which is also lost. Based on Justin's account of the Gospel story in his surviving works, it seems that the "Memoirs of the Apostles" he frequently mentions were not the same as our four canonical Gospels, although these Gospels may have been taking their current form at that time. It is possible that Justin's work on heresies shed too much light on pre-canonical controversies, making its continued use undesirable. This might also explain the disappearance of Agrippa Castor's work. Justin lived around 140-160 A.D.

Clement of Alexandria, whose most significant literary work occurred between 190-203 A.D., resided in the main center of Gnostic activity and knew some of the prominent Gnostic teachers personally. Unlike many Church Fathers who later accused Gnostics of widespread immorality, Clement's writings mostly avoided such accusations. Modern scholars agree that these accusations against the major Gnostic schools and their teachers were baseless, as most were strict ascetics. This will become clearer later.

Clement is thought to have addressed the higher aspects of Gnosticism in his lost work, The Outlines, where he tried to create a comprehensive system of Christian teaching. The first three books were similar to the three stages of the Platonists: (i.) Purification, (ii.) Initiation, (iii.) Direct Vision. Unfortunately, this work is also lost. It was a continuation of his well-known Miscellanies, in which he aimed to prove himself a true Gnostic.

Tertullian of Carthage (around 200-220 A.D.), known for his intolerance, "fiery zeal," and harsh language, wrote against heresies, mainly copying Irenaeus. However, for the Marcionites, he is considered an independent source. Some of the treatise against heresies attributed to Tertullian was actually written by an unknown author, leading to the term Pseudo-Tertullian.

Hippolytus, Bishop of Portus at the mouth of the Tiber, was a disciple of Irenaeus. He wrote a lost Compendium against all heresies, mostly based on Irenaeus, but a much larger work by him was discovered at Mount Athos in 1842. This text claims to be a Refutation of All Heresies and significantly adds to our knowledge from indirect sources. It is not just a copy of Irenaeus' work but includes a lot of new material, with quotes from some Gnostic manuscripts that Hippolytus had obtained. This work is believed to have been written around 222 A.D.

Around the same time (225-250 A.D.), Origen, a prominent Alexandrian Father, wrote a refutation against a philosopher named Celsus, who is thought to have been the first opponent of Christianity and lived about 75 years before Origen. Origen's work contains passages referring to some Gnostics. Including Origen's work against Celsus' "The True Word," we have now mentioned all the early Christian Fathers who are valuable for understanding the indirect sources of Gnosticism in the first two centuries.

Philaster, the bishop of Brescia in Italy; Epiphanius, the bishop of Salamis in Cyprus; and Jerome, all belong to the last quarter of the fourth century. Therefore, unless they are quoting earlier writers, their accounts are too late to be accurate about the first two centuries. Philaster is often dismissed due to his excessive gullibility, and Epiphanius' reliability is frequently questioned because of his tendency to invent or repeat scandals.

Eusebius, who wrote fifty years earlier, does not provide much useful information on the topic, and his accuracy is doubted by many historical critics. Theodoret's Compendium, based on earlier works and dating from the mid-fifth century, is also too late to contribute to our knowledge of the first two centuries. The study of these indirect documents has challenged scholars, resulting in an impressive scholarly achievement.

Lipsius has shown that Epiphanius, Philaster, and Pseudo-Tertullian all used a common source, the lost Syntagma or Compendium of Hippolytus. This source mainly consisted of notes from the lectures of Irenaeus, which were likely his polemical writings presented to his community. By reconstructing this lost document and comparing it with the works of Irenaeus, Lipsius suggests that both drew from a common authority, probably the lost Syntagma of Justin. Therefore, Irenaeus emerges as our main source. The Refutation of Irenaeus is considered the primary repository of Gnostic teachings for the first two centuries, according to the Church Fathers.

Irenaeus lived far away in Gaul; can we trust his evidence? Despite the general belief that no ecclesiastical writer of that time could be fair to the views of his opponents, whom he saw as followers of evil, recent findings have provided proof supporting this presumption.

Meanwhile, let us focus on our direct sources. We now have three Codices containing Coptic translations of original Greek Gnostic works:

1. The Askew Codex, a vellum manuscript at the British Museum in London, containing the Pistis Sophia treatise and extracts from The Books of the Saviour.
2. The Bruce Codex, consisting of two distinct manuscripts on papyrus at the Bodleian Library in Oxford, containing a series of lengthy fragments titled The Book of the Great Logos according to the Mystery, another untitled sublime treatise, and fragments of yet another treatise.
3. The Akhmim Codex, a papyrus manuscript at the Egyptian Museum in Berlin, containing The Gospel of Mary (or Apocryphon of John), The Wisdom of Jesus Christ, and The Acts of Peter. This Codex was only discovered in 1896.

Before 1853, when the Askew Codex was translated into Latin, its contents were unknown. Similarly, the contents of the Bruce Codex were not known until translations appeared in French and German in 1891-1892. We must consider the indifference that allowed these important documents to remain untranslated for so long—eighty years for the Askew Codex and one hundred and twenty years for the Bruce Codex.

The first English translation appeared only in 1896 in my version of Pistis Sophia. This shows that the study of Gnosticism from direct sources is quite recent, and older research is now outdated. This new perspective is reinforced by the latest discovery of the Akhmim Manuscript, which allows us to test the accuracy of Irenaeus, a key figure in the study of heresies. The Gospel of Mary is one of the sources used by Irenaeus. We can now compare his work point by point and see that he has condensed and paraphrased his original sources so much that the Gnostic system he tried to refute appears as a confusing mess. This recent surge in Gnostic research coincides with a growing interest in theosophic studies, prompting a reconsideration of Gnosticism from a different perspective than pure criticism or refutation.

From the above considerations, it is clear that despite the Gnostics' opponents' efforts to erase them from history, the Gnostics and their ideas are far from forgotten. At the dawn of the twentieth century, during a time of renewed Biblical criticism, the memory of these early Christian thinkers is gaining renewed attention from serious religious scholars.

Besides indirect and direct sources, there is another valuable source of information that deserves more scrutiny: the legends and traditions preserved in the Gnostic Acts. We hope to demonstrate their importance by quoting several of them in the following sections.

## The Gnosis According to its Foes

"Oh that mine adversary had written a book!" - Job (Authorized Version)

### Some Gnostic Fragments Recovered from the Polemical Writings of the Church Fathers

We will now introduce the reader to the main teachers and schools of Gnosticism, as known from the critical writings of the Church Fathers. Unfortunately, we cannot provide a satisfactory classification of the Gnostic schools; all previous attempts have failed, and with our current knowledge, we must do our best to identify the different phases of development.

At the end of the second century, Clement of Alexandria attempted to categorize Christian schools into ascetic and licentious groups. In the early 19th century, Neander tried classifying them by their friendly or hostile relations to Judaism. Baur followed by considering their views on both Judaism and Heathenism. Matter used a geographical approach, dividing them into Syrian, Asia Minor, and Egyptian schools. Lipsius later provided a broader division into Syrian and Alexandrian Gnosticism. However, all these classifications have significant flaws. Therefore, we have to rely on the early Patristic heresiologists, who vaguely and uncritically attributed the origin of Gnosticism to "Simon Magus."

It is clear that the origins of Gnostic ideas are far from simple and cannot be traced back to a single individual. Some believe that these ideas emerged from what is called "Ophitism," a term used by heresiologists for teachings they couldn't attribute to a specific teacher. The mix of schools and tendencies that the Fathers labeled as Ophite contained a variety of elements, both good and bad. The term Ophite, meaning "serpent-worshipper," was used as an insult by critics, while the followers of these schools called themselves "Gnostics" and were likely the first to use this term.

First, we will trace the "Simonian" lineage until the early second century. Then, we will explore the chaotic world of the "Gnostics." After that, we will examine a Gnostic phase of the Ebionite tradition. Finally, we will discuss the most remarkable period of Gnosticism, when thinkers like Basilides, Valentinus, and Bardesanes were active, and Marcion challenged early orthodoxy with a bold "higher criticism" that remains unmatched even today. This period produced works so excellent that, as Dr. Carl Schmidt noted in his introduction to the Codex Brucianus, we are amazed by the boldness of their ideas, impressed by their richness of thought, and moved by their depth of soul. It was a time when Gnostic brilliance soared like an eagle, striving for pure light and knowledge, often losing itself in ecstatic visions.

When studying the lives and teachings of these Gnostics, we must remember that our information primarily comes from critics who exaggerated the points they found absurd, often ignoring the ethical and general teachings. As a result, we have a very distorted view of these individuals, whose main fault was being ahead of their time.

Additionally, the term "heresy" in the first two centuries did not have the narrow, negative meaning it later acquired. It was simply a term for a philosophical school, much like we speak of the schools of Plato, Zeno, and Aristotle. The Gnostics, along with the rest of early Christians, were divided into various schools or "heresies," which were considered more or less equally important and authentic at the time.

#### The "Simonians"

There is no reason to believe that the Gnostics referred to as "Simonians" by the early Church Fathers would have identified with that name or acknowledged the lineage attributed to them by their opponents. As early as Justin Martyr (around 150 A.D.), "Simon" was given a significance far beyond his actual historical role. Justin clearly despised him and accused the Romans of worshipping Simon as a god, based on an inscription on a statue in Rome. Justin claimed the inscription read "Simoni Deo Sancto" – "To Simon, the holy God." However, archaeology has since found that the statue was actually dedicated to a Sabine deity named "Semo Sancus," discrediting Justin's claim. Despite this, later writers accepted Justin's statement without question, reflecting the uncritical nature of that era.

It is likely that in Justin's many debates defending his particular view of Christianity, he encountered arguments that used Simon as an example. For instance, Justin might have argued that Jesus' miracles proved his divine claims, only to be countered with the argument that Simon was also a renowned miracle worker who made similar claims. This could have led Justin to strongly dislike Simon and to see his influence everywhere, even mistakenly identifying a statue of a Sabine god as one dedicated to Simon.

It is possible that a man named Simon, a wonder-worker, amazed people in Samaria with his tricks, and that stories about him were still told during Justin's time. However, what solidified the legend that Simon was the first heretic was the inclusion of his name in one of the stories in the canonical Acts of the Apostles. This happened after Justin's time, marking the beginning of the legend of the origin of heresy (and, according to the Church Fathers, Gnosticism). The information about "Simon" and the "Simonians" is only useful for understanding some of the ideas that the early Catholic Church was trying to refute; it is not historically accurate.

#### Dositheus

The legendary background of the Pseudo-Clementine writings tells us that Dositheus was the predecessor of "Simon Magus." He is mentioned in early heresiologists' lists, a Samaritan Chronicle, and the fourteenth-century Chronicle of Aboulfatah. However, all these mentions are legendary, and nothing reliable can be confirmed about him. His importance is shown by the persistence of the Dosithean sect until the sixth century; Aboulfatah claims it lasted until the fourteenth century.

Both Dositheus and "Simon Magus" were said to be followers of John the Baptist and were opposed to Jesus. Dositheus claimed to be the promised prophet "like unto Moses," while "Simon" made an even higher claim. Like many others of that time, both claimed to be the Messiah. The Dositheans lived a lifestyle similar to that of the Essenes, had their own secret texts, and apparently, a significant amount of literature.

Dositheus (also known as Dousis, Dusis, or Dosthai) was likely an Arab. There were many mystic communities in Arabia similar to those of the Essenes and Therapeuts. One of the Gospels used by Justin, called "Memoirs of the Apostles," mentions that the "wise men" came from Arabia. A legend even claims that Dositheus founded the Sadducee sect. Later traditions say he had thirty disciples, or more precisely, twenty-nine and a half (the number of days in a lunar month), with one being a woman. This suggests that Dositheus's system was based on the lunar calendar, just as later systems attributed to Jesus were based on the solar calendar, with twelve disciples representing the twelve months or zodiac signs.

Dositheus is said to have claimed to be a manifestation of the "Standing One," or unchanging principle, a name also given to the highest principle of the "Simonians." The one female disciple was Helena (the Greek name for the moon or month, Selene), who also appears in the legend of Simon. From the traditions about Dositheus, we can glimpse the sources of pre-Christian Gnosis from Arab, Phoenician, Syrian, and Babylonian origins. Interestingly, this could also hint at a source for the later concept of thirty aeons in the Valentinian pleroma (or ideal world), with the divided thirtieth aeon, Sophia, representing the World-soul or the fundamental substance of a world-system.

It is worth noting that Aboulfatah places Dositheus around 100 years B.C. Although we should be cautious about trusting this late chronicler completely, it is possible he had access to sources that are no longer available to us. The statement is interesting because it shows that the chronicler recognized the existence of a pre-Christian Gnosis. However, how he aligns this with John the Baptist's date and orthodox chronology is unclear. Could he have been influenced by the Talmudic tradition that dates Jesus a century before our era? Along with Dositheus and Simon, Hegesippus (according to Eusebius) also mentions Cleobius, Gorthaeus, and Masbotheus as leading figures of early Christian schools.

#### Simon Magus

As mentioned, Simon Magus is referenced in the Acts of the Apostles, a New Testament document not quoted before 177 A.D. Irenaeus and others repeat the Acts story. Justin Martyr (around 150 A.D.) talks about a Simon of Gitta, revered by almost all Samaritans, who claimed to be an incarnation of the "Great Power" and had many followers. Justin doesn't mention the Acts story, leading some to think there were two Simons, but this seems unnecessary. Justin's account is the basis of the Simonian legend, which was further developed by the Pseudo-Clementine literature in the third century, based on the second-century Circuits of Peter.

At the start of the third century, Hippolytus preserved a few fragments from the extensive Simonian literature. The bishop of Portus quotes a work titled The Great Announcement, giving us insight into one of these Gnostic systems. The Gnostic system described in this document is not a primitive or undeveloped form of Gnostic thought. Instead, it represents a highly advanced stage of Gnostic tradition. While it is not as intricate as the Valentinian system, it is almost as mature as the Barbelo system, which Irenaeus mentioned briefly and is partly recovered in the newly-discovered Gospel of Mary.

In the earliest times, which later Catholic Christians traced their traditions, there were many prophetic and reformative movements in and around Palestine. These included various prophets and teachers who promoted ethical, mystical, religious-philosophical, and Gnostic doctrines. The Ebionite communities often found themselves in conflict with the followers of these teachers on many issues.

The Ebionite tradition recorded a distorted account of these doctrinal conflicts. Above all, the Ebionites were in fierce opposition to the Pauline churches. Later, mainstream Christianity attempted to reconcile the differences between the followers of Peter and Paul, mainly through the Acts document. Over time, the Ebionite tradition was also revised in light of this new perspective, and the name Simon was used instead of the great "heretic" whom the Ebionites opposed.

Eventually, the modified Ebionite tradition, which was likely first written in the "Circuits of Peter," evolved into a story. This story vividly depicts the conflicts between Simon Peter the Ebionite and Simon the Magician. In this tale, the magical arts of the Samaritan are thwarted, and his false theology is exposed by the courageous champion of the "Poor Men."

The latest version of this romance cycle places it in a Roman setting. Therefore, Simon is ultimately defeated by Peter in Rome, which aligns with the Roman Church's legend that Peter came to Rome. However, in earlier versions, Peter never travels beyond the East, and Simon is defeated in Antioch. A close examination of the Pseudo-Clementine writings shows several layers of legend, one of which is particularly notable. Baur was the first to highlight this, and his followers from the Tubingen school developed his idea into a theory that Simon Magus is a symbolic representation of Paul. The similarities in the doctrinal disputes between the Petro-Simonian and Petro-Pauline controversies are undeniable, and the scholarly reputation of the Tubingen school dismisses the idea that this is impossible. While it would be extreme to claim that Simon Magus always represents Paul, we can certainly identify this connection in at least one layer of the legend.

The "Simonian" systems, as described by the Church Fathers, share many features with Gnosticism: the concept of a supreme Father, the Logos, the aeon-world or ideal universe, its emanation, and its positive and negative aspects represented as pairs or syzygies. They also feature the world-soul, seen as the thought or female aspect of the Logos, the descent of the soul, the creation of the physical world by builders, and teachings on reincarnation and redemption.

The main characteristic attributed to the "Simonians" was the practice of "magic," which Simon reportedly learned in Egypt. This led to many fantastical stories created by their opponents. It is very likely that the title "Magus" encompasses much more than just the story of the Samaritan miracle-worker, connecting us to a Gnostic link with Persia and the Magi. The fire symbolism mentioned by Hippolytus supports this idea. The "Simonian" Gnosis was similar to the Barbelo-Gnostic and Basilido-Valentinian developments, as seen in the fragments of "The Great Announcement" preserved by Hippolytus.

Most of the "Simonian" literature has been lost, but one important document was called "The Four Quarters of the World." Another notable work contained various controversial points attributed to "Simon," which critically analyzed the God of the Old Testament, especially focusing on the serpent story in Genesis. The main symbolism in the Simon-legend, which was turned into the myth of Simon and Helen, seems to have been related to stars. The Logos and his Thought, the World-soul, were represented by the Sun (Simon) and the Moon (Selene, Helen). In the microcosm, Helen was the human soul trapped in matter, and Simon was the mind that redeems her. One system even tried to interpret the Trojan legend and the myth of Helen in a spiritual and psychological way, showing an effort to use the popular Greek myths, like those in Homeric legend, to support Gnostic ideas. This method extended the Jewish allegorical approach into Greek mythology.

However, the opponents of the "Simonians" among the Church Fathers created the story that Helen was a prostitute Simon had found in Tyre. The name of this city likely led Baur to suggest that the terms Simon (shmsh, Sun) and Helen (Selene, Moon) are linked to the Phoenician worship of sun and moon deities, a practice still observed in that ancient city. Undoubtedly, the old Phoenician and Syrian ideas about the creation of the universe were known to many students of religion at that time, but we don't need to be too exact about such unclear matters.

Irenaeus provides the following summary of the system he attributes to the "Simonians." It is the dramatic myth of the Logos and the World-Soul, also known as Sophia, or Wisdom. Irenaeus claims that Simon made personal claims about Helen, based on a manuscript where Christ, as the Logos, speaks in the first person. We will try to partially restore its original form.

> Wisdom was the first Thought of My Mind, the Mother of All. In the beginning, I conceived in My Mind the creation of the Angels and Archangels. This Thought, knowing her Father's will, descended to the lower regions and created the Angels and Powers, who made the world. After she created them, they detained her out of envy because they didn't want to be seen as the offspring of another. As for Myself, I am entirely unknown to them.

Irenaeus continues summarizing from the manuscript:

> Thought was captured by the Powers and Angels she had created. They subjected her to various indignities to prevent her from returning to her Father, including imprisoning her in a human body and making her transmigrate into other female bodies, moving from one to another. She experienced continual indignity, eventually even standing for hire in a brothel, and she was the 'lost sheep.' I have come to take her away for the first time and free her from her bonds to ensure salvation for men through my knowledge.

The Church Father writes that since the Angels were mismanaging the world, each wanting to rule, He came to set things right. He descended and took on the appearance of the Powers, Principalities, and Angels, appearing to men as a man, though he was not truly a man, and seemed to suffer in Judea, though he did not actually suffer. The prophets made their prophecies under the influence of the Angels who created the world.

These beliefs came from groups who believed in the mystical Christ and are common to many other systems. If Irenaeus had only told us the history of the document he was summarizing and commenting on, or had copied it exactly, he would have saved future generations a lot of work! True, he might have been copying from Justin's writings, and Justin had already done some summarizing and commenting. But even one paragraph of the original document would have given us a better basis for judgment than all the paraphrasing and rhetoric of these two ancient writers who strongly opposed the Gnostics.

Fortunately, Hippolytus, who came later, is more accurate in his quotations and sometimes copies parts of the manuscripts verbatim. He mistakenly attributes one of these to 'Simon' himself, likely because he thought it was the oldest Gnostic manuscript he had. Most critics, however, believe it to be a later version of the Gnosis than the system summarized by Irenaeus, but there's no evidence to support this assumption. By this time, the legend that "Simon" was the first heretic had become accepted as history by heresiologists.

Hippolytus likely felt justified in attributing the contents of the manuscript to someone he believed was the earliest leader of Gnosticism. The manuscript was titled "The Great Announcement," which was likely synonymous with "The Gospel" in the Basilidian sense. It began with the following words: "This is the Writing of the Revelation of Voice-and-Name from Thought, the Great Power, the Boundless. Therefore, it shall be sealed, hidden, concealed, and placed in the Dwelling whose foundation is the Universal Root."

The Dwelling was said to be humanity, the temple of the Holy Spirit. The symbol of the Boundless Power and Universal Root was Fire. Fire was thought to have a dual nature: hidden and manifested. The hidden parts of the Fire are within the manifested, and the manifested parts are produced by the hidden. The manifested side of the Fire contains everything visible to humans and what they unconsciously overlook, while the hidden side consists of everything intelligible, even if it escapes sensation or understanding.

Before providing a direct quotation, Hippolytus gives a lengthy summary of the Gnostic exposition, from which the following represents the writer's thoughts more accurately:

> Of all things hidden and manifested, the Fire above the heavens is like a treasure-house, akin to a great Tree from which all flesh is nourished. The manifested side of the Fire is the trunk, branches, leaves, and outer bark. All these parts of the great Tree are set on fire by the all-consuming flame of the Fire and destroyed. The fruit of the Tree, once fully formed and shaped on its own, is stored away as a treasure, not thrown into the Fire. The fruit is meant to be kept, while the husk is meant to be burned, like the trunk, which exists not for itself but for the fruit.

This symbolism is significant, connecting with the "Trees" and "Treasures" found in Coptic Gnostic texts, as well as with Chaldean and Zoroastrian traditions studied by later Platonists. The fruit of the Fire-tree and the "Flower of Fire" symbolize the immortal man and his spiritual consciousness. Fully understanding this symbolism would also cover the creation of the cosmos and the deification of man.

According to the teachings of Gnosis, as we try to recover from Hippolytus, man is subject to birth and suffering as long as he remains undeveloped. However, once he fully realizes his potential, he becomes like God, free from suffering and birth, achieving perfection.

From The Great Announcement, apparently from the beginning of the treatise, right after the title:

> I tell you what I tell you, and I write what I write. And the writing is this:
>
> Of the universal Aeons, there are two eternal growths from one Root, which is the invisible, incomprehensible Power of Silence. One growth, the Great Power, the Universal Mind, appears from above, male, ordering all things. The other, the Great Thought (or Conception), female, appears from below, producing all things. They balance each other, unite, and reveal the Middle Space, the incomprehensible Air [Spirit], without beginning or end.
>
> In this air is the second Father who sustains and nourishes all things that have a beginning and an end. This Father has always existed and will always exist, embodying both male and female power, similar to the Boundless Power that has no beginning or end and exists as one. From this Boundless Power, Thought emerged, which had previously been hidden in oneness, and became two.
>
> He, the Boundless, was one; having her within Himself, He was alone. He was not called 'first' even though He pre-existed because it was only when He manifested Himself to Himself that there was a 'second.' He was not called Father until Thought named Him Father.
>
> By producing Himself from Himself, He revealed His own Thought to Himself. Similarly, His manifested Thought did not create the manifested second Father, but instead, hid Him—His power—within herself, embodying both male and female, Power and Thought. Therefore, they are equal, being one, with no difference between Power and Thought. Power is discovered from things above, and Thought from things below.
>
> Thus, what is manifested from them, though one, appears as two, male and female, with the female within itself. Similarly, Mind within Thought is truly one, but when separated, they seem like two.

This summarizes The Great Announcement of "Simon." It is possible that new documents may be found to provide more insight on the subject. For now, we should reserve judgment and consider any claims that "Simon" was the "first-born son of Satan" as irrelevant.

#### Menander

One of the teachers of the "Simonian" Gnosis highlighted by Justin for leading many people away, similar to how Marcion was gaining a huge following during Justin's time, is Menander. Menander was from the Samaritan town of Capparatea. Justin's account shows that Menander was from an earlier generation and was well-known for his many followers.

The dates from this period are very unclear, even for Justin, our earliest source. For example, writing around 150 A.D., Justin says that Jesus lived 150 years before his time. The dates for "Simon" and Menander are just as vague; Menander might have lived one generation or four generations before Justin, or even earlier.

Menander's main area of activity was said to be Antioch, a key commercial and literary city in the Graeco-Roman world, situated on the main route between East and West. He seems to have passed on the main ideas of Gnosis, particularly emphasizing the difference between the supreme God and the creative forces or powers, known as the "forces of nature." He taught that wisdom could be achieved through the practical discipline of transcendental "magic," meaning that Gnosis was not achieved by faith alone but through deliberate effort and conscious striving in cosmological and psychological science.

Menander claimed to teach knowledge of the powers of nature and how they could be controlled by a purified human will. He also claimed to be the Saviour sent by higher spiritual powers to teach people the sacred knowledge needed to free themselves from the control of lower Angels. However, it is almost certain that Menander did not claim to be the Saviour in the Catholic sense, just as "Simon" did not.

The true Saviour was the Logos, as previously mentioned. The Gnostics claimed that a person could perfect themselves to become a conscious worker with the Logos. Those who achieved this were called "Christs" and were seen as Saviors, but not as the Logos itself. When a neophyte received "baptism," meaning they reached a certain level of inner purification or enlightenment, they were said to "rise from the dead." From then on, they "never grew old and became immortal," meaning they attained a continuous awareness of their spiritual self. Menander opposed the materialistic idea of the resurrection of the body, which was a point of contention with later Patristic writers. Menander's followers were called Menandrists, but unfortunately, no records of them or their writings survive.

These followers were likely based in Antioch, as tradition states that Paul founded the Church of Antioch and Peter was its first bishop. The Acts also place the "withstanding to the face" incident in Antioch, suggesting that Menander's writings might have clarified these traditions. I propose that Menander lived much earlier than "Simon" and was one of the first to link Gnosticism with the Magian tradition. The Gnostics likely traced their aeon-lore to Menander, a disciple of the Magi, as the roots of their aeonology are found in the Zoroastrian Amshaspends, the personal emanations of Ahuramazda, as Mills and others have shown. However, I believe the origin of the aeon-doctrine should be sought in Egypt.

#### Saturninus

Saturninus, or more accurately Satornilus, is generally considered the founder of Syrian Gnosticism. However, Gnosticism was likely widespread in Syria before his time. Justin Martyr, writing between 150 and 160, mentions the Satornilians as a significant group, placing them alongside the Marcians (possibly Marcionites), Basilidians, and Valentinians, the major Gnostic schools of his era.

Saturninus, Basilides, and Valentinus lived at least a generation apart from each other, so Saturninus can be placed at the end of the first century and the beginning of the second century. This dating is based on the statements of early Christian writers who claimed that Menander taught Saturninus, Saturninus taught Basilides, and Basilides taught Valentinus. However, it's possible that these claims were made simply because their doctrines were similar, and they might never have actually met.

Saturninus is said to have taught in Antioch, but, as is common with Gnostic teachers, we know little about his nationality or personal life. He was known for his strict asceticism, known as encratism. His followers avoided marriage and all kinds of animal food, and their strict lifestyle attracted many dedicated followers. Salmon says that Saturninus seems to have been the first to introduce encratism "among those who called themselves Christians." Protestant theologians often view encratism as heretical, but there is no strong reason to believe that such a common religious practice started with any specific teacher.

Our knowledge of the Saturninian system is unfortunately very limited. Irenaeus's brief summary is likely based on, or a copy of, the lost Compendium of Justin. This is especially unfortunate because more detailed information might have helped us understand its connections with the "Ophite" and "Barbelo" traditions, and how all three relate to the Gnosticism of Basilides and Valentinus. The main features are similar to those of the "Simonian" and Menandrian Gnosis. However, we should remember that these early systems might have been quite elaborate rather than simple. Just because Irenaeus provides a summary with seemingly simple features doesn't mean the systems themselves weren't detailed and well-developed.

We can consider the bishop of Lyons' summary as a rough outline, like a list of topics without much detail. From this summary, we learn that Saturninus taught about the Unknown Father, the great intermediate hierarchies like archangels, angels, and powers, the seven creative spheres and their rulers, the creators of the universe, and the makers of humans. There were many hostile hierarchies and their rulers, and a plan of salvation where a World-savior, appearing as a man but not truly human, defeats the evil powers and saves those with the light-spark within them from the powers of the creative hierarchies, including the Jewish God Yahweh. The Jewish scriptures were seen as flawed and mistaken, with some prophecies inspired by the creative angels and others by the evil powers.

The most intriguing aspect preserved by Irenaeus is the myth of the creation of humans by the angels, or rather the construction of humans' outer form by the builder hierarchies. The creation of humans happened like this: The Logos showed a bright image to the demiurgic angels, but they couldn't grasp it because it disappeared quickly. They said to each other, "Let's make humans according to this image and likeness." They tried, but the natural forces could only create a weak form that couldn't stand and just crawled on the ground like a worm. Then, out of compassion, a higher power sent a life spark, and this form stood upright. Over time, it developed limbs that became stronger and more defined as generations passed. Thus, the human body evolved, and the true essence of a person, the light-spark, inhabited it. After death, this light-spark returns to its own kind, while the rest of the body dissolves.

This idea of the evolution of early human bodies is similar to theories proposed by various modern writers on theosophic doctrines. Therefore, it's unfortunate that the orthodox views of Irenaeus or his source gave so little attention to Saturninus and his so-called "heresy."

#### The Ophites

The task we now face is the most difficult one for students of Patristic Gnosticism. When we have the name of a specific teacher to guide us, it helps to organize certain ideas and statements around them. However, when we lack such guidance and only have bits of information or vague summaries like those from Irenaeus, or general references to widespread schools from various times as in Hippolytus, it becomes very challenging. Especially, when we consider that we are dealing with the development of Gnosticism without clear landmarks, even the most enthusiastic student might feel discouraged.

It is believed that Gnostic documents were widely circulated up until the time of Irenaeus. By the time of Hippolytus, a generation or more later, orthodoxy had advanced to the point that Gnostic documents were withdrawn and hidden. This could explain why Hippolytus taunted the Gnostics for having some of their secret manuscripts. However, I am convinced that the most complex and technical Gnostic writings were never widely circulated; the followers of Gnosticism were too committed to the idea of a "secret doctrine" and levels of initiation to publicize their core beliefs openly.

Moreover, I doubt that these different schools and phases of doctrine were clearly separated or that groups like the Basilidians and Valentinians identified themselves with such labels. Gnosticism was a dynamic and evolving movement, not a rigid system or dead orthodoxy. Each knowledgeable student developed their own interpretation of Gnosticism and expressed it in their own terms. In addressing this section of our essay, we encounter another challenge. We are writing for readers who likely have only a basic understanding of the subject and might be overwhelmed by too many details. However, these details are crucial and interesting, so a summary will inevitably be incomplete and possibly misunderstood. We must therefore provide guidance as best as we can.

As mentioned earlier, the term "Ophite" is highly misleading. It does not accurately describe the groups we are discussing and was not used by the groups themselves, who preferred the term Gnostic. Even when serpent symbolism appears in their systems, it is not the defining feature. In short, this term arose from the mistake of focusing on a minor aspect and exaggerating it into a defining characteristic, a common tactic among critics who sought to misrepresent these groups. Consequently, "Ophite" has become a vague label for any Gnostic teaching that cannot be attributed to a specific teacher.

It is within this context that we must seek the general principles underlying the teachings of even prominent Gnostics like Basilides and Valentinus, who, like others, adapted the broader tradition in their unique ways. According to Philaster, this "Ophite" Gnosticism existed before Christianity. Irenaeus, after describing a system that Theodoret later copied and called "Ophite," claimed it originated from the Valentinian school. Celsus, a Pagan philosopher writing in the late second century, made no distinction between these groups and the broader Christian community, while Origen, almost a century later, referred to them as "Ophiani" in his critique of Celsus. Recent critics believe that Philaster made a mistake, but this view supports the idea that there was a body of pre-Christian Gnosis. This knowledge grew steadily during the first two centuries and the term "Ophite" still identifies one of its main branches.

The serpent symbol was significant in the ancient mysteries of Greece, Egypt, and Phoenicia, and its origins can be traced back to Syria, Babylonia, and even further to India, where it persists and is well-understood. The serpent represented the creation of the universe and humanity, as well as mystic birth. It symbolized creative power, and at its lowest form, became a phallic symbol.

Physical procreation and conception are lower forms of the great creative will and the evolutionary process. However, they are as different from each other as a human body is from the universe, or human desire from divine will. The secrets of sex were explained in the inner sanctums of ancient temples, and exploring these mysteries came with great risk. Understanding them led some to asceticism, while mere curiosity led to misuse. Purity of body and mind brought enlightenment and spiritual knowledge, while sexual excess and depravity punished the unworthy.

This explains a common phenomenon in religious history: the coexistence of bright and dark sides. Whenever there is an attempt to illuminate the mysteries of the world and humanity, the whole nature is stimulated. If the animalistic side is stronger, it becomes more uncontrolled due to this stimulation.

Some obscure groups dabbling in the mystery traditions made serious mistakes in both theory and practice. Later, Patristic writers exaggerated these mistakes to make a broader accusation of error. However, the Gnostics themselves were the harshest critics of such abuses.

Just as a man is formed in the womb from a "serpent" and an "egg," so was the universe. The universe's serpent was a Great Power, a Mighty Whirlwind, a Vast Vortex, while the egg was the All-Envelope of the world system, the primordial "fire-mist." The serpent symbolized the Divine Will, Divine Reason, the Mind of Deity, the Logos. The egg represented Thought, Conception, the Mother of All. The early universe was depicted as a circle with a serpent either lying diagonally across it or coiled around it.

This serpentine force shaped the universe and humanity. It created man, and man, in turn, could use this force for creation if he ceased from generation. The Caduceus, or Rod of Mercury, and the Thyrsus in the Greek Mysteries, which guided the soul from life to death and back, symbolized this serpentine power in man and the path it would take to elevate him, provided he could make the "Waters of the Jordan" "flow upwards."

Jewish Gnostics quickly associated the serpent in Genesis, Moses' serpent-rod, and the brazen serpent in the wilderness with similar mythological ideas from the Mysteries. To illustrate their methods of mystical interpretation, which focused on inner psychological science, we can present their explanation of what could be called "The Myth of the Going-forth."

The myth was common to several schools, but Hippolytus attributes it to an otherwise unknown school called the Peratae, which is believed to mean Transcendentalists—those who, through Gnosis, had "passed beyond" or "crossed over." They explained the Exodus myth in this way: Egypt represents the body; those who identify with the body are the ignorant, the Egyptians. To "come forth" out of Egypt means to leave the body, and to pass through the Red Sea is to cross over the ocean of generation, the animal and sensual nature hidden within the blood. However, even then, they are not safe; crossing the Red Sea, they enter the Desert, the intermediate state of the doubting lower mind. There, they are attacked by the "gods of destruction," which Moses called the "serpents of the desert," and which plague those who seek to escape from the "gods of generation."

Moses, the teacher, shows them the true serpent crucified on the cross of matter, and through this, they escape the Desert and enter the Promised Land, the realm of the spiritual mind, where there is the Heavenly Jordan, the World-soul. When the Waters of the Jordan flow downwards, humans are generated; but when they flow upwards, gods are created. Jesus (Joshua) was one who had caused the Waters of the Jordan to flow upwards.

Many ancient myths had historical or legendary backgrounds, but their use as myths, or religious and mystical stories, had gradually erased traces of actual history. Those instructed in the Mysteries were skilled in the science of mythology, and thus the learned Gnostics immediately recognized the mythological nature of the Exodus and its suitability for mystical interpretation.

The above example is a very good illustration of this method of interpretation; however, much of such interpretation was exceedingly strained, if not downright silly. The religious mindset of the past enjoyed interpreting religious texts creatively. The main difference between Gnostic and later Orthodox interpretations is that Gnostics tried to find psychological insights in the myths and parables of scripture, while the Orthodox believed only theological and dogmatic interpretations were valid.

By today's standards, the most "ridiculous" aspect of these interpretations was the use of wordplay or pseudo-philology, which appeared in the writings of the Babylonians, Egyptians, Indians, Jews, and Greeks. Among Gnostic and early Christian writers, we find many absurd derivations of names used to support theological beliefs, lacking basic philological accuracy. Even intellectual giants like Plato used these methods. However, it's nice to see that the primary concern of these ancient "philologists" was understanding the soul and spiritual truths, rather than linguistic roots. Despite recognizing the limitations of these ancient methods, we should also acknowledge the limitations of our own modern methods.

#### An Anonymous System From Irenaeus

We will now outline one of the main Gnostic ideas preserved by Irenaeus.

In the Unutterable Depth were two Great Lights: the First Man or Father, and his Son, the Second Man. Additionally, there was the Holy Spirit, the First Woman or Mother of all living. Below this triad was a sluggish mass made up of the four great "elements": Water, Darkness, Abyss, and Chaos.

The Universal Mother watched over the Waters. Admiring her beauty, the First and Second Man created the third Great Light, the Christ. He ascended and, with the First and Second Man, formed the Holy Church. This was the right-hand creation of the Great Mother. However, a Drop of Light fell to the left into chaotic matter, known as Sophia, or Wisdom, the World-Mother. The Waters of the Aether began to move and created a body for Sophia, which became the Heaven-sphere.

Sophia freed herself, left her body behind, and ascended to the Middle Region below her Mother, the Universal Mother, who marked the boundary of the Ideal Universe. By merely touching the Space-Waters, she generated a son, the chief Creative Power of the Sensible World, who retained some Light-fluid. This son was Ialdabaoth (interpreted by some as the Child of Chaos), who produced a son, and he another, until there were seven in total, the great Formative Powers of the Sensible Universe. They were "fighters" and often quarreled with their fathers.

Through this interplay of forces on matter, "mind," "spirit," "soul," and all things in the world came into being. Ialdabaoth was boastful and declared, "I am Father and God, and there is none above me." But Sophia rebuked him, saying, "Do not lie, Ialdabaoth, for above you is the Father of All, the First Man, and Man the Son of Man."

All the Powers were amazed at her words, but Ialdabaoth, to divert their attention, said, "Let us make 'man' in our image." So they created "man," who lay lifeless on the ground until they brought him to Ialdabaoth. He breathed into him the "breath of life," which was the Light-fluid he had received from Sophia, thereby emptying himself of his Light.

The man, upon receiving it, immediately thanked the First Man and ignored his creators (the Elohim). This made Ialdabaoth (Yahweh) jealous, and he planned to take away Adam's Light-spark by creating "woman." The six creative powers were infatuated with Eve and had children with her, who became the angels. As a result, Adam fell under the control of Ialdabaoth and the Elohim again. Then Sophia, or Wisdom, sent the "serpent" (representing "mind") into Ialdabaoth's Paradise, and Adam and Eve listened to its wise advice. This freed "man" from the control of the Creative Power and defied Ialdabaoth's rule of ignorance.

Ialdabaoth then expelled them from his Paradise, along with the "serpent" or "mind." However, Sophia prevented the Light-spark from descending to avoid its corruption. The "serpent" (the lower mind), the first creation of Ialdabaoth, had six sons, who became the "daemonial" powers that torment humans because their father was cast down for their sake.

Before their fall, Adam and Eve had spiritual bodies like the angels born from Eve. After their fall from Ialdabaoth's Paradise, their bodies became more dense and sluggish, becoming "coats of skin." Eventually, Sophia, in her compassion, restored the sweet scent of the Light to them, and they realized they carried death within them. This reminded them of their former state, and they became patient, understanding that their physical bodies were temporary.

The system then attempts to address the legends of Genesis regarding Cain, Noah, and other Old Testament stories with moderate success. The main idea is that the prophets were inspired by one of the seven Elohim, although occasionally Sophia managed to give them partial revelations about the First Man and the higher Christ.

The rest of the system focuses on the plan of regeneration and the interpretation of Mystery-myths. Sophia, or Wisdom, unable to find peace in heaven or earth, asked the Great Mother for help. The Great Mother compassionately asked the First Man to send Christ to assist her. Knowing her brother and spouse was coming to help, Sophia announced his arrival through John. Through the "baptism of repentance," Jesus was prepared as a pure vessel to receive him. Christ then descended through the seven spheres, taking on the appearance of the Rulers and absorbing their power, reclaiming the Light they held.

First, Christ clothed his sister Sophia in the Light-vesture, and they celebrated together in a mystical "marriage" of the "bridegroom and the bride." Jesus, born of a "virgin" through God's work (symbolizing the spiritual "second birth" achieved by the ascetic Jesus), was then joined by Christ and Sophia, becoming Jesus Christ. He began performing miracles, healing, proclaiming the Unknown Father, and openly declaring himself the Son of the First Man. The Powers, especially Ialdabaoth, sought to kill him. Consequently, Jesus, the man, was "crucified" by them, but Christ and Sophia ascended to the Incorruptible Aeon.

But Christ did not forget the one in whom He had dwelled. He sent a power that raised up his body, not his physical body, but a psychic and spiritual one. Some of his disciples saw this body and thought he had risen in his physical form. However, to those who could understand, he explained the mystery and taught them many other spiritual truths. Jesus now sits at the right hand of his father, Ialdabaoth, and receives the souls who have learned these mysteries. As he gathers more souls, Ialdabaoth loses power and can no longer send holy souls back into the world for reincarnation, only those of his own kind. The end of all things will come when all the Light is once again gathered and stored in the treasures of the Incorruptible Aeon.

This account, despite being preserved in a rough Latin translation of Irenaeus' summary, is not absurd. The original system was likely much more complex, judging from Irenaeus' habit of making brief summaries of the beliefs he criticized. The main ideas about Christ and salvation in this system are similar to those in the Pistis Sophia and one of the treatises of the Codex Brucianus. This suggests that these writings might not be later than the time of Irenaeus, but further discussion on this needs to be reserved for later. It is also interesting to note the influence of Orphic, Pythagorean, Platonic, and Hermetic traditions in the cosmological part, and to see how both Hellenic and Jewish myths share common elements with Chaldaean tradition.

#### An Early Ophite System

Hippolytus dedicates the fifth book of his "Refutation" to the "Ophites," although they actually refer to themselves as followers of Gnosis, not "Ophites." He believes they represent the oldest branch of Gnosis. After discussing three major schools of thought, which we will address later, he focuses on a man named Justinus, who isn't mentioned by any other heresy scholars.

This makes Hippolytus's account particularly valuable since Justinus's system seems to be one of the earliest forms of Gnosis we know about. Salmon has questioned this, but I find his arguments unconvincing. The Justinian school’s mystical interpretations don't reference New Testament texts, even though they quote the Old Testament extensively, which supports this point. They attribute one short saying to Jesus, but it’s not found in the canonical texts.

This group had a significant body of literature, and Hippolytus highlights one book, "The Book of Baruch," as the most comprehensive representation of their beliefs. Members took an oath of secrecy about their teachings, and the oath's wording is provided. Their creation story is based on a Syrian myth, a version of which Herodotus preserved. In this myth, Hercules, the Sun-god, plays a key role, and elements of it appear in Genesis. The myth closely relates to Chaldean and ancient Semitic traditions.

Here’s a summary of their system:

The Universe has three principles: (1) The Good, or all-wise Deity; (2) the Father, or Spirit, the creative power, called Elohim; and (3) the World-Soul, symbolized as a woman above the middle and a serpent below, called Eden. From Elohim (a collective term) and Eden, twenty-four cosmic powers or angels emerge—twelve follow the will of the Father-Spirit, and twelve follow the nature of the Mother-Soul. The lower twelve are known as the World-Trees of the Garden of Eden. These Trees are divided into four groups of three, representing the four Rivers of Eden. These Trees are similar to the cosmic forces described by Hindus, which have their roots above and their branches or streams below. The name Eden means Pleasure or Desire. This is how all creation comes into existence: animals are generated from the animal part of the Mother-Soul, and humans from the human part. The upper part of the Garden is called the "most beautiful Earth," or Cosmic Earth, and the body of man is formed from the finest elements.

Once man is formed, Eden and Elohim delegate their powers to him; the World-Soul gives him a soul, and the World-Spirit infuses him with spirit. This is how men and women are created. All creation is governed by the four groups of twelve powers of the World-Soul, according to their cycles, moving in a circular dance.

When humanity reached its peak, the turning point of the world process, Elohim, the Spirit, ascended to the celestial spaces, taking his twelve powers with him. In the highest part of heaven, he saw the Great Light shining through the Gate (possibly the physical sun), leading to the Light-world of The Good. Realizing there was one above him, he cried out: "Open the gates so I may acknowledge the true Lord; for I thought I was the Lord." A voice responded: "This is the Gate of the Lord; through this, the righteous enter." Leaving his angels in the highest part of the heavens, the World-Father entered and sat at the right hand of the Good One.

God wanted to forcibly reclaim his spirit, which was tied to humans, to prevent further corruption. However, the Good Deity stopped him because now that he had risen to the realm of light, he could no longer cause destruction. The Soul, feeling abandoned by God, tried to attract him back, but the Spirit refused to return to Mother Nature since evolution had progressed too far. Consequently, the spirit left in humans was tormented by the soul. The spirit wished to follow its Father to higher realms, but the soul, influenced by Mother Nature's powers—particularly those governing sexual desire and excess—engaged in immoral acts, causing the spirit distress.

The angel or power of the World-Soul that especially encouraged such misdeeds in the human soul was Naas (Hebrew for serpent), symbolizing animal passion. Seeing this, God sent his third angel, Baruch, to help the spirit in humans. Baruch stood among the Trees (powers of the World-Soul) and told humans they could eat from any tree in the Garden of Eden except the Tree of Naas, which had broken the law and led to adultery and unnatural acts.

Baruch also appeared to Moses and the prophets through the human spirit to guide people towards goodness. However, Naas consistently obscured Baruch's teachings through the human soul. Baruch instructed not only Hebrew prophets but also those of other nations. For example, Hercules among the Syrians was taught by Baruch, and his twelve labors represented his battles against the twelve powers of the World-Soul. Hercules ultimately failed too; after seemingly completing his labors, he was overpowered by Omphale, or Venus, who stripped him of his strength by dressing him in her own attire, symbolizing the power of the earthly realm.

Finally, Baruch appeared to Jesus, a twelve-year-old shepherd boy, the son of Joseph and Mary. Jesus stayed true to Baruch's teachings, despite Naas's temptations. In anger, Naas had Jesus "crucified," but Jesus left behind his earthly and psychic bodies on the "tree" and entrusted his spirit to his Father (Elohim), ascending to the Good One. There, he witnessed things unseen and unheard by humans and immersed himself in the life-giving waters, no longer the waters of earthly generation, which represent the cycle of rebirth found in Brahmanical and Buddhist traditions.

Hippolytus criticizes Justinus, accusing him of being vile for highlighting the obstacles to spiritual life and the horrors of animal sensuality. However, Justinus likely preached strict asceticism and attributed Jesus's success to his purity.

#### The Naasseni

Before discussing Justinus, Hippolytus examines three groups: the Naasseni, Peratae, and Sethians or Sithians. These groups seem to belong to the same tradition, with the Naasseni and Peratae showing such similarities that it is likely their works, quoted by Hippolytus, come from the same Gnostic circle. The Naassenes were named after the Hebrew word "Nachash," meaning serpent, but Hippolytus referred to them as Gnostics, not Ophites. He reserved the name Ophite for a small group he called Cainites or Nochaitae, which he did not consider significant enough to discuss further.

The Naassenes had many books and regarded the following scriptures as authoritative: The Gospel of Perfection, The Gospel of Eve, The Questions of Mary, Concerning the Offspring of Mary, The Gospel of Philip, The Gospel according to Thomas, and The Gospel according to the Egyptians. Hippolytus came into possession of one of their manuscripts, which was more focused on mystical, psychological, devotional, and interpretative matters rather than cosmology, making it hard to understand from Hippolytus' quotes.

Upon analysis, the Naassene Document appears to be a Christian adaptation of a Jewish adaptation of a Pagan commentary on a Hymn of the Mysteries. The Christian writer likely worked on it around the middle of the second century. This document is valuable for showing the similarities between Gnostic Christian teachings and the beliefs of various ancient Mysteries—Phrygian, Eleusinian, Dionysian, Samothracian, Egyptian, Assyrian, and others. The Christian writer claimed their tradition was passed down from James to a person named Mariamne. This Mariamne, or Mary, is somewhat puzzling to scholars, but it seems likely that the treatise belonged to the same tradition as The Greater and Lesser Questions of Mary, The Gospel of Mary, and others, in which the Pistis Sophia treatise is also included.

The main features of the system are that the cosmos is symbolized as the Heavenly Man, who is both male and female, and has three natures: spiritual, psychic, and material. These three natures were perfectly embodied in Jesus, making him truly the Son of Man. Humanity is divided into three groups based on which nature dominates: the spiritual (the elect), the psychic (the called), and the material (the bound).

After this brief overview, Hippolytus delves into the mystical interpretations of the writer and their understanding of the Mysteries, which includes some wordplay reminiscent of Plato's Cratylus. The system is believed to be the foundation of all mythologies—Pagan, Jewish, and Christian. It reflects the ancient teaching of the macrocosm and microcosm, and the hidden Self within everyone. Due to the technical nature of this interpretation, we can only provide a brief summary of the main ideas, but the subject is significant enough to warrant a detailed study.

The spirit or mind of man is trapped in the soul, which is his animal nature, and the soul is trapped in the body. The nature and evolution of this soul were discussed in The Gospel according to the Egyptians, a now-lost work. The Assyrians, following the Chaldaeans and Egyptians (seen by antiquity as the most sacred nations), first taught that man is both threefold and a unity. The soul is the principle of desire, and everything has a soul, even stones, for they grow and diminish.

The true "man" is male-female and sexless, striving to leave the animal nature behind and return to the eternal essence above, where there is neither male nor female, but a new being. Baptism wasn't just a symbolic washing with water; it was a spiritual cleansing with the "living water above," representing the eternal world beyond the cycle of life and death. The anointing with oil symbolized the candidate's entry into everlasting happiness, thus becoming a Christ.

The kingdom of heaven is to be found within a person; it is the "blessed nature of all things past, present, and future," mentioned in the Phrygian Mysteries. It pertains to the spirit or mind, as indicated in The Gospel according to Thomas: "He who seeks me shall find me in children from the age of seven years," representing the divine reason within man. In Egyptian belief, Osiris represents the Water of Life, or Spirit, while Isis is depicted as "seven-robed nature," which transforms the ineffable mother-substance through the cycles of nature.

The Mind, or Self, creates everything but remains unchanged, as expressed in the saying: "I become what I will, and I am what I am; therefore, I say, the ruler of all is unmovable. For He remains what He is, creating things but is not of the things created." This is also called The Good, hence the phrase: "Why callest thou Me Good? Only One is Good, My Father in the heavens..."

In Greek mythology, Hermes represents the divine reason. He guides and leads souls, bringing them from the heavenly realm into the physical body, making them servants to the creator of the world, the passionate god of creation. Thus, Hermes "holds a beautiful, golden rod that can put men to sleep and wake them again." Hence the saying: "Wake up, sleeper, rise, and Christ shall give you light." This is Christ, the Son of Man, present in everyone who is born; this was symbolized in the Eleusinian rites.

This is also Ocean, representing "the generation of gods and men," the Great Jordan, as explained in the Myth of the Going-forth mentioned earlier. The Samothracians taught the same truth, showing two statues in their temple of Mysteries: one representing the Heavenly Man and the other the spiritual man, both fundamentally the same as that Man. Christ was like this, but His disciples had not yet reached perfection. Thus the saying: "If you do not drink My blood and eat My flesh, you will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven; but even if you drink from My cup, you cannot follow Me where I go." The Gnostic writer adds: "For He knew the nature of each of His disciples and that each must follow his own path. He chose twelve disciples from the twelve tribes, and spoke to each tribe through them. That's why not everyone has listened to the preaching of the twelve disciples, nor can everyone who listens accept it."

The text then refers to the mysteries of the Thracians and Phrygians and explains similar ideas from the Old Testament. Jacob's vision is interpreted as the spirit's descent into matter, down the ladder of evolution, with the Logos flowing downward and then upward again through the Gate of the Lord. Hence the saying: "I am the true gate." The Phrygians also called the spirit in man "dead" because it was buried in the body. Hence the saying: "You are whitened sepulchres, filled with the bones of the dead," meaning "the living man is not in you." And again: "The dead shall rise from the tombs," meaning "from their material bodies, becoming regenerated spiritual men, not carnal." This is the resurrection that happens through the gate of the heavens. Those who don’t pass through it remain dead."

Many similar interpretations are given, showing that the Lesser Mysteries involved physical birth, while the Greater Mysteries dealt with spiritual rebirth. "This is the Gate of Heaven and the House of God, where the Good God lives alone. No impure person, no one driven by worldly desires or physical needs, can enter. Only the spiritual can come here, casting off their old selves and becoming pure, like bridegrooms made virgin by the Virginal Spirit. Such a person is like a virgin who conceives and gives birth to a son, who is not bound by worldly or physical nature but is a blessed eternal being. This is the Kingdom of Heaven, the 'mustard seed,' the indivisible point, the primeval spark within the body, known only to the spiritual."

The Naasseni school said they were all initiated into the Mysteries of the Great Mother because these rites taught the whole mystery of rebirth. They were also strict ascetics. The name Naasseni was given to them because they symbolized the "Moist Essence" of the universe, which holds everything together, whether living or non-living, immortal or mortal, using the symbol of a serpent. This essence is like the cosmic Akasha of the Upanishads and the Kundalini, the serpentine force in humans. When driven by animal impulses, it is the force of generation, but when directed toward spiritual things, it transforms a person into a god. It is like the Waters of the Great Jordan flowing downwards (the generation of men) and upwards (the generation of gods), the Akasha-ganga or Heavenly Ganges of the Puranas, the Heavenly Nile of mystical Egypt. "He distributes beauty and bloom to all, just like the river flowing out of Eden and dividing into four streams."

In humans, they said, Eden represents the brain, "enclosed by surrounding ventures like the heavens," and Paradise refers to humans up to the head. The four streams are sight, hearing, smell, and taste. The river symbolizes the "water above the body." In other symbolic terms, "the spiritual choose for themselves from the living waters of the Euphrates [the subtle world], which flows through the midst of Babylon [the physical body], what is fitting, passing through the gate of truth, which is Jesus, the blessed," meaning the "gate of the heavens," or the sun, cosmically; and microcosmically, the conscious passage out of the body through the highest center in the head, which Hindu mystics call the Brahmarandhra. Thus, these Gnostics considered themselves the true Christians because they were anointed with the "ineffable chrism," poured out by the serpentine "horn of plenty," another symbol for the spiritual power of enlightenment.

We will end this brief overview of these intriguing mystics by quoting one of their hymns. The text is unfortunately so corrupted that parts of it are hopeless, but enough remains to grasp the thought. It speaks of the World-Mind, the Father, of Chaos, the Cosmic Mother, and the third member of the primordial trinity, the World-Soul. From there, the individual soul, the pilgrim, and its sorrows and rebirth. Finally, the descent of the Savior, the firstborn of the Great Mind, and the regeneration of all. Behind all is the Ineffable, then comes first the First-born, the Logos:

> Mind was the first, the generative law of all;
>
> Second was Chaos diffused, [spouse] of the first-born;
>
> Thirdly, the toiling Soul received the law;
>
> Wherefore surrounded with a watery form
>
> It weary grows, subdued by death. . . . Now holding sway, it sees the light;
>
> Anon, cast into piteous plight, it weeps. While it weeps, it rejoices;
>
> Now wails and is judged;
>
> And now is judged and dies.
>
> And now it cannot pass . . . .
>
> Into the labyrinth of rebirth, it has wandered.
>
> Jesus said: "Father,
>
> searching for evil on earth
>
> makes man stray from Your Spirit.
>
> He tries to avoid the bitter Chaos
>
> but doesn't know how.
>
> So, send me, Father!
>
> With seals in my hands,
>
> I will descend through every aeon.
>
> I will reveal all mysteries
>
> and show the forms of gods.
>
> The hidden secrets of the Holy Path
>
> will be called Gnosis,
>
> and I will pass them on.

#### The Peratae

Hippolytus says that the mysteries symbolized by the serpent are at the core of all Gnosticism. Although he doesn't fully understand these mysteries, as shown by his comments, we agree with him, as we have tried to explain. He then discusses the Peratae, whose Mysteries (which he calls "blasphemy against Christ") had been kept secret for many years. Other sources tell us that this school existed before Clement of Alexandria.

The Peratae's system was based on sidereal considerations and the ancient Chaldaean star-cult tradition. In Book IV, Hippolytus tried to refute the Chaldaean system of the star-spheres. While he made some good points against the common astrology of the time, he didn't affect the mysterious doctrine of the septenary spheres, whose secret the empirical astrologers had long lost and replaced with the physical planets.

Hippolytus focused on the Peratic school in his critique of astrologers and mathematicians. He admitted he had no practical knowledge of these fields but directed readers to the fourth book of his "Philosophumena" for an overview of astrology from a Church perspective. According to the Peratic school, the universe was symbolized by a circle enclosing a triangle. The triangle represented three primary divisions: the ingenerable, self-generable, and generable worlds.

They believed in three aspects of the Logos, or three Gods, Logoi, Minds, or Men. When the world-process was complete, the Saviour descended from the ingenerable world, embodying a perfected man with a threefold nature, body, and power, encompassing all potentialities from the three divisions of the universe. This aligns with the Pauline phrase: "It pleased Him that in him should dwell all fullness (pleroma) bodily." The seeds of all potentialities come from the ingenerable and self-generable worlds into the generable world.

Hippolytus then mentions the founders of the Peratic school: a certain Euphrates (whom Origen identified as the founder of the Ophites mentioned by Celsus around 175 A.D.) and Celbes, also referred to as Acembes and Ademes. He goes on to discuss Chaldaean art and indicates that he will quote various Peratic treatises to show similarities with Chaldaean ideas.

The Savior has both a human and a cosmic task to perform. The cosmic task involves separating the good from the bad among the celestial powers and influences. This aspect of salvation is also highlighted in the Pistis Sophia treatise, which we will discuss later. The "wars in heaven" come before the battle between good and evil on earth. The text that Hippolytus quotes from is clearly a Gnostic commentary on an ancient Babylonian or Syrian creation story, which the commentator tries to explain using Greek mythology. The beginning of this mysterious treatise reads:

> I am the voice awakening from sleep in the world of night. Now, I begin to expose the power that comes from Chaos. It is the power of the deep slime, which raises the clay of the imperishable vast moist principle, the whole force of the water-colored convulsion, always moving, supporting the steady, and checking the unsteady. It is the faithful steward of the path of the aethers, rejoicing in what streams forth from the twelve founts of the Law, the power that takes its form from the impression of the invisible waters above.

This power is called Thalassa, evidently the Thalatth (Tiamat), or World-Mother, of the Babylonians. The twelve sources are also called twelve mouths or pipes through which the world-powers pour hissing. This power is surrounded by a twelve-sided pyramid, or dodecahedron, which should prompt astrologers to reconsider their "signs of the zodiac."

Hippolytus' quotations and summary here are very unclear and need a detailed analysis that has not been done yet. He tells us that the information comes from a treatise about the formal or generative world, called "The Proasteioi up to the Aether." This means the hierarchies of powers up to the aether, likely shown in diagrams with concentric circles—"proasteion" refers to the space around a city's walls. Hippolytus notes the similarity between astrological symbolism and the teachings of this Gnostic school, calling it astrology turned into allegory, or more accurately, cosmogony turned into theology.

The Peratics, or Transcendentalists, get their name from their beliefs. They think that nothing created can survive destruction, making the sphere of creation also the sphere of fate. Anyone who knows nothing beyond this is stuck in the cycle of fate. However, someone who understands the compulsion of creation (samsara) and the paths through which humans enter the generative world can move through and transcend destruction. This destruction is symbolized by "Water," which represents human generation and the element where generative hierarchies exist. It is called water because of its color, the lower ether.

The treatise Hippolytus quotes also delves deeply into mythology, discussing the Myth of the Going-forth and its mystical interpretation. The Gnostic commentator explains the opening verses of the prologue to the fourth canonical Gospel. However, Hippolytus becomes increasingly confused by the complexity of the system and stops, apparently moving on to another treatise to quote from.

The new treatise is highly mystical and seems to discuss the psychological physiology of the school. It describes the universe as having three parts: Father, Son, and Matter (Hyle), each with infinite potential. The Son, or fashioning Logos, is positioned between the immovable Father and the moving Matter. At times, the Son faces the Father to receive powers, which he then casts into the formless Matter, shaping it into the structured world. This reflects an attempt to combine higher teachings, similar to Plato's doctrine of forms and ideas, with early interpretations of natural phenomena.

In this symbolism, the sun represents the Father, the moon represents the Son, and the earth represents Matter. The moon is depicted as a serpent due to its winding path, and its phases are seen as it turning its face towards the sun and then towards the earth. If this interpretation is correct, the understanding of the sun’s immobility and the earth's motion suggests that the Chaldaeans had better astronomical knowledge than the followers of the later geocentric model proposed by Hipparchus and Ptolemy.

The Gnostic writer also presents a correct theory of magnetic and other influences in a quaint manner. We can identify three levels of interpretation: (1) metaphysical and spiritual—the ideal world, the intermediate, and the visible universe; (2) the world of generation—with its sun, moon, and earth forces; and (3) the analogous psycho-physiological processes in humans. The last is explained as follows: the brain is the Father, the cerebellum is the Son, and the medulla is Matter or Hyle. "The cerebellum, through an ineffable and inscrutable process, attracts the spiritual and life-giving essence through the pineal gland from the vaulted chamber (possibly the third ventricle). Upon receiving this, the cerebellum, in an indescribable way, imparts 'ideas' to Matter, similar to how the Son does.

In other words, the seeds and types of things created physically flow into the spinal cord. Hippolytus adds that the main secrets of the school depend on understanding these correspondences, but he finds it impious to say anything more on the matter—a surprising hesitation for a Church Father, especially Hippolytus, who dedicated the second and third books of his *Refutation* to explaining the Mysteries.

Interestingly, these two books have been completely removed from the manuscript. Did Hippolytus reveal too much about the early appropriation of Church rites and doctrines, leading later individuals to consider it unwise to keep such evidence? One might expect that the orthodox Fathers would have been eager to display such information to heathens and heretics, and would have ensured these books were preserved. It is quite odd that this most important *Refutation* among all heresiological documents was ignored by Hippolytus's successors. The only known manuscript was brought from Mount Athos in 1842, and its contents, due to numerous direct quotations, have significantly changed our understanding of Gnosticism. Had the two books on the Mysteries been preserved, our ideas might have been even more radically transformed.

#### The Sethians

The Sethians are closely connected with the Gnostics previously described, and Hippolytus next focuses his attention on them. He talks about their countless commentaries and directs his readers to a specific work called "The Paraphrase of Seth" for a summary of their beliefs. However, it's unclear whether Hippolytus is quoting from this document or from different texts. The title "Paraphrase of Seth" is very confusing; it's hard to determine the exact meaning of "paraphrase," and the teachings Hippolytus describes don't seem to relate to the Seth-legend.

The term "Sethians," as used by Hippolytus, is confusing because his summary is completely different from the bits of information on the Sethite system mentioned in his lost Syntagma, which were connected to the doctrine of the Nicolaitans by those who condensed his work. In those fragments, Seth was seen as a symbol of the good man, the perfect one, and a prototype of Christ. Could there be a link between the name "Seth" and the mysterious "Setheus" from the Codex Brucianus? Additionally, should we trace the origin of the Sethians to the Egyptian tradition of the Hyksos-cult, where Seth was considered a Mystery-God due to its Semitic roots?

The Sethians we are discussing start with a trinity: Light, Spirit, and Darkness. The Spirit is not to be thought of as wind or breath, but rather as a subtle fragrance that spreads everywhere. These three principles are intermingled with one another. Darkness tries to keep the Light and Spirit and trap the light sparks in matter, while the Light and Spirit strive to elevate their powers and free them from Darkness. Everything, including all genera, species, individuals, and even heaven and earth, are images of "seals" created according to pre-existing types.

From the initial combination of the three primary elements, the first major form was created: heaven and earth. This is represented by the world-egg in the universe's womb, and the rest of creation follows the same pattern. The egg is in the waters, which are stirred into waves by the creative force. The nature of these waves determines the various creatures that will emerge. This demonstrates the whole theory of vibrations and the concept of the germ cell in action. Into the bodies formed by the waves of water (vehicles of subtle matter), the spark of light and the essence of the Spirit descend, thereby shaping "mind or man" into different species.

This spark is a perfect god, coming from the uncreated Light above and the Spirit, descending into the natural man like a shrine, carried by nature's tide and the motion of the wind (the creative force causing the waves). A tiny spark, a fragment from above, like a star's ray, mixes with the various bodies of subtle matter. Every thought and concern of the Light from above aims to free the mind from death—the dark, evil body—and from the "father" below, the wind, which stirred the waves and eventually produced a perfect mind, its own son, but not of its essence. This mind, a ray from the perfect Light above, is overwhelmed in the dark, fearful, bitter, and blood-stained water; it is also a light-spirit floating on the water.

The generative power is called not only "wind," but also "beast" and "serpent," the latter due to the hissing sound it makes, similar to the whirling wind. The impure womb, or sphere of generation, can only produce mortal humans, while the pure womb, or Sphere of Light, can produce immortal beings or gods. It is the descent of the Perfect Man or Logos into the pure man that can ease the birth-pangs of the carnal man. This natural and spiritual process is demonstrated in the Mysteries. After going through the Lesser Mysteries, which concern the cycle of generation, the candidate is washed or baptized. Then, shedding the clothing of a servant, he puts on a heavenly garment and drinks from the cup of life-giving water. This means he leaves his servile form — the body bound by the necessity of generation — and ascends in his spiritual body to the state of immortality.

The Sethian school supported their beliefs with analogies from natural philosophy and allegorical interpretations of the Old Testament. However, Hippolytus said their system is essentially the teachings of the Orphic Mysteries, celebrated in Achaea at Phlium, long before the Eleusinian Mysteries. The Sethians likely based their theories on one or more traditions of the Mystery cults, but we shouldn't limit ourselves to Hippolytus's narrow interpretation, which focused on a crude and ignorant phase of vulgar phallicism.

The school also seemed to align with the Hermetic tradition, using analogies from natural and "alchemical" processes to explain spiritual matters. For example, one of their books describes how the human soul (light-ray), mixed with the animal soul (water), through discipline and instruction, seeks its proper place. It then hastens towards the divine soul (Logos) that descends in a physical body, and together with the Logos, returns to where the Logos resides, faster than iron is drawn to a magnet.

#### The Docetae

As previously mentioned, the remnants of the ancient Gnostic teachings we are trying to explore are so incomplete that we can only create a very rough outline, or rather a series of sketches of certain sections. One day, further discoveries might allow us to piece these together into a coherent map. We lack chronological details, so we cannot determine the correct sequence of these Gnostic schools. Therefore, we must proceed somewhat randomly and now focus on a school that Hippolytus (Book viii) calls the Docetae, whose beliefs are very similar to those of the three schools we just discussed.

There is no clear reason why this name was chosen, except for the vague explanation that it comes from these Gnostics' attempts to theorize about "inaccessible and incomprehensible matter." It is possible they believed in the non-reality of matter, and that the name Docetae ("Illusionists") is similarly derived to the Maya-vadins of the Hindus. The system of this Gnostic group closely resembles the doctrines of the Basilidian and Valentinian schools. However, the belief in the non-physical nature of Christ's body, which is generally characteristic of typical Docetism, is not more prominent in this group than in many other schools.

Hippolytus provides the following outline of their beliefs. The Primal Being is symbolized as the seed of a fig tree, a mathematical point that is everywhere, smaller than small yet greater than great, containing infinite potentialities within itself. He is the "refuge of the [?], the covering of the naked," and much else, as allegorically described in the Scriptures. The infinite generation of things can be illustrated by a fig tree. From a seed, the stem grows, then branches, leaves, and finally fruit, which contains more seeds. These seeds then grow into new stems, continuing the cycle infinitely. This is how all things come into being.

Before the physical world existed, there was an emanation of a divine or ideal world made up of three main aeons, each consisting of many sub-aeons, both male and female. These aeons represent worlds, beings, or planes with self-generating powers. This ideal world of Light emerged from the original seed or root of the universe, which is the uncreated source.

The collective self-generating aeons produced from the One Virgin (the ideal cosmic substance) the Only-begotten one, the Saviour of the universe. This Saviour, the perfect aeon, contained all the powers of the ideal world of the aeons and was equal in power to the seed of the universe, the uncreated source. Thus, the Saviour of the ideal universe was produced, perfect in all respects. Everything in that spiritual world was perfected, free from all deficiencies and transcending intellect.

This completed the eternal and ideal world-process within the aeons. Regarding the emanation of the ideal world into the physical universe, the third root-aeon divided into three, containing all the supernal potentialities. Its Light then shone upon the primordial chaotic substance, infusing it with the souls of all living beings. When the third aeon, or Logos, saw that its ideas, impressions, and souls were being consumed by darkness, it separated the light from the darkness and placed a firmament between them. However, this separation only occurred after all the infinite species of the third aeon had been intercepted by the darkness.

Lastly, the image of the third aeon was imprinted on the lower universe. This image is a "life-giving fire, created from the light." This fire is the creative god that shapes the world, similar to the story in the Bible. This creator god, having no substance of his own, uses darkness (coarse matter) as his material to make bodies, continually mistreating the eternal qualities of light trapped in the darkness. Until the coming of the Savior, there was a great deception of souls, as these "ideas" are called souls (psyxai) because they were breathed out (apopsygeisai) from the aeons above. These souls live in darkness, moving from one body to another under the control of the creative power or world-maker.

The Gnostic author supports this by referring to the saying: "And if you are willing to accept it, this is Elias who was to come; he who has ears to hear, let him hear"; and also to Job 2:9: "And I am a wanderer, moving from place to place and house to house." This passage is found in the Septuagint version but is omitted in the English translation. Through the Savior, souls are freed from the cycle of rebirth (metensomatosis), and people are inspired to believe that their sins can be forgiven. Therefore, the Only-begotten Son, seeing the soul's tragedy—the "images" of the higher aeons continually moving from one body to another in the darkness—decided to come down for their rescue.

The individual aeons above could not bear the full presence of the divine world, i.e., the Son; if they had seen it, they would have been overwhelmed by its greatness and power, and would have feared for their existence. The Saviour withdrew His glory into Himself, like the brightest lightning into the smallest space, or like the sudden darkness when you close your eyes. He then descended to the heavens, where He withdrew His glory again upon reaching the stars, as even the smallest star is a sun that lights up space. He continued to withdraw His glory and entered the third sphere of the third aeon. Eventually, He entered into darkness, meaning He took on a physical body.

His baptism happened like this: He washed Himself in the Jordan River (symbolizing the stream of the Logos). After this purification, He gained a spiritual body that mirrored His virgin-born physical body. When the world-ruler (the god of generation) condemned His physical body to death on the cross, the spiritual body, nurtured within the physical one, could shed the physical body and overcome the world-ruler's powers. This way, Christ would not be left without a body; He would instead wear His perfected spiritual body rather than another fleshly one. This aligns with the saying: "Unless a man is born of water and Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of heaven; what is born of the flesh is flesh."

The Gnostic writer wisely notes that the understanding of Jesus Christ varies, with different schools having different perspectives, some higher and some lower. This diversity is natural. Only true Gnostics, those who have undergone similar initiations as Jesus, can fully understand the mystery directly. It seems unnecessary to point out to students of Gnosticism the clear similarities between this system and the main ideas in the Bruce and Askew Codices, yet no one has noted them before.

#### Monoimus

Hippolytus dedicates his next section to Monoimus, who is only mentioned by one other heresy writer, Theodoret, in a brief paragraph. Monoimus was an Arabian who lived in the latter half of the second century. His system revolves around the concept of the Heavenly Man, the universe, and the Son of this Man, the perfect man, with all other men being imperfect reflections of this ideal type. His ideas fit into the cycle of Gnostic literature we are examining and are detailed with many mathematical and geometrical ideas from Pythagorean and Platonic traditions.

He develops the theory of numbers and the geometric composition of the universe using the five Platonic solids: the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron. All these geometric symbols originate from the monad, which he calls the iota, the yod, and the "one horn." This refers to the serpentine force, the horn of plenty, the rod of Moses and Hermes; essentially, it is the atom, described by seers as a "conical" swirl of forces. This monad, represented numerically, is the decad, the perfect number and completion of the first series of numbers, after which the entire process starts again. According to the myth, Moses' rod brought about the plagues of Egypt. These "plagues" are actually the transformations of physical matter, like water into blood, which the writer explains in a detailed and interesting manner.

This entire system brings up several important considerations that go beyond the scope of this essay. Monoimus was likely a contemporary of the Valentinian school or perhaps even a student of Valentinus. The distorted version of his system, as preserved by Hippolytus, can reveal many key points that shed light on the "theological arithmetic" of the Gnostic scholars. Someday, this knowledge might grow into significant mathematical understanding. We will conclude our summary of Monoimus's beliefs by quoting his thoughts on how to seek God. In a letter to Theophrastus, he writes:

> Stop seeking God outside yourself, or in the universe, or in similar things. Seek Him within yourself and understand who it is that encompasses everything in you and says: 'My god, my mind, my reason, my soul, my body.' Understand where sorrow and joy come from, love and hate, waking when you don’t want to, sleeping when you don’t want to, getting angry when you don’t want to, and falling in love when you don’t want to. If you closely examine these things, you will find Him within yourself, as one and many, just like an atom. By finding this within yourself, you will find a way out of yourself.

This idea strongly echoes the teachings of earlier Trismegistic literature.

#### The So-Called Cainites

Before returning to the origins along another tradition, of which only a few obscure traces remain—the Carpocrates-Cerinthus line—we will briefly refer to the vague and chaotic tendencies grouped under the term "Cainite" and its variants. Our sources of information are limited, and except for brief mentions, they come mainly from Irenaeus and Epiphanius. Epiphanius mostly copies Irenaeus, adding only a few new details alongside his own thoughts.

This tradition is generally classified as "Ophite," and its followers called themselves Gnostics. They were notable for honoring Cain and Judas, which led to condemnation from the orthodox, who accused them of all kinds of evils. Epiphanius, writing two hundred years after Irenaeus, often adds embellishments to Irenaeus's account, even when he is just copying him. We will now explore why these Gnostics held such seemingly strange beliefs. Understanding the systems of Justinus and the Sethians will help in grasping what follows.

The main features of these Gnostics' beliefs are as follows: The creator of the world was not the supreme God; the absolute power from above was stronger than the lesser power of creation, symbolized as the impure world-womb that contains heaven and earth—the physical world. This physical world was considered an after-birth compared to the true birth from the pure spiritual womb, the ideal world of the aeons above. Epiphanius has confused this part of the system, which is related to the Valentinian concept of "deficiency" or "abortion"—the physical world—existing outside the ideal fullness or perfection, the world of the aeons.

The lesser power was considered the God of creation, while the greater power was the God of enlightenment and wisdom. The Old Testament's idea of God only went as far as obeying the commands of the lesser power. Those who followed these commands were seen as the heroes of old by the followers of the External Law. These followers, seeing no further, criticized anyone who refused to follow this law, the commands of the lesser power of creation. Thus, Abel, Jacob, Lot, and Moses were praised by the followers of the creation law. However, in reality, it was their opponents who should have been praised as followers of the Higher Law, who rejected the laws of the lesser power of creation and were therefore protected by Wisdom and taken to a higher realm.

They believed that Cain, Esau, the inhabitants of the Cities of the Plain, and Korah, Dathan, and Abiram represented those individuals or nations who followed a higher law and were unfairly criticized by the followers of Yahweh. This shows a clear contrast similar to those explored by Justinus, where the influence of psychic powers or angels is linked to Abel's line, and spiritual powers are connected to Cain's line. Abel offered blood sacrifices, while Cain offered fruits of the field.

This type of contrast was common, as seen in the later Ebionite contrasts of superior and inferior men (Isaac-Ishmael, Jacob-Esau, Moses-Aaron), or the Marcionite contrasts of the God of freedom and the God of the law, the God of Christ and the Yahweh of the Old Testament. However, the school of thought we are describing seemed to take their disdain for Yahweh to the most extreme conclusion. This is especially evident in their interpretations of New Testament history, which, despite their oddness, might still hold a small hint of the real reason for Jesus' death. This Gnostic group had several writings, with the most notable being two summaries of their teachings: one called The Gospel of Judas and the other The Ascent of Paul.

Taking The Ascent of Paul first, it claimed to document the indescribable things Paul reportedly saw when he ascended to the third heaven. It's unclear if this is the same as The Apocalypse of Paul mentioned by Augustine, but it is lost now. A more orthodox version of a document from the same period survives as The Vision of Paul, which can be found in the last volume of the Ante-Nicene Christian Library (1897). If we trust the title provided by Epiphanius, the Cainite school is consequently post-Pauline.

The strangest and most intriguing development of their theory was their view of Judas. The Ebionite tradition consistently condemned Judas, but there was apparently another tradition, likely Essene in origin, that saw things differently. Obscure references to this perspective seem to be preserved in the unclear accounts of the Cainite doctrines by Irenaeus and Epiphanius. This group viewed Judas as highly advanced in Gnostic discipline, recognizing the true God as distinct from the God of creation.

He taught complete separation from worldly things and from the lesser power that created heaven, earth, and flesh. Humanity was to reach the highest realm through the crucifixion of Christ. The Christ was a spirit that came from above to perfect the spiritual power in humans. Jesus triumphed over the weaker physical world by sacrificing his body to death, a manifestation of the God of creation. This was the Christological belief of the school, apparently based on The Gospel of Judas.

They had a historical tradition that Jesus, after becoming the Christ and teaching higher doctrines, fell away. They believed he tried to overthrow the law and corrupt holy teachings, which led Judas to turn him over to the authorities. In their view, Jesus's public preaching revealed the Mysteries too openly, leading to his condemnation for blasphemy by orthodox Jewish leaders.

Another mystical tradition in their texts claimed that the Christ did not make a mistake and that everything happened according to divine wisdom. The rulers of the world knew that if the Christ was betrayed and crucified (incarnated), their inferior power would drain away, and they would ascend to a spiritual realm. Judas understood this and, in his great faith, ensured Christ's betrayal, thus playing a key role in the world's salvation.

These Gnostics praised Judas as crucial to the salvation plan; without him, the "salvation of the cross" and the revelation of higher realms would not have occurred. The Cainite group, from their doctrines, appeared to be strict ascetics. But, according to Epiphanius, expanding on Irenaeus, these people were very dangerous and, like Carpocrates, taught that a person could not be saved without experiencing everything. Let's briefly look at the views of the Carpocratians.

#### The Carpocratians

Our main source of information is Irenaeus; Tertullian, Hippolytus, and Epiphanius simply copied him. Carpocrates, or Carpocras, was a Platonic philosopher who taught in Alexandria during the reign of Hadrian (A.D. 117-138). He led a Gnostic group called the Carpocratians, though they referred to themselves simply as Gnostics. The accusation Epiphanius made against them, 250 years later, is based on a misunderstanding of Irenaeus's mixed-up account, if not deliberate malice. The Bishop of Lyons clearly said that he didn't believe they actually did the things they were accused of, but that they would have if they followed their teachings consistently.

The confusion stems from the Church Father’s inability to understand the doctrine of rebirth. The main beliefs of the Carpocratians were as follows: The physical world was created by lesser powers, far inferior to the ineffable power of the unknown, uncreated Father. Jesus was the son of Joseph and Mary, born like other men. However, he differed because his soul, being strong and pure, remembered its experiences with the ineffable Father. This idea is similar to the Pythagorean, Platonic, and Hermetic traditions, which speak of the soul's orderly journey around the Spiritual Sun, in the Plain of Truth, in its natural state.

Due to his memory (which is the source of all wisdom and virtue), the Father gave him powers to escape the control of the world's rulers. Moving through all their realms and freeing himself from each, he finally ascended to the Father. Similarly, all souls with the same nature who make similar efforts will also ascend to the Father. Although Jesus grew up with typical Jewish beliefs, he rose above them and, with the powers he received from above, conquered human passions.

Believing that all souls who rise above worldly constraints will receive similar powers and perform similar wonders, these Gnostics claimed that some among them had reached the same level of perfection as Jesus, if not higher, and were stronger than Peter, Paul, and the other Apostles. They even taught that people could achieve higher levels of enlightenment than Jesus. However, it is unclear if they distinguished between Jesus and the Christ. These powers were considered "magical," and the next part of Irenaeus's writing reminds us of the beliefs of the "Simonian" school. These ideas were so widespread that Irenaeus complained that outsiders thought such views were the common beliefs of Christianity.

The next section discusses the idea that there is no essential evil in the universe; things are considered bad or good only by human opinion. Irenaeus concludes from their doctrine of rebirth that the soul must experience every kind of existence and activity in its cycle of rebirth. Irenaeus apparently got his information from a manuscript (MS) that claimed some souls could pay off their karmic debt in one lifetime. The MS quoted, "Agree with your adversary quickly while you are on the way with him, lest your adversary deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison. Truly, I say to you, you will not come out until you have paid the last penny." Here, the adversary represents the karmic record within a person; the judge is the ruler of the world; the officer is the one who creates the new body; and the prison is the body itself. The MS explains the text similarly to the Pistis Sophia treatise, which discusses reincarnation and karma.

However, Irenaeus has a different view. He believes the doctrine means that a soul must experience all good and bad things before being set free. He suggests that some souls can do this in one life. As a result, he accuses the Carpocratians of committing terrible crimes to experience everything and end the cycle of experiences. However, he also mentions that he doesn't believe the Carpocratians actually do such things, even though he feels their writings imply it. It's clear that the absurd conclusion comes from the ignorance of the Bishop of Lyons. He misunderstood the basic concepts of reincarnation and started with wrong assumptions, even though a beginner in Gnosticism would find the matter obvious.

The Carpocratians allegedly set up a branch in Rome around the year 150, under a woman named Marcellina. They had images of many esteemed teachers like Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, and also a portrait of Jesus. Interestingly, Celsus, as quoted by Origen, mentions the Harpocratians, who followed teachings from Salome, possibly suggesting that "Harpocratians" might be the correct term instead of "Carpocratians." Harpocrates was a Greek version of Horus, the Egyptian Mystery-God, and Salome was notable in the lost Gospel according to the Egyptians.

#### Epiphanes

Moving on, there are contradictory and clearly absurd legends around the second most famous name in the Carpocratian group, Epiphanes. Patristic writers made errors, like Epiphanius who wrongly attributed an entire Gnostic system found in Irenaeus to Epiphanes. This mix-up is somewhat understandable since the Greek word for "distinguished" is "eiphanes," and Epiphanius wrote 250 years after the real Epiphanes.

However, Clement of Alexandria, who usually is fair and lived in the same century as Epiphanes, made similar mistakes. His mistake is even more remarkable. Here is the story: Epiphanes was the son of Carpocrates and Alexandria, a woman from Cephallenia. He died at the young age of seventeen and was worshipped as a god with elaborate and sensual rites by the people of Cephallenia, in the great temple of Same, on the day of the new moon. This extraordinary story quickly drew the attention of modern scholars, and as early as Mosheim, the mystery was unraveled.

Volkmar explained in detail that the festival at Same honored the moon-god and included licentious rites. It was called the Epiphany (ta Epifania) in honor of Epiphanes (o Epifanes), meaning the "newly-appearing one," referring to the new moon, which lasts about seventeen days. Thus, Clement of Alexandria, misled by the similarity of the names and the story of licentious rites, passed down a scandalous myth.

It is doubtful whether Epiphanes ever existed. Clement also claimed that one of the most popular books among the Carpocratians was a treatise on justice, which he had seen. He attributed it to Epiphanes, but it is hard to believe that a seventeen-year-old boy could have written a complex dissertation on justice. Therefore, we conclude that the Carpocratians, or Harpocratians, were a Gnostic group in Alexandria at the beginning of the second century, and some of their ideas were presented in a book about justice, a copy of which Clement had seen.

This Gnostic community was very interested in the idea of communism practiced by early Christians. Being students of Plato, they wanted to turn this idea into a philosophical principle and follow it to its logical end. The false ideas of "mine" and "yours" were no longer to exist; private property was seen as the root of all human suffering and a departure from the early days of freedom. Therefore, everything was to be shared in common, including wives and husbands, reflecting Plato's ideas in The Republic.

However, there is no reliable evidence that the Gnostics actually practiced these ideas. It is also highly unlikely that educated and refined men, like the Gnostics typically were, who came to these views through Pythagorean and Platonic teachings, and through the teachings of Jesus, would have turned their meetings into orgies. This accusation was made by Clement, but it has been partially refuted by previous points.

It is possible, though, that there were communities in Alexandria and elsewhere, claiming to be Christian, that confused the early Love-feasts with orgies. Pagans accused Christians of such behavior indiscriminately, and Christian sects accused each other. It's believable that such abuses did occur among the ignorant and immoral. The Carpocratian school has sometimes been wrongly credited as the originator of the so-called Monadic Gnosis.

Neander has explored this idea in detail, but Salmon's summary will suffice for the general reader: "From one eternal Monad, all existence has flowed, and it strives to return to this source. However, finite spirits ruling different parts of the world counteract this universal striving for unity."

The various popular religions, especially Judaism, have emerged from these beliefs. Souls achieve perfection by recalling their past experiences and rising above limitations to contemplate a higher unity. They dismiss worldly restrictions, valuing only faith and love—where faith means a mystical focus on this unity. This helps them break free from material confinement and reach a state of perfect peace, similar to Buddhist Nirvana, once they transcend worldly appearances.

#### Cerinthus

As we trace back to the origins, we find the group known as the Cerinthians (or Merinthians, according to Epiphanius). They are named after Cerinthus, who lived in the latter half of the first century. Epiphanius has extensively discussed Cerinthus, making him a scapegoat for the "pillar-apostles'" conflict with Paul. Many writers have followed this narrative to explain certain contentious statements in the Acts and Paul's letters. However, impartial criticism rejects Epiphanius's late interpretations and returns to Irenaeus's brief account, which is the source for later writers.

Irenaeus, writing a century after Cerinthus, provides a short paragraph on him. Cerinthus represents a significant link between Ebionism (the original non-Pauline tradition) and the early second century. He is believed to have personally encountered John, the supposed author of the fourth Gospel. However, a similar claim is made about the mythical Ebion, so this story lacks any historical credibility.

Cerinthus is said to have been educated in the "Egyptian discipline" and to have taught in Asia Minor. This "Egyptian discipline" is thought to refer to the Philonic school, but this is only an assumption. Regardless, Cerinthus is significant because some Gnostics claimed he authored the Apocalypse, which is traditionally attributed to John. His name helps preserve one of the earliest forms of Christian tradition.

Cerinthus's teachings included a cosmology that highlighted the immense superiority of the supreme God over the lesser World-creator. His Christology stated that Jesus was the son of Joseph and Mary, and that the Christ, represented by the "Father in the form of a dove," descended upon him at his baptism. Only then did Jesus begin to prophesy, perform miracles, and preach about the previously unknown Father, the supreme God. According to Cerinthus, the Christ left Jesus before his suffering, death, and resurrection (or his appearance to followers after death). Irenaeus provides this account, which appears straightforward and credible.

The scriptures of the Cerinthians were not the version of the Sayings attributed to "Matthew," but an even earlier collection in Hebrew. All other collections and versions were considered entirely apocryphal. It is said that the writer of the fourth canonical Gospel composed his account to oppose the school of Cerinthus, but there is no evidence to support this claim.

#### Nicolaus

We have traced back to such early times that even the faintest glimmer of historical light fails us, leaving us in the dim realm of legend and speculation. We will not delve any deeper into the mysterious origins but instead return to the entrance of the cave, where some daylight is visible. Before doing so, we need to highlight the early Gnostic group, the Nicolaitans.

These Gnostics are particularly interesting to orthodox Christians because the writer of the Apocalypse mentions twice that he hates their actions. Encouraged by this, Irenaeus condemns the Nicolaitans along with some members of the church of Pergamus, who reportedly "ate food sacrificed to idols and committed immorality."

Later scholars, inspired by Irenaeus, added more accusations. Eventually, Epiphanius blamed Nicolaus for every wrongdoing he associated with the Gnostics, rhetorically asking, "What should I say to you, O Nicolaus?" We are surprised that someone as inventive as the Bishop of Salamis even needed to ask such a rhetorical question.

Tradition portrays Nicolaus as an ascetic and tells exaggerated stories about his detachment from passion. Even if he taught that eating sacrificial food was not a grave sin, there is no reason for us today to follow these Church Fathers in condemning everything that doesn't align with their specific interpretation of Christ's teachings.

#### Cerdo

Let's now return to the historical context of the second century and focus on the significant developments of Basilides and Valentinus.

Before proceeding, it’s important to provide a brief overview of the significant Marcionite movement, which once posed a serious challenge to the entirety of Christianity. This movement's approach was a precursor to modern critical methods. However, its conclusions were much more radical: it completely rejected the Old Testament and all the documents from the "in order that it might be fulfilled" school of Gospel compilation.

Marcion’s predecessor was reportedly a Syrian named Cerdo, who was active in Rome around 135 A.D. Marcion's fame eventually overshadowed Cerdo, leading to confusion among early Christian writers about their teachings and even their identities. Interestingly, despite Cerdo's unsettled relationship with the Church of Rome, there is no record of an official excommunication against him, suggesting that the idea of a strict orthodoxy had not yet fully developed within the Roman church.

Marcion's success likely accelerated the development of a canonical orthodoxy within the Roman church, which later became a model for subsequent Christian doctrine.

#### Marcion

Marcion was a wealthy shipowner from Sinope, a major port on the southern shore of the Black Sea. He was also a bishop and the son of a bishop. His main period of activity in Rome was between 150 and 160 A.D. Initially, he was in communion with the Roman church and made significant financial contributions. However, when the church elders failed to address his concerns and answer his important questions, he threatened to create a schism within the church and was eventually excommunicated. The origin of Marcionism is entirely unclear, and we have no reliable information about the lives of either Cerdo or Marcion. Church writers from the end of the second century, who are our best sources, cannot tell the story of the movement's beginnings with any certainty.

For all we know, Marcion may have developed his theories long before he came to Rome, possibly based on information and opinions he gathered during his long voyages. What we do know is that Marcion's views spread rapidly across the Graeco-Roman world. Even as late as the fifth century, we hear of Theodoret converting more than a thousand Marcionites. In Italy, Egypt, Palestine, Arabia, Syria, Asia Minor, and Persia, Marcionite churches emerged, well-organized, with their own bishops and ecclesiastical discipline, similar to what later became the Catholic Church. Orthodoxy had not yet declared for any party, and the Marcionite view had as good a chance as any other of becoming the universal one.

What was the secret of Marcion's success? As previously mentioned, it was the same as the success of modern criticism applied to the Old Testament. Marcion's view was, in some respects, even more moderate than the judgment of some modern thinkers; he was willing to admit that the Yahweh of the Old Testament was just. With great skill, he compared the sayings and actions attributed to Yahweh by the writers, compilers, and editors of the varied books of the Old Testament with the sayings and teachings of Christ.

This comparison highlighted that, although the best of the Old Testament could be seen as reflecting a Just God, they were different from the ideal of the Good God preached by Christ. We know that today, many of the best minds in the Church have rejected the harsh sayings and actions attributed to God in some Old Testament writings. This shows that Marcion's protest echoed what many enlightened Christians already felt.

At Marcion's time, the idea of a New Testament canon was either not yet conceived or just beginning to form. Marcion had his own idea of a canon, which was completely opposite to what later became the orthodox canon. Christ preached a universal doctrine, a new revelation of the Good God, the Father of all. Those who tried to merge this with Judaism, the incomplete creed of one small nation, were greatly mistaken and misunderstood Christ's teachings. Christ was not the Messiah promised to the Jews, who were expecting an earthly king meant only for them, and who had not yet come. Therefore, the "in order that it might be fulfilled" school had distorted and altered the original Sayings of the Lord with their incorrect interpretations.

This was the most severe critique of the cycle of New Testament "history" ever formulated. People were weary of the endless contradictions and obscurities in the many conflicting versions of the traditions about Jesus. No one could determine the truth after "history" had been altered to fit the new Messiah theory of the Jewish converts. When it came to actual history, Marcion began with Paul, believing he was the first to truly understand Christ's mission and had saved the teachings from the confusion of Jewish sectarianism. Among the various versions of the Gospel, Marcion accepted only the Pauline version. He rejected all other versions, including those attributed to Matthew, Mark, and John. He also dismissed the Gospel according to Luke, considering it a version adapted to favor the Judaizing faction. Marcion's Gospel was likely a collection of sayings used by the Pauline churches of his time.

Patristic writers accused Marcion of mutilating Luke's version, but it is hard to believe that Marcion, a sharp critic, would have kept certain verses that opposed his strong anti-Judaistic views if he had done so. The Marcionites argued that their Gospel was written by Paul directly from tradition and that Luke had nothing to do with it. However, this is doubtful because it is improbable that Paul wrote any Gospel.

Many orthodox apologists wrote against Marcion after his death, allowing us to reconstruct almost his entire Gospel. It starts with Christ's public preaching at Capernaum, is shorter than the current Luke document, and some skilled writers believe it was the original of Luke's version, though this is unlikely.

Marcion rejected all the documents in the New Testament collection except for ten of Paul's letters, parts of which he also dismissed as altered by those trying to reconcile differences between Peter and Paul. These ten letters were known as "The Apostle." The longest critique of Marcion's views is in Tertullian's "Against Marcion," written in 207 and the following years. While orthodox Christians have always praised this work, modern criticism and common sense reveal it to be just angry rhetoric.

Tertullian argues that Marcion taught about two Gods, the Just and the Good. However, Marcion actually believed that the Jewish idea of God in the Old Testament was inferior and opposed to the Good God revealed by Christ, a view he explained in the typical Gnostic manner. Given Tertullian's aggressive nature, as shown by his hostile address to Marcionites—"Now then, dogs, whom the apostle puts outside, and who bark at the God of truth, let's address your various questions! These are the bones you keep gnawing!"—we can't expect an unbiased treatment of the issue.

This summary provides a general understanding of Marcion's position, which was strong due to its simplicity and because it represented long-standing discontent in outer communities. However, it is challenging to derive a clear system of cosmogony or christology from the critiques of the well-known opponents of Marcionite doctrines.

It has even been questioned whether Marcion should be considered a Gnostic, but this issue was clarified by the work of Eznik, an Armenian bishop who lived around 450 A.D. In his book, "The Destruction of False Doctrines," he dedicates the last part to the Marcionites, who were still thriving at that time. Although there is some doubt whether the ideas described match Marcion's original system, it is clear that the Marcionite tradition had a strong Gnostic influence.

Marcion was more influenced by earlier Gnosticism than previously thought, particularly after Eznik's treatise was first translated into French in 1833. Here, we will briefly summarize Salmon's account of the Marcionite myth, noting its similarities to the system of Justinus.

There were three Heavens: in the highest was the Good God, in the middle was the God of the Law, and in the lowest were his Angels. Below these was Hyle, or root-matter. The world was created by both the God of the Law and Hyle. The Creative Power, seeing that the world was very good, wanted to create humans to inhabit it. So, Hyle provided the body, and the Creative Power gave the breath of life, the spirit. Adam and Eve lived innocently in Paradise and did not have children.

The God of the Law wanted to take Adam away from Hyle and make him serve him alone. So he said to Adam, "I am God and there is no other; if you worship any other God, you will die." Adam, fearing death, withdrew from Hyle. Hyle, who had been serving Adam, was upset by his withdrawal and, in revenge, filled the world with idolatry, leading people away from the Creator. The Creator became angry and, as people died, he cast them into Hell (Hades—the Unseen World), starting with Adam.

Eventually, God looked down from Heaven and saw the suffering of humanity caused by Hyle and the Creator. He felt compassion for them and sent His Son to save them. God said, "Go down, take on the form of a servant, and live like the sons of the Law. Heal their wounds, give sight to the blind, bring the dead to life, and perform miracles without seeking any reward. The God of the Law will become jealous and will incite his followers to crucify you. Then go to Hell, which will open to receive you, thinking you are among the dead. Free the captives there and bring them back to Me."

The souls were freed from Hell and taken up to the Father. The God of the Law became furious, tore his clothes, ripped the curtain of his palace, darkened the sun, and shrouded the world in darkness. Christ then descended a second time, now in His divine glory, to confront the God of the Law. The God of the Law was forced to admit he was wrong in thinking there was no higher power than himself.

Christ said, "I have a dispute with you, but I will use your own law as the judge. Isn't it written in your law that anyone who kills another must be killed, and whoever sheds innocent blood must have their own blood shed? Let me kill you and shed your blood, for I am innocent and you have shed My blood." Christ then listed the good deeds He had done for the children of the Creator and how He was crucified in return. The God of the Law had no defense and admitted, "I was ignorant; I thought you were just a man and didn't know you were divine. Take the revenge you deserve." Christ left him and went to Paul, revealing the path of truth.

The Marcionites were very strict ascetics who abstained from marriage, meat, and wine; the latter was even excluded from their Eucharist. They took great pride in the number of their martyrs. The Marcionites also gave us the oldest known Christian inscription with a date. It was found above the doorway of a house in a Syrian village, which used to be a Marcionite meeting house or church, interestingly called a synagogue. The date on the inscription is October 1, A.D. 318, and notably, the church was dedicated to "The Lord and Saviour Jesus, the Good"—Chrestos, not Christos.

There was much confusion between these two titles in early times. Christos is Greek for the Hebrew Messiah, meaning Anointed, and was used by those who believed Jesus was the Jewish Messiah. This was denied not only by the Marcionites but also by many of their Gnostic predecessors and successors. Chrestos referred to someone perfected, holy, or a saint. Later, orthodox editors, in ignorance, changed Chrestos to Christos wherever it appeared, limiting the promise of perfection to Jewish tradition alone and undermining the universality of religious history and doctrine. The Marcion school had various sub-schools and many notable teachers, though we will mention only Apelles here.

#### Apelles

Our most reliable information about this Gnostic comes from Rhodon, who opposed his views during the reign of Commodus (180-193 A.D.). An excerpt from Rhodon's lost "refutation" has been preserved by Eusebius.

At this time, Apelles was very old and avoided disputes, saying that all sincere believers would ultimately be saved, regardless of their specific beliefs—a very enlightened view, similar to the best ideas in Gnosticism. As Hort notes: "Rhodon unintentionally gives us a pleasant picture of Apelles in his old age. We see a man tirelessly seeking truth, humble and tolerant, holding onto beliefs he couldn't fully reconcile, but committed to maintaining the moral integrity of theology."

Unlike Marcion, Apelles seemed less exclusive in his views, although his book, "Reasonings," which criticized Mosaic theology, was quite severe. Eusebius also mentions that Apelles wrote many other books of a similar nature. However, Apelles was particularly criticized for his belief in the clairvoyant abilities of a woman named Philumene, whom he met in his old age. Her visions were documented in a book called "The Manifestations," which Apelles valued greatly.

Interestingly, Tertullian, who harshly criticized Apelles and accused him of immorality, also confessed his belief in the prophetic abilities of a woman in his own congregation in his treatise "On the Soul," revealing his own Montanist convictions in a very candid and naive way. In contrast, Rhodon, who knew Apelles personally in Alexandria, said that Apelles believed his age and well-known character would protect him from such slander.

Philumene appeared to have certain psychic abilities and was considered a "medium" for physical phenomena, as modern spiritists would say. She was one of the holy women or "virgins" who were quite common in the early Church, although it's doubtful that any of them received proper training, except in the most advanced Gnostic circles.

There is an interesting story about Philumene in a unique fragment by an unknown author, which was included in early editions of Augustine's work On Heresies, in the section about the Severians. Here is Hort's translation of the passage:

> Apelles claimed that a girl named Philumene was divinely inspired to predict future events. He would tell her about his dreams and mental disturbances, and she would secretly warn him through her predictions. [Some words seem to be missing here.] He said that the same spirit appeared to Philumene as a boy. This boy sometimes claimed to be Christ, and other times Paul. By questioning this spirit, she provided answers to her listeners. He also said that she performed some miracles, the most notable being her ability to put a large loaf of bread into a glass vase with a very small opening and then remove it unharmed with her fingertips. She only ate this bread, as if it was given to her from above.

All of this sounds very mystical and spiritual, typical of stories about supernatural phenomena. However, it is important to remember that this account comes from an unfriendly source, not from the Gnostics themselves. We may never know whether Apelles understood the origins of the phenomena he witnessed or, like many people of that time and even today, mistakenly believed that psychic powers proved the truth of theological doctrines.

Let's revisit the early years of the second century and focus on Basilides and his followers, who developed one of the most complex and consistent Gnostic systems. We can piece together its outlines from the fragmented accounts left by early Christian writers.

We know almost nothing about Basilides' life except that he taught in Alexandria. His exact dates are uncertain, but he is generally thought to have lived just before Valentinus, around A.D. 120-130, with a possible margin of ten years either way. Basilides' nationality is unknown, but whether he was Greek, Egyptian, or Syrian, he was deeply immersed in Hellenic culture and knowledgeable in Egyptian wisdom. He was also well-versed in the Hebrew scriptures as translated into Greek by the Seventy. He loved the teachings of the Gospel and wrote at least twenty-four books of commentaries on them, though he did not seem to use the versions that later became canonical. He also quoted several of Paul's letters.

The most significant of Basilides' writings were these commentaries, which were the first Gospel commentaries written by a Christian philosopher. In this and other areas of theology, the Gnostics were pioneers. Basilides is also said to have written a Gospel and claimed to be a disciple of Glaucias, who was an "interpreter of Peter." Additionally, the school highly regarded certain "Traditions of Matthias," which were supposedly secret teachings Jesus gave to Matthias after the resurrection. It can be assumed that the Gospel of Basilides wasn't a new historical account of the Sayings of the Lord but an explanation of the "knowledge of supermundane things," which Basilides defined as the Gospel.

Basilides likely wrote a commentary on the widely circulated Sayings and Doings of the Lord from various traditions, with or without their specific historical contexts. He also elaborated on certain inner teachings passed down through a secret tradition. Whether this inner Gospel was part of his twenty-four-book Exegetica is uncertain, though most critics believe it was. In any case, his commentaries probably aimed to explain the public Sayings and Parables using insights from this secret Gospel.

Another interesting hypothesis suggests that Matthias, a leader of the inner schools, wrote the original version of the Sayings and Doings that our Synoptic accounts are based on. These accounts were then expanded by various elders of the outer churches in Egypt. The original draft was likely a Life meant for public circulation, interpretable according to the inner teachings of Gnosis. Basilides is also said to have written some Odes, though no fragments of these have survived.

#### The Basilidian Gnosis

Our main sources of information for reconstructing Basilidian Gnosis are three fragmentary quotations: (1) from Hippolytus in his later work, The Philosophumena; (2) from Clement of Alexandria in his Miscellanies; and (3)In the beginning, either from the lost work of Justin or the lost work of Agrippa Castor (who Eusebius says wrote a critique of Basilides' views during Hadrian's reign around 133 A.D.), Irenaeus copied some very unsatisfactory and inaccurate data. These were also summarized by those who condensed the earlier, now lost, work of Hippolytus.

When we turn to Hippolytus' major work, we find the most valuable information available for reconstructing Basilides' highly metaphysical system. Hippolytus clearly had a treatise by Basilides, though it's unclear if it was the Exegetica. What is certain is that it explained the Gospel, or the "knowledge of supermundane things," as Basilides understood it.

Unfortunately, we don't have Basilides' original text, only a flawed copy of the Church Father's Refutation. Hippolytus mixes his own comments and criticisms with incomplete quotes, poorly summarizes key passages that require precise language, and generally does not do justice to Basilides, who believed Christianity was not just a narrow dogmatic theology but a universal philosophy explaining the entire world.

So, let's elevate our thoughts to the sublime heights that Basilides reached centuries ago when faith in the universal potential of the Gospel was truly alive. First, we must grasp the profound intuition of Deity that transcends even existence. To narrow minds, this may seem like nothingness, but it is actually the source of all fullness. Beyond time, space, consciousness, and existence itself—

> There was a time when nothing existed; not even the concept of 'nothing' as we understand it. In the purest sense, there was absolutely nothing, not even the One (the principle of reality). When I say 'was,' I don't mean to imply any state of being; I'm only using the term to convey the idea of absolute nothingness. This 'nothing' is beyond what we call the Ineffable; it surpasses even that. The truly ineffable can't be named Ineffable, as it is beyond all names.
>
> Our names can't even fully describe the universe we know, it's so diverse. Therefore, it's even more challenging to name the entities of the real world and their actions. It's utterly impossible to name what goes beyond reality. Basilides, a philosopher, went beyond Plato’s ideal world and reached the unnameable intuition of the Orient—the ultimate reality that can only be revered in silence.

We then come to the beginning of the Seed of Universality, a state beyond existence, a distinct stage even beyond the unmanifested or noumenal world. Hippolytus summarizes this state of non-being, which surpasses all existence, as follows:

> There was nothing—no matter, no substance, no void, no simplicity, no complexity, no concept, no perception, neither human, angel, nor god; in short, nothing that has ever been named or any action that can be conceived or perceived by humans. The state of non-being, which is even more beyond human understanding, existed when (if we can even use the word 'when' for a state beyond time and space) the Deity beyond existence, without thinking, feeling, deciding, choosing, being forced, or desiring, chose to create everything.
>
> When I use the term 'will, I do so just to convey the idea of an action that surpasses all human volition, thought, or perception. And this creation was not our universe, which later came into existence and was separated from others, but the Seed of all universes.

This idea is similar to the Mulaprakriti in Indian philosophy and is an excellent expression of the "creation out of nothing" concept by any Christian philosopher. "This universal Seed contained everything within itself, potentially, much like a mustard seed contains the entire plant—roots, stem, branches, leaves, and countless seeds that produce more plants in a continuous series.

"Thus, the Divinity beyond being created universality beyond being from elements beyond being, establishing a single entity"—which we call a Seed due to the limitations of language, but it was truly the potential of all potentials, as it "contained within itself the complete potential for the universe." From such a Seed, which is both everywhere and nowhere, and which holds everything that was, is, or will be, all things must come into manifestation in their "proper natures and cycles" and times, according to the will of the Deity beyond all.

How this happens is not entirely clear. Basilides had an idea of a "supplementary development" that is beyond definition. However, it is clear that he rejected any notion of emanation, projection, or creation from existing materials. He argued that God did not need any sort of emanation or matter to create the universe, like a spider weaving a web or a man using brass or wood to make something.

Instead, God simply spoke, and it came into being, as illustrated by Moses' words, "Let there be light," and there was light. The light came from nothing, brought into existence by God's command. The spoken word, "Let there be light," came from a state beyond existence. This idea is echoed in the Gospel, which mentions the true light that enlightens everyone. Humans derive their essence from this Seed and are also enlightened by it. This primordial Light and Life is the source of everything.

The next stage involves the highest outcome of universal potential, which Basilides calls the Sonship.

In the absolute Seed, there was a triple Sonship, entirely of the same substance as the God beyond existence, coming into being from the state beyond existence. This triple Sonship had three aspects: one extremely subtle, one less subtle, and one that still needed purification. The most subtle nature of the Sonship immediately rose up, driven by the Seed of universality given by the God beyond existence. It ascended quickly, like a thought or a wing, as Homer describes, and was with the God beyond existence. Every nature strives for Him because of His supreme beauty and loveliness, though in different ways.

In contrast, the less subtle nature of the Sonship stayed within the universal Seed. It wanted to ascend like the higher nature but couldn't, as it lacked the subtlety of the first Sonship that had already ascended. Thus, the less subtle Sonship remained behind. To ascend, it needed something like wings, which are provided by the Holy Spirit. Just as a bird needs wings to fly and wings need a bird to soar, the second Sonship and the Holy Spirit are interdependent and benefit each other.

Basilides is discussing the second aspect of the Logos, a state that is both positive and negative. This foreshadows the major theological debates that emerged later, such as Arianism and the Filioque controversy. According to Basilides, the Holy Spirit comes from the universal Seed, the source of all things under the will of Deity.

The second Sonship, lifted by the Spirit like a wing, also supports the Spirit. Together, they approach the first Sonship and the God beyond existence, who creates from a state beyond being. The Spirit could no longer stay with the Sonship because they were different in nature.

Just as a dry atmosphere is harmful to fish, the state of the Sonship and the divine was unnatural for the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the Sonship left the Spirit near a holy place that can't be fully described or understood. The Spirit wasn't completely abandoned or separated from the Sonship, similar to how a vessel still retains the scent of a perfume even after being emptied. The Holy Spirit, though separated from the Sonship, still carried its essence.

This is like the biblical reference to the anointing oil on Aaron's head, symbolizing the Holy Spirit's influence reaching everywhere, even to the material world. This influence helped the remaining Sonship to ascend, as everything moves from a lower to a higher state. The third Sonship, however, still remains in the mixture of seeds, interacting and benefiting each other, which will be explained later.

Basilides describes the Holy Spirit as the Limitary Spirit, which separates the physical universe from the spiritual realm, while still permeating everything. This firmament is far beyond the visible one, which is located along the moon's path. "After this, from the universal seed and mixture, the Great Ruler emerged and came into existence. He is the head of the sensible universe, possessing a beauty, magnitude, and power that can destroy." This is the demiurge, but no human should think they can fully understand such a great being, "for he is beyond description, more powerful than any power, wiser than the wisest, and superior to any excellence one can name."

Upon coming into existence, he lifted himself up and soared as high as the Great Firmament. There he stayed, believing there was nothing above him, and thus he became the most powerful being in the universe, except for the third Sonship that still remained in the seed-mixture. His limit was his ignorance of the supercosmic spaces, even though his wisdom was the greatest in the cosmic realms.

"Thinking himself the lord, ruler, and a wise creator, he set out to create the beings of the universe." This refers to the supercelestial or aetherial creation, which corresponds physically to the spaces beyond the moon. Below the moon was our world and its "atmosphere." This atmosphere ended at the visible heaven, or lower firmament, marked by the moon's path. In the sun-space were the aetherial realms, which no mortal eye has seen, only the reflection of their inhabitants, the stars, on the surface of the sublunary waters of space.

The Great Ruler's creation in the aetherial realm follows the principles of similarity and analogy. "First, the Great Ruler, thinking it was not right to be alone, made and brought into existence from the universal Seed a Son far better and wiser than himself." All of this had been predetermined by the supreme God when He planted the universal Seed. "The Great Ruler, upon seeing his Son, was filled with wonder, love, and amazement at his incredible beauty, and he made him sit at his right hand."

The area where the throne of the Great Ruler is located is called the Ogdoad. "The wise Great Demiurgos created the entire etherial realm with his own hands, but his Son, who was even wiser, gave him energy and ideas." In other words, the Great Ruler created the beings of the etherial spaces, and these beings gained souls. Thus, the son is considered greater than the father and sits at his right hand, a position that symbolizes a higher status in Gnostic symbolism. They both provide benefits: one gives the body and the other gives the mind or soul to etherial beings.

All etherial spaces, down to the moon, are managed by the Son of the Great Ruler, the pinnacle of his creation. "Then, a second Ruler emerged from the universal Seed, far inferior to the first but greater than all those below him, except for the Sonship that remained in the Seed." This second Ruler governs the sublunary spaces, from the moon to the earth.

This Ruler is called effable because humans can understand and speak of him, and his realm is named the Hebdomad. The second Ruler also "brought forth a Son far greater than himself from the universal Seed, similar to the first," and the lower creation was organized in the same way as the higher one. This lower creation is still made of subtle matter.

Regarding the earth, the mixture of seeds is still in our current space and time. The events that happen here follow the natural order, as they were initially determined by the one who planned the appropriate time, form, and manner for these events. On earth, there's no specific ruler or creator because the plan set by the God beyond existence is sufficient. The earth is a moment between the past and future, the turning point of all choices, and the field of new karma. Here, everything is ultimately in God's hands. This perspective allows Basilides to address the complexities of fate and free will.

Next, we look at Basilides' views on redemption and the restoration of all things. When the supercosmic planes and the whole universe (including the aetherial, sublunary, and terrestrial realms) were completed without any deficiency, meaning when the evolution of creative energy began to reverse, there was still a part of the universal Seed—the third Sonship—which both gives and receives benefits.

This Sonship also needed to be revealed and restored to its place beyond the highest Firmament, alongside the most subtle Sonship and the second Sonship, following the God beyond existence. This is in line with the scripture that says, "And the creation itself groans and labors, waiting for the manifestation of the Sons of God"—which refers to the third Sonship. The Sons of God are the divine sparks, the true spiritual beings within us, who have remained here in the seed-mixture to guide, inform, correct, and perfect our souls, which naturally tend to stay in this current state of existence.

Before the Gospel was preached and the Gnosis arrived, the Great Ruler of the Ogdoad was considered by even the most spiritual people to be the only God. However, he was not given a name because he was considered ineffable. Moses’s inspiration, on the other hand, came from the Hebdomad, as evident from the words, "I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but I did not reveal my name to them." This God, to whom Moses and the Prophets assigned names, was from the Hebdomad, which is expressible, and their inspiration came from this source.

The Gospel, however, was a mystery unknown not only to the nations but also to those of the Hebdomad and the Ogdoad, and even to their rulers. A Gnostic teacher explains:

> When the time came for the revelation of the children of God (which is us), for whom the whole creation yearns in expectation, the Gospel (the Glad Tidings, the Gnosis) entered the universe. It passed through every principality, authority, and lordship, and every title that humans use. It truly 'came,' not that anything 'descended' from above or that the blessed Sonship 'left' that Blessed God beyond all being who transcends all thought. No, just as naphtha vapor can ignite from a distant flame, so do the powers of the human spirit rise from below from formlessness to Sonship.
>
> The Son of the Great Ruler of the Ogdoad, catching fire as it were, grasps and seizes the ideas from the blessed Sonship beyond the Limitary Spirit. The power of the Sonship within the Holy Spirit, in the Limit Space, shares the flowing and rushing thoughts of the supreme Sonship with the Son of the Great Ruler. The Gospel first came from the Son, who sits beside the Great Ruler, to that Ruler.
>
> The Ruler realized that he wasn't the supreme God, but a lesser deity, and that above him was the source of all being and the true divinity. He repented and was afraid upon understanding his ignorance. This is what is meant by, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom." He began to grow wise through Christ's teachings, learning about the true nature of being, the Son, the Holy Spirit, the structure of the universe, and how it would be restored. This wisdom is the "mystery" mentioned in Scripture, "Not in words taught by human wisdom, but by the Spirit."
>
> The Great Ruler, now instructed and humbled, confessed his sin of arrogance. This is reflected in the words, "I have recognized my sin, and I know my transgression, and I will confess it forever." After the Great Ruler was taught, the entire Ogdoad (a heavenly realm) was also instructed, and the Mystery was revealed to the powers above the heavens.
>
> Then the Gospel was sent to the Hebdomad (another heavenly realm) so that its Ruler could be taught and enlightened in the same way. The Son of the Great Ruler illuminated the Son of the Ruler of the Hebdomad with the Light he had received from above. The Son of the Hebdomad's Ruler then preached the Gospel to his own Ruler, who, like the Great Ruler, feared and confessed his sin.
>
> Thus, all things in the lower realms were enlightened and received the Gospel. The time had come to bring clarity to the formlessness of our world and to reveal the Mystery to the Sonship, which had remained in formlessness, much like someone born prematurely. This is the "mystery which was not known to former generations," as it is written, "By revelation, the mystery was made known to me," and "I heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for man to utter."
>
> From the Hebdomad, the Light—which had already descended from the Ogdoad to the Son of the Hebdomad—came down upon Jesus, son of Mary, illuminating him and aligning him with the Light that entered him. This explains the saying, "The Holy Spirit shall come upon You"—meaning that what came from the Sonship through the Limitary Spirit to the Ogdoad and Hebdomad extended down to Mary (the body)—and "The Power of the Highest shall overshadow You"—referring to the divine creative power from the heights above, through the Demiurgos, belonging to the Son.

Hippolytus's text is complex, and he seems to misunderstand Basilides's thought. The "Son" likely represents the soul. The power belongs to the soul, not to Mary (the body); the divine creative power transforms man into a god, whereas the body can only reproduce physically. Additionally, Jesus appears to symbolize every member of the Sonship, every Son of God.

The world will remain intact until the entire Sonship—which has stayed behind to benefit the souls in formlessness and to receive benefits by creating forms for them (since the spirit needs a psychic vehicle for conscious contact with this plane)—follows Jesus's example, rises upward, and becomes purified. Through purification, it becomes very refined, enabling it to rise freely by its own power, similar to the first Sonship. It naturally shares its power with the Light that came from above.

When the entire Sonship ascends beyond the Great Limit, the Spirit will turn the whole creation into the focus of Great Mercy. The creation has been groaning and suffering, waiting for the Sons of God to be revealed. This means that all the men of the Sonship will ascend beyond creation. When this happens, God will bring the Great Ignorance (Maha-pralaya) upon the universe, so everything will remain in its natural state, and nothing will desire anything against its nature.

In this state of existence, the souls that are meant to remain immortal in this realm will stay without knowing anything different or better. There will be no talk or knowledge of higher states, so these lower souls won't suffer by longing for unattainable things, like fish trying to live on mountains with sheep. Such desires would lead to their destruction. Everything is indestructible if it stays in its proper condition but can be destroyed if it tries to go beyond its natural limits.

Similarly, the Ruler of the Hebdomad will not know of the things above him, as the Great Ignorance will affect him too. This way, he will have no sorrow, pain, or lamentation. He will not desire the impossible, and thus, he will not suffer grief. In a similar way, the Great Ignorance will take hold of the Great Ruler of the Ogdoad and all the ethereal creations under him. This prevents anything from desiring what is unnatural and thus experiencing pain. This marks the restoration of all things, which were originally set according to nature in the Seed of the universe at the beginning and will be restored to their original state in their appointed cycles.

The Saviour's words, "My hour has not yet come," and the Magi observing His star, both testify that everything has its proper cycle and time. He too was predestined in the Seed to be subject to the stars' nativity and the return of time periods to their starting points.

According to the Basilidian Gnosis, the Saviour was the perfected spiritual "man" within the psychic and animal man or soul. When a person reaches this stage of perfection, the Sonship within them leaves the soul behind here. The soul is no longer mortal but remains in its natural state, having become immortal, similar to how the first Sonship left behind the Holy Spirit in its proper place. It is only upon reaching perfection that the true "man" is "clothed with a truly immortal soul."

Every part of creation advances a stage, and the whole plan of salvation is accomplished by separating the various principles into their proper states. Jesus was the first example of this process. His physical part, which belongs to formless matter, suffered but was restored to its formless state. His psychic vesture, which belongs to the Hebdomad, rose and was restored to the Hebdomad.

He elevated the part of him that was like the Great Ruler to a high position, where it stayed with the Great Ruler. Additionally, he raised even higher the part that was like the Great Limit, and it stayed with the Limitary Spirit. Through him, the third Sonship, which was originally in a mixed or impure state to help and be helped, was purified. It ascended through all these purified levels to join the blessed Sonship above.

The main idea behind this system is the separation, classification, or restoration of various elements or principles that were mixed in the original world-seed or universal substance. This purification process brought people Gnosis, or the perfection of consciousness. Man was the pinnacle of the world-process, and the perfected man, Christ the Savior, was the pinnacle of humanity and thus the manifestation of Deity, the Sonship.

Hippolytus likely provides us with the true outline of Basilidian beliefs. The Philosophumena were only published in 1851 after the manuscript was discovered in a library on Mount Athos in 1842. Before this, only the brief and distorted accounts of Irenaeus and other summarizers were known about this great Gnostic's profound ideas.

The publication of Philosophumena has changed all previous views and corrected earlier misrepresentations, now referred to as the "spurious Basilidian system." We will discuss this further later. In the meantime, let's turn to Clement of Alexandria, who focuses solely on the ethical aspects of Basilidian Gnosticism and avoids the "metaphysical" part.

Here, "metaphysical" refers to things beyond the physical world, as Aristotle described. Regarding marriage, Basilides and his son Isidorus believed it was natural but not necessary. They took a middle ground between the strict asceticism of some schools and the Jewish belief that a man without a wife is incomplete.

Regarding the undeserved sufferings of martyrs, Basilides, drawing on the concepts of reincarnation and karma, writes in Book 23 of his Exegetica:

> I believe that those who face these so-called tribulations are people who, after committing other undiscovered wrongs, are led to this noble end (martyrdom) by Providence. This way, their unproven crimes are different from what they actually did, so they don't suffer as convicted criminals like adulterers or murderers. Instead, they suffer only for being Christians, which comforts them so much that they don't even seem to suffer. Even if someone suffers without first committing any visible wrongdoing—an extremely rare occurrence—they do not suffer because of any evil plot. They suffer in the same way an innocent baby might suffer.
>
> Just as a baby, who hasn't done anything wrong or committed any sin, still has the potential for sin due to past lives, and benefits from suffering in ways that are otherwise hard to achieve, the same applies to a completely virtuous person who has never sinned. This person still has the tendency to sin but hasn't committed any actual sin because they haven't been in the right circumstances.
>
> Even for such a person, we can't assume total freedom from sin. Just as the intention to commit adultery makes someone an adulterer, even if they don't get the chance to do it, and the intention to commit murder makes someone a murderer, even if they can't carry it out, the same logic applies here. If I see such a "sinless" person suffering, even if they haven't done anything wrong, I would say they have the will to transgress. I will say anything rather than claim that Providence is evil.
>
> Moreover, even if critics bring up the example of Jesus, who preferred miracles over laws, the defender of Gnosis would respond: "If you allow, I will say Jesus did not sin but suffered like a baby." And if pressed further, he would say: "The person you mention is human, but only God is truly righteous, for 'no one is pure from pollution,'" as Job said.

Men suffer, according to Basilides, due to their actions in previous lives. The "elect" soul suffers honorably through martyrdom, while other souls receive different suitable punishments. The "elect" soul is one that endures suffering for an ideal, meaning it has faith, which is the soul's agreement to things beyond physical sensation. Such a soul "discovers doctrines without needing logical proof by an intellectual understanding."

The common misconception of transmigration – the idea that a human soul can enter an animal's body – is often confused with reincarnation, which denies this possibility. The Basilidian school provided a rational explanation for this belief. They considered the animal nature within humans, the animal soul, or the body of desire, where passions reside. Clement summarized their doctrine:

> The Basilidians call passions 'appendages' or 'accretions.' They believe these entities have a real existence and attach themselves to the rational soul due to a certain turmoil and primordial confusion.

The term "entities" here literally means "spirits." Interestingly, in the Pistis Sophia text, the whole animal soul is called the "counterfeit spirit," and in Plato's Timaeus, a similar idea is referred to as "turmoil," as noted by Proclus. The primordial confusion refers to the chaotic mix of universal seeds and the differentiation of "elemental essence" discussed by modern theosophists.

> Onto this core, other mixed and foreign natures of the essence grow, like those of the wolf, ape, lion, goat, etc. When the unique qualities of certain natures surround the soul, they cause the soul's desires to resemble the special traits of these animals, as the soul imitates the actions of those it reflects. Human souls not only connect deeply with the impulses and impressions of irrational animals, but they also mimic the movements and beauties of plants because they too carry plant-like characteristics. Additionally, some traits of minerals, such as the hardness of diamond, are also evident in habits.

However, we should not believe that a person is made up of several souls or that it is right for a person to succumb to their animal nature and blame their wrongdoings on external influences. The choice and responsibility lie with the rational soul. Isidorus, son of Basilides, writes in his book "On an Appended Soul":

> If I were to convince someone that the true soul is not singular, but that the passions of the wicked are driven by external natures, it would unfairly excuse the immoral for saying, 'I was forced, I was carried away, I acted unwillingly.' In reality, it is the individual who directed their desire towards evil and chose not to resist the constraints of these external influences. Our task is to demonstrate our control over the lesser aspects within us, mastering them through our rational mind.

In essence, a person remains the same regardless of their body or appearance; these external aspects do not define the person. One of the school's most significant celebrations was the Baptism of Jesus, held on the fifteenth day of the Egyptian month Tobe or Tybi.

Clement reports that the followers of Basilides celebrate Jesus' baptism with a night service of readings. They interpret "the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar" to mean the fifteenth day of the month Tybi. At that time, they believe the Father, symbolized by a dove (representing the Holy Spirit), descended upon Jesus. This interpretation suggests that the Basilidians did not take the canonical gospels literally, as Hippolytus claims. Instead, they viewed these events as symbolic legends of initiation, detailed in the Pistis Sophia treatise.

Agrippa Castor, according to Eusebius, tells us that Basilides required his disciples to remain silent for five years, similar to the Pythagorean tradition. Basilides and his followers valued the writings of Barcabbas and Barcoph, as well as other Oriental texts. Scholars believe that Barcabbas and Barcoph refer to lost Zoroastrian literature, which was popular among many Gnostic communities.

After the return from Babylonia, learned Jews, Essenes, and the theosophically inclined incorporated traditions from the Magi and the great Iranian faith into their eclectic and syncretistic religion. The Avesta literature we have today is thought to be a small recovered portion of the vast library of Persepolis, which Parsi tradition says was destroyed by Alexander the Great. It seems very likely, as Cumont has shown in his recently published major work on the subject, that the Mithraic mystery tradition contains an authentic lineage similar to the Parsi tradition. This offers valuable insights into Zoroastrianism, which was connected to Gnosticism.

The real Basilidian system can be deduced from the writings of Hippolytus and Clemens Alexandrinus, who only selected points they thought they could refute, focusing on what they considered the most erroneous aspects. To a student of comparative religion, it's clear that both Church Fathers misunderstood the tenets they quoted. Even these selectively criticized passages fit into the broader scheme of universal theosophy when removed from the context of Patristic refutation and evaluated on their own merits. It's deeply regrettable that the writings of the Basilidian school have been lost or destroyed, as they would have shed much light on both Christian theosophy and the obscure history of its origins.

We will now briefly refer to the "spurious" Basilidian system. The following points, taken from Irenaeus and other summarizers, further demonstrate the unreliability of Irenaeus, a key figure in orthodox heresiology. These writers and copyists had no firsthand knowledge of Basilides' teachings and merely repeated the fanciful ideas attributed to the school by popular rumor. According to their account, the Basilidians' god was named Abraxas or Abrasax, who ruled their first heaven, and there were no fewer than 365 heavens. This power was named because the total of the numerical values of the Greek letters in the name Abrasax is 365, the number of days in a year.

According to Hippolytus, this part of the system relates to a much lower level of creation than the supreme God. It is unclear whether the Abrasax concept should be linked to the Great Ruler of the Ogdoad, or the Ruler of the Hebdomad and the region up to the aether. Regardless, the 365 "heavens" are connected to the astrological and genetic beliefs of Egyptian and Chaldaean occult science, representing the 365 "aspects" of the heavenly bodies throughout the year as seen from the earth's atmosphere up to the moon.

Interestingly, in the Pistis Sophia treatise, the mysteries of embryology are directed by a hierarchy of 365 elemental powers or builders, who follow karmic law to shape a new body based on past deeds. This is detailed alongside an astrological scheme where one ruler governs four others, with each of the four ruling over ninety powers, totaling 365.

In 1853, Schwartze’s translation of this treatise from Coptic clarified the Abrasax concept, just two years after Miller's 1851 edition of The Philosophumena, which debunked the widespread belief that "Abrasax" was the Basilidian name for the supreme God. Additionally, an ancient anonymous treatise in the Codex Brucianus frequently uses the number 365 in its hierarchies but does not mention Abrasax. The elemental forces that shape the body are the lowest servants of karmic law. The lowest powers likely made up the Abrasax of the common people.

The supreme God rules over an endless hierarchy of rulers, gods, archangels, authorities, and powers, all of which surpass the 365. The mysteries of the unseen world were so detailed that even those who dedicated their lives to studying them could barely understand some of the simpler processes, although the general concept was straightforward. Basilides required his disciples to observe five years of silence and said that "only one out of 1,000, and two out of 10,000" could truly grasp the Gnosis, the culmination of many lifetimes of effort. Interestingly, this phrase also appears in the Pistis Sophia treatise.

The term Abrasax is well-known to students of Gnosticism because it's found on many gems attributed to Basilides' followers. Despite extensive studies by great Continental scholars and contributions by King, the latest authorities believe that "there is no tangible evidence for attributing any known gems to Basilidianism or any other form of Gnosticism."

Gnosticism tended to surpass every form of belief or superstition. The ignorant populace likely believed in Abrasax as the great power governing birth and daily life, according to astrological ideas. Talismans, invocations, and other magical items often bore this powerful "name of power." However, behind the superstition, there were certain occult facts that the common astrologers and talisman-makers were unaware of.

The following facts seem to have been known to the Gnostic teachers, who appropriately incorporated them into their universal systems. Abrasax, the Great God of the uninformed, was placed among the lower levels of Gnostic hierarchies, and the common perception of him was attributed to the lowest building powers of the physical body. As for the rest of the "spurious system," there is nothing noteworthy to mention. However, we cannot leave out the most absurd tale told about the Basilidians: it was said that they believed Jesus swapped bodies with Simon of Cyrene at the crucifixion and then mocked those he had deceived while his substitute suffered. This ridiculous story comes from the Irenaeic "store-house of Gnosticism."

Regarding the history of the Basilidian school, we know little beyond the fact that Epiphanius, at the end of the fourth century, still encountered Basilidian Gnostics in the areas west of the Delta, from Memphis to the sea. It is more likely, however, that this school remained part of mainstream Gnosticism during the latter half of the second century and influenced the significant Valentinian movement, which we will discuss next.

Indeed, it is very probable that the followers of mainstream Gnosticism would have strongly objected to being classified as followers of Basilides or Valentinus. They likely viewed these teachers as transmitters of a living tradition in their own unique ways, rather than as individual revealers of new doctrines.

#### The Valentinian Movement

Behind the entire Valentinian movement stands the influential and enigmatic figure of Valentinus himself, universally recognized as the greatest of the Gnostics. Even his harshest critics acknowledge his exceptional learning and eloquence, and no one has ever questioned his moral character. However, when we examine the chaotic "information" left by Patristic writers about Valentinianism, the enigmatic figure of the great Gnostic master remains elusive. Despite his name being associated with the restructuring of the whole system, he remains the "great unknown" of Gnosticism. We know nothing certain about him as a person or a writer, except for a few fragmented pieces given to us by polemical critics.

I am not addressing the debated issue of the authorship or compilation of the treatises in the Askew and Bruce Codices. Personally, I believe Valentinus contributed significantly to these works, though this cannot be conclusively proven with our limited information. Conversely, it also cannot be disproven. It is strange that, despite the universally acknowledged greatness of Valentinus, none of his works have survived. His writings were said to be extremely complex and challenging, synthesizing and harmonizing earlier Gnostic formulations.

This is not the case with the well-known outline of the system attributed to "those of Valentinus" by the Church Fathers. However, the Coptic translations of the treatises reflect such complexity that they could only have been crafted by the most brilliant Gnostics, and Valentinus is reputed to have been the most brilliant of them all.

Despite the widespread ignorance about Valentinus and his teachings, the so-called Valentinian Gnosis is a major focus in nearly all heresiological writings. Therefore, we must ask for the reader's patience while we outline some key points of Valentinianism, as viewed by its critics. It is important to remember that "Valentinianism" was not a unique form of Gnosis; rather, it was the main branch of Gnosticism, named after its most prominent leader.

Apart from a few fragments we've mentioned, most writings by the Church Fathers refer to the teachings of Valentinus' followers. Even then, it is rare to find an unaltered quote from any of their works; most of what we have are pieces taken out of context or based on hearsay. The followers of Valentinus were not mere imitators who repeated his words without thought. They were independent thinkers who each developed the universal philosophy in their own way.

While the presentation of Gnosis had become more consistent in its main ideas by this time—possibly due to Valentinus' influence—it remained highly flexible and varied in many details. His followers were driven by a spirit of research, discovery, and adaptation, characteristic of a vibrant spiritual and intellectual era.

This explains Irenaeus' complaint that he could never find two Valentinians who agreed with each other. Given this diversity, what is the point of talking about a single "Valentinian system"? We know very little about the teachings of Valentinus himself from the Church Fathers. His followers each added their own modifications, making it difficult to understand their teachings clearly. The Church Fathers' accounts are so confusing that they make the followers seem to contradict each other and themselves.

In 1851, "The Philosophumena" mentioned an Eastern and Western division of the school of Valentinus, explaining the title of the "Extracts from Theodotus" found in "The Miscellanies of Clement of Alexandria." Critics have overemphasized the minor doctrinal differences between the Eastern (Anatolic) and Western (Italic) schools described by Hippolytus. Lipsius showed that the "Extracts from Theodotus," which claim to belong to the Eastern school, actually contain elements of both Eastern and Western teachings. This confusion means that we cannot rely on the division into Anatolic and Italic schools to understand Valentinianism, unless we assume these were originally just geographical labels that later acquired unsuccessful doctrinal meanings.

Although we do not know exactly when Valentinus lived, it is guessed to be between A.D. 100 and A.D. 180. The earliest known leaders of the movement after him are Secundus and Marcus. By 150, Marcus had already gained a large following. His followers were known as Marcosians or Marcians, not Valentinians. Marcus's teachings were very different from those of other followers of Valentinus. Some believe Marcus was a contemporary of Irenaeus, but this is based on the assumption that Irenaeus was addressing a living person when he used "you" in his writings, rather than using it for rhetorical effect, as Tertullian did with Marcion.

Later, we encounter Ptolemaeus, who is also thought to have been a contemporary of Irenaeus around 180 AD. Irenaeus did not know Ptolemaeus personally and mainly dealt with his followers, who were said to have deviated significantly from Ptolemaeus's original teachings.

After Ptolemaeus, Heracleon appears. Clement (around 193 AD) regarded Heracleon as the most distinguished of Valentinus's disciples. Both Heracleon and Ptolemaeus are known more for their interpretations of scripture from a Gnostic perspective rather than for creating a system of beliefs.

By around 220 AD, Axionicus and Bardesanes were prominent. Axionicus taught in Antioch, and Bardesanes even farther east. They are sometimes referred to as leaders of the Anatolic or Oriental school. Theodotus, whose writings are included in Clement's Miscellanies, lived earlier, but little is known about him. Additionally, there are mentions of Theotimus and Alexander, who lived before 220 AD.

In summary, the influence of Valentinus spread widely, from Egypt to Syria, Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, and westward to Rome, Gaul, and even Spain. Reviewing the teachings attributed to these Gnostic leaders will conclude our study of Gnosticism's indirect sources for the first two centuries.

The main point we need to emphasize is that we are dealing with a significant movement, not just a single system. On one side, older forms of Gnosticism that were very hostile to Judaism found a logical conclusion in the Marcionite movement, which completely separated Christianity from Judaism. On the other side, a more moderate and mystical approach led by Valentinus sought to reconcile different views by incorporating them into a universal framework, explaining contradictions through secret teachings claimed to come from the Savior Himself.

The main idea of this conciliatory movement, likely always present in the innermost circles, is perhaps best seen today in the system of Basilides. However, the gaps in Basilides' system, or those not mentioned by Hippolytus, were filled with countless creations by the Gnostics, who aimed for a complete exposition of their universal science. They integrated various aspects of ancient Gnosticism and the beliefs of old religions and philosophies, updating them with new revelations and sometimes retaining old names or inventing new ones. This synthesis of Gnosticism was largely driven by the genius of Valentinus. His technical works are said to have been very complex and difficult to understand due to the nature of his task.

What happened to these writings? No Church Father seems to have known any of his technical treatises; we only have a few ethical fragments from his letters and sermons. What about the followers of Valentinus, whom Church Fathers and critics blame for a chaotic Valentinian system? Did they have manuscripts of Valentinus's work, or did they rely on general ideas from his lectures?

Did Valentinus create a consistent system of Gnosis, or did he offer several alternatives due to the complexity and many possible perspectives on the matter? If the Pistis Sophia document and the other two Codices can provide any insight, it would greatly enhance our knowledge of this important period. If not, we must remain in the dark until new documents are found.

In the meantime, we should focus on the definite traces of Valentinus and the broader movement. Before doing so, we need to briefly review our sources among the Church Fathers. I will mainly follow Lipsius, a leading authority on the subject, who significantly advanced critical investigations into our Gnostic sources by analyzing The Panarion of Epiphanius. Tertullian tells us that before him, four orthodox defenders had already attempted to refute the Valentinians: Justin Martyr, Miltiades, Irenaeus, and the Montanist Proculus. Except for Irenaeus's five books, the rest of these writings are lost.

Irenaeus wrote his work around A.D. 185-195. He dedicates most of his first book to the Valentinians and includes mentions of them in the remaining four books. Irenaeus claims to have encountered certain notes of the Valentinians and had conversations with some of their members. However, these notes were only from the followers of Ptolemaeus, and only a short fragment is attributed to a writing by Ptolemaeus himself. The personal conversations were also held with followers of the same teacher, likely in the Rhone area—a place not particularly suitable for spreading the complex beliefs of Gnosticism, despite the "martyrs of Lyons."

When discussing Marcus, Irenaeus mostly relied on unreliable oral accounts, but he also seems to have had access to a memoir by a follower of Marcus. Marcus himself had lived and worked in Asia Minor years earlier. In chapter eleven, Irenaeus claims to describe the teachings of Valentinus, but he is actually copying from the work of an earlier critic. Lipsius also notes that Irenaeus took some of his initial statements from the same source as Clement did in The Excerpts from Theodotus. This indicates that Irenaeus's work is a confusing mix, and the true teachings of Valentinus are not clearly presented in The Refutation by the Bishop of Lyons.

Our next source of information comes from The Excerpts from the otherwise unknown Theodotus, which Lipsius believes might have been part of the first book of Clement's lost work, The Outlines. These excerpts have been so thoroughly rearranged and mixed with Clement's own comments and discussions that it's very difficult to understand them. Additionally, when Lipsius divides these extracts between the Eastern and Western schools, he essentially tells us to disregard the traditional title—Extracts from the (Books) of Theodotus and the so-called Anatolic School. So, once again, we are dealing with a confusing compilation. In his lost work, which we can piece together from summaries by Pseudo-Tertullian, Philaster, and Epiphanius, he seems to have mixed the first seven chapters of Irenaeus with another account, making the chaos even worse.

Hippolytus, in his invaluable document, The Philosophumena, provides a completely independent account. This is actually the most consistent and comprehensive description of the Gnosis of the Valentinian cycle that has survived through the writings of the early Church Fathers. Tertullian mostly copied from Irenaeus, and so did Epiphanius. However, Epiphanius preserved the famous Letter of Ptolemaeus to Flora and a list of "barbarous names" of the aeons that aren't found elsewhere. Theodoret also simply copied from Irenaeus and Epiphanius. So, our indirect sources for understanding the Valentinian movement are numerous but unreliable, requiring careful and critical examination.

Now, let's turn back to Valentinus himself and try to reconstruct, from the remaining fragments, a rough outline of a character universally acknowledged as the greatest among the Gnostics.

Valentinus: Regarding his biography, we know very little. Valentinus was an Egyptian, educated in Alexandria, where he learned everything Egypt and Greece had to offer. The ancient wisdom of Egypt, the teachings of Pythagoras, and the philosophy of Plato all shaped his character. However, his greatest inspiration came from the emerging stream of Christianity. But what kind of Christianity did Valentinus encounter in Alexandria? There was no Catechetical School when he was young. At that time, Pantaenus and Clement had not yet emerged. There were the sayings of the Lord and various contradictory traditions.

A Pauline community, likely founded by a missionary from Asia Minor, existed along with numerous legends about the secret knowledge (Gnosis) that Jesus had taught to those who could understand. However, the most significant influence came from the inner schools and communities dedicated to wisdom traditions and Gnosis.

Valentinus was likely very close to Basilides, although he claimed that a certain Theodas, an "apostolic man," was his source for the direct tradition of Gnosis. Nothing is known about this Theodas or Theudas, and Ussher even suggested that it might be a shortened form of Theodotus, a theory supported by Zahn. If this theory is correct, it would imply that Theodotus, mentioned in the excerpts by Clement, was an older authority than Valentinus himself, which would complicate the understanding of the origins of Valentinian thought and the distinction between Eastern and Western schools of Gnosticism. However, this theory is not entirely improbable and could clarify several important points.

In Alexandria, within the great library and private collections of mystics, there were many sources of information. The intellectual and religious environment of the city fostered a blend of ideas that encouraged the creation of a universal system of religion. Valentinus aimed to synthesize the various phases of Gnosis into a cohesive whole. Despite this, he did not intend to oppose or abandon the general Christian faith, nor did he seek to distance himself from what would later be known as the Catholic Church. It is likely that he remained a Catholic Christian throughout his life.

It is true that Tertullian mentions Valentinus’ excommunication, along with the common claim that he left the Church because he was denied a position as bishop. Tertullian thought this happened in Rome. But even if that were true, did Rome represent the entire Catholic Church in those early days? Would Alexandria, known for its philosophy, accept Rome’s disciplinary decisions? Or did Rome excommunicate Valentinus after his death, a common practice for settling disputes later on? Or is Tertullian exaggerating, as he often did? Epiphanius clearly states that Valentinus was considered orthodox while he was in Rome, and Tertullian himself mentions that Valentinus remained orthodox for fifteen years after leaving Rome.

Valentinus seems to have spent most of his life in Egypt. However, if our sources are accurate, he was also in Rome for a significant time, between 138 and 160. One source even says he was in Cyprus. The exact date of his death is unknown; most critics estimate it around 161. However, they dismiss Tertullian’s clear statement that Valentinus was still orthodox up to the time of Eleutherus (around 175), and Origen’s claim that he knew Valentinus personally. This would push Origen's birth date back and move Valentinus’ death date forward. Since both dates are uncertain, adjusting them by about ten years should not be a problem.

Overall, I believe Valentinus lived during the first eighty years of the second century. To further support this lengthy discussion, I invite readers to consider the extraordinary fact that, although the name Valentinus was widely known during his time and his fame surpassed that of any other figure in this significant Gnostic period, there are almost no records of his words and deeds. Even more surprisingly, for most of his life, he was considered orthodox. This unusual fact needs an explanation, which I suggest lies in Valentinus's exceptional secrecy and reserve. He was a mystery not just to the general public, but even to his followers. His approach to Gnosticism aimed to anticipate "orthodoxy" and include everything, even the most rigid traditions of the Master.

Valentinus recognized the great popular movement and its complexities as part of a larger spiritual outpouring and dedicated his life to uniting both external and internal elements into a cohesive whole. He likely realized at the end of his life that his goal was impossible for that era. Very few people could understand or appreciate his ideals. His technical writings were never published; only his letters and sermons were shared. After leaving Rome, he virtually disappeared from the view of Western scholars. Where he went, what he did, and how long he lived afterward remain largely speculative. However, if it is ever proven that documents like the Pistis Sophia came from his circle, we can speculate that he returned to Alexandria, where he spent his final years in the solitude needed for such complex literary work.

We know very little about his writings, except that they were numerous and his technical treatises very difficult and complex. He wrote many Letters, Homilies, and Psalms. It is also said that he wrote a Gospel, but this is believed to be false—false if by Gospel we mean a Gospel containing the Sayings of the Lord. However, could it be that "Gospel" here is used in the Basilidian sense, meaning an exposition of Gnosis or knowledge of the things beyond the physical world?

Tertullian tells us that Valentinus wrote a treatise called "Sophia" or "Wisdom." Some critics argue that Tertullian's words do not refer to a book but to the Wisdom that Valentinus claimed to teach. However, if this were the case, the comparison Tertullian makes between the Wisdom of Valentinus and the Wisdom of Solomon would lose its significance. The Wisdom of Solomon is a book, so the Wisdom of Valentinus should also be a book. If it were intended to mean simply the Gnosis which Valentinus taught, then the proper comparison would have been the Wisdom of God, not Solomon.

Now, we will discuss the few fragments of this prolific writer's works that have survived in the writings of the Church Fathers. The latest collection of these fragments is by Hilgenfeld (1884), although we will not always follow his "emendations." The fragments include a few scraps of letters and homilies preserved by Clement of Alexandria, and two pieces in The Philosophumena—a narrative of a vision and a piece of a psalm.

1. From a Letter:

> As the angels were filled with fear when they heard the creature speak of things greater than themselves, due to the hidden presence of the Logos (the divine word) within it, a similar fear occurs among humans. The works created by humans, like statues and images meant to represent God, also become a source of terror for their creators. This is because Adam, made in the image of the Heavenly Man (the Logos), spread the fear of this pre-existing divine presence, as it truly existed within him. The powers were terrified and quickly tried to ruin their creation.

This passage describes the Gnostic myth of human creation, which aligns with the broader Gnostic tradition. The primitive form of man, initially unable to stand or walk (similar to the embryonic form described by Plato in his work "Timaeus"), is developed by natural forces through evolution. Into this form, God breathes the mind, instantly elevating man above the rest of creation and its forces. However, man's body remains weak, and the natural powers, fearing the divine mind within him (the "name" of the Heavenly Man), wage war against him.

Gradually, the human mind learns to overcome these powers. The Heavenly Man represents the perfect model for all humanity, and the "name" signifies the unique essence that determines the nature and identity of every being. Man alone on Earth possesses this divine essence within him. The prehistoric world, with which Egypt had direct traditional contact, valued the concept of a "name" greatly. Statues, talismans, and amulets, if crafted in a certain way, were believed to closely represent the ideal type of man or nature. It was thought that the "name" of a divine power was bestowed on these creations by a divine being who communicates directly. This gives us insight into how ancient priests explained "idol-worship," an idea later integrated into universal knowledge by Valentinus.

2. From a Letter:

> Only one being is truly good and reveals Himself through His Son. It is through Him alone that the heart can become pure, but only after all evil essences are expelled. The heart’s purity is hindered by various essences residing in it, each performing its own deeds and corrupting it with unseemly desires. The heart is like an inn with broken walls, often filled with filth because people do not care for it as it belongs to someone else. Similarly, the heart remains unclean and inhabited by many evil spirits until the Good Father takes notice of it. When He does, the heart is sanctified and shines with light. A person with such a heart is blessed and 'shall see God.'

This doctrine, also taught by Basilides and Isidorus about the soul's "attachments," was noted by Clement and was an ancient belief in Egypt. In the Book of the Dead, it is mentioned that the "heart" represents a distinct personality within a person (similar to the "man in the aether of the heart" in the Upanishads). It explains that it is not the heart that sins but its physical form. Isidorus, as noted earlier, did not blame the "appendages" but held the "heart" itself responsible, referring to it as the "ancestral heart" or the "guardian of my flesh"—the reincarnating entity. However, it is acknowledged that passions are linked to the blood and the physical heart, which is where the true "heart" is believed to reside.

3. From the Letter to Agathopus:

True expression of the Good can only be shown by a perfect person. Jesus was such an individual. Valentinus wrote to Agathopus saying: "Through constant self-denial, Jesus achieved godhood; he ate and drank in a unique way, without waste. His self-control was so strong that his food did not decay in him, for he was without decay."

It's noted that the body can adapt to very little food, and many holy ascetics in the East have survived on minimal sustenance. The "power" Valentinus described is one of the siddhis (spiritual powers) mentioned in yoga texts, and the Upanishads state that "very little waste" is an early sign of success in yoga. We are told that at the highest levels, once the body's particles have been fully refined and controlled by the ascetic's will, a higher form of matter can gradually replace the current body. These ideas, among others, influenced the doctrine of docetism, which was a key part of Gnosticism.

Clement and some other early Christian Fathers held similar views.

4. From a Homily:

> From the beginning, you have been immortal and children of eternal life, like the aeons. Yet you chose to share in death, to conquer it, so that death might die through you. As you dissolve the world without being dissolved yourself, you become masters of all creation and destruction.

This teaching, found in the Codex Brucianus and the Pistis Sophia texts, emphasizes overcoming the world rather than being overcome by it. It reminds us that we are gods and lords. The divine spark within, the inner light, is the eternal pilgrim incarnated in matter. Those who are aware of this inner light are the spiritual ones, to whom Valentinus speaks.

5. A few sentences from a writing of Valentinus, preserved in Clement's controversial works:

> The "elect race," the third Sonship of Basilides, has incarnated to abolish "death," the realm of the ruler of the physical world, the samsara of Buddhist and Indian philosophers, and Plato's "ever-becoming" realm. This ruler is the God of the Old Testament, who said, "No man shall see the face of God and live.

This is the face of death, but there is also a face of life, which Valentinus describes:

> Just as the dead image is far removed from the living face, so is the physical world distant from the living realm of true reality. What then causes the image? The majesty of the living face (or person), which serves as a model for the painter. This model ensures that the universe is honored by its name—the true essence of the divine majesty. The authentic nature isn't found in the form; the name completes what's missing. The invisible nature of deity helps to inspire faith in what has been created.

This idea is similar to Fragment 1 and likely comes from the same Letter. The "painter" represents those who use the creative forces of the physical world, copying from the ideas in the true reality. According to Valentinus, the God and Father referred to by the Jews is actually the "image and prophet of the true God," with "prophet" meaning someone who speaks for and interprets. The "image" is created by Sophia or Wisdom, who transfers the ideas from the true reality to the physical world. The "true God" or "God of truth" is the creator of the true reality, which holds the essence of all things. He is the god of life; the "image" is the god of death.

"All things that come from a pair (or synergy) are fullnesses (pleromata), but those from a single aeon are just images." This will be explained later; it refers to the "fall" of Sophia from the realm of true reality, which led to the creation of the physical universe. The following remarks by Clement are almost unintelligible; they discuss the coming of the "excellent" spirit and the infusion of the light-spark into man.

6. From the Letter on the Community of Friends

Many of the teachings found in public writings are also found in the Church of God. These teachings, common to all, are heartfelt and represent the law written in the heart. This is the community of believers who love and are loved by God. Clement interprets "public writings" as Jewish texts and philosophical works.

For Valentinus, however, "public writings" included not only Jewish and philosophical texts but also the scriptures of all religions, including widely read Christian documents. He argues that the only universal truths are those related to the Community of Friends or Saints, the Church of God, the People of the Beloved. These truths come from the heart. Valentinus rejects the narrow view that truth is confined to a single set of scriptures, stating that truth can be found in all scriptures and philosophies if one understands the spirit rather than the literal words.

7. A Very Doubtful Fragment from Eulogius of Alexandria

If this fragment is genuine, it tells us that early Christians, whom Valentinus calls "the Galileans of the time of Christ," believed in the doctrine of two natures. In contrast, the Valentinians believed there was only one nature. This aligns with Isidorus's arguments about the unified consciousness of the soul and its responsibility, as well as Valentinus's teaching that Jesus developed his own divinity.

8. The Myth Created by Valentinus

Hippolytus (II.) inserts the following scrap of information in the middle of his extensive description of Marcus's system, which he copied from Irenaeus:

> Valentinus says he once saw a newborn child and questioned it to find out who it was. The child replied that it was the Logos." According to Hippolytus, Valentinus added a "tragic myth" to this story, which became the foundation of his teachings. Is this an incident from the introduction to one of Valentinus's writings? And is the "tragic myth" his version of the great Sophia myth, which was central to his cosmology.

9. From a Psalm:

Finally, from the same source, "The Philosophumena," we recover these lines. It is likely that Hippolytus got them from the same treatise where he found the previous information. The Psalm seems to explain why the newborn child was the Logos, why "this" is "That," as the Upanishads say, and how all is one:

> All things depending in spirit I see;
>
> All things supported in spirit I view;
>
> Flesh depending on soul;
>
> Soul supported by air;
>
> Air hanging from aether--
>
> Fruits borne of the deep--
>
> Babe borne of the womb.

Whether this mystical Psalm was meant as we have suggested is uncertain. Such mystical statements can be interpreted both on a personal (microcosmic) and universal (macrocosmic) level. Hippolytus claims to provide a Valentinian interpretation from the latter perspective.

The "flesh" represents the material world (the Hebdomad according to Basilides); the "soul" is linked to the Demiurge (the "material" force of the aetheric spaces, the Ogdoad of Basilides). The Demiurge is connected to the Spirit, which acts as the Great Boundary, separating the Pleroma (the realm of reality) from the Kenoma (the phenomenal universe).

From another perspective, this Spirit is Sophia (Wisdom), in the middle realm. Therefore, the Demiurge is connected to Sophia, Sophia to the Great Boundary (Horos), and Horos to the Pleroma, the Blessed Treasure of the aeons. This world of ideas, or Living Aeon, ultimately derives from the Abyss or Great Depth, the Father, the God beyond existence. This describes the Valentinian chain of being, which is so complex and convoluted that no one has managed to create a consistent interpretation from the chaotic and contradictory accounts in the writings of the Church Fathers.

In the manuscript of The Philosophumena, the above fragment is introduced by the word "Harvest." Hilgenfeld, therefore, refers to Valentinus "hymning the Great Harvest," a grand idea that is difficult to connect with the quoted lines. This is the limited information we have about what Valentinus actually taught—only nine, or rather eight, fragments in total. Yet, these fragments are filled with vibrant, lively words amidst the dull rhetoric of his critics.

It might be appropriate to add the account that Irenaeus copied from an earlier heresiological writer. It is commonly believed that this earlier source was Justin Martyr, but whoever he was, he merely summarized and even at that early stage (around 150 AD), struggled with the conflicting accounts he had heard about the "Valentinian" Gnosis. Therefore, I consider this source no more significant than other summaries of general Valentinian doctrine found in the writings of the Church Fathers.

We learn nothing certain about the teachings of Valentinus himself, which is our current focus. Thus, we bid farewell to this "great unknown" of Gnosticism, whose name was the most famous, whose influence was the most extensive, and whose doctrines were so vibrant that the varied interpretations by his followers and the confused summaries by the Church Fathers have baffled scholars.

This confusion arises because, in trying to bring order to this chaos, people have followed words and terms instead of ideas. This happens not only with the Valentinian ideas but also with every other phase of Gnosis. These misleading guides have often been followed as if they were pathways out of a labyrinth.

However, the thread that leads us out of the maze is made of ideas, not names. The Gnostics constantly changed their terminology; the god of one system might even be the devil of another! Anyone who compiles a list of names in Gnosticism might end up confused, but those who seek the ideas behind the names will often discover a realm of great beauty and harmony of thought. Gnostics have always had insights into a true state of being and specific realms of consciousness, but each has only had a glimpse of reality, as all people do while they are confined to a body.

If the Gnostics of their time tried to find a suitable representation for the truth as they saw it, who can blame them? Even if they contradict each other, from a word-hunter's perspective, they don’t contradict themselves in the eyes of those who follow ideas. The idea is the key to understanding the mysteries of Gnosis, and those who refuse to use this key must accept that the knowledge will remain inaccessible to them.

Before discussing the followers of Valentinus, we will attempt to extract some main ideas from the chaotic summaries of the Valentinian cycle of Gnosis. If we were to combine all these conflicting accounts and analyze them critically, the general reader, for whom these writings are intended, might either give up in frustration or become so confused that they would forget what has already been explained and be unable to understand what comes next. Such technical analysis should be addressed elsewhere. For now, we will not attempt to fully explain the system of the followers of Valentinus—if they even had a single definite system—but instead, we will outline some of their ideas on aeonology.

To elevate our thoughts towards the profound issues that occupied the minds of these Gnostics, we should revisit the outline of the Basilidian system previously provided. To understand the universe, we must first consider our world, Earth, and then think about the spaces below the moon, both visible and invisible. From there, we move beyond the moon into the ethereal regions filled with stars and their countless inhabitants, different spaces, and hierarchies.

At the edge of these regions lies the Great Firmament, a boundary that separates the observable universe from the true reality beyond space and time. This boundary exists everywhere but in no specific place. Here, we leave behind time and space and enter a realm of paradox, where we must describe it using familiar terms, even though they don't fully capture its essence. We call it the Living Aeon, though it surpasses all life; we refer to it as the Light-world, though its light is too brilliant for human eyes. This is the Pleroma, a world of perfection, perfect forms, and perfect harmony. The mind cannot fully grasp it, but the spirit urges us to continue forward. In this realm, there are no words or symbols; only silence and peace in the presence of the Divine.

Some Gnostics are said to have started with the idea of Bythus, or the Abyss of Profundity, but this is incorrect. Basilides had already shown that it was impossible to name the God beyond all things. The Valentinians did not miss this point; some of them taught about a hierarchy of Deeps beyond the Abyss. This concept is found in the Codex Brucianus and the Pistis Sophia treatise. How absurd it is to seek a "beginning" in the infinite! A beginning is a concept that applies to lower levels of existence. We can talk about the beginning of a specific universe, but there are countless universes, and infinity itself has no beginning. Beyond the Pleroma, the ideal model of all universes, there is—what? Silences more profound than silence itself and depths deeper than the deep!

The Valentinians would have laughed at the idea of categorizing their understanding of what lies beyond existence into monistic or dualistic theories, and using this to split them into Eastern and Western schools. Yet, this is what Hippolytus and many modern critics have done. We should leave the mystery in the Silence of that Depth beyond Being—a Silence that separates the Pleroma from the Depth beyond Being with a higher boundary than the Great Firmament. This highest boundary was within the deepest parts of the Pleroma itself, the inner world, just as the Great Boundary was beyond the depths of the external phenomenal world.

The concept of "depth" moves us away from three-dimensional matter as we know it and introduces the idea of "through" in every direction simultaneously, inside and out. Next, we need to discuss the "being" of the Pleroma of the aeons. Each "being" in this "Fullness of Being" (Pleroma) was, in turn, a "fullness" or perfection, and their names reflected their nature. They were called aeons or "eternities" because they existed outside of time and space. Everything outside the Pleroma, meaning everything in the phenomenal universe, was merely an "image" or deficiency. Thus, the phenomenal world was referred to by names like the Kenoma or "Emptiness," the Image, and so on.

It's clear that until we encounter the phenomenal world, no human language can express modes of existence that go beyond cosmic operations. Yet, the boldness of the Gnostic thinkers required them to find a way to hint at the nature of the aeons, which were believed to exist beyond time and space. Let's explore one of the methods they used. The Gnostics did not work their way up from below; they received knowledge from above and brought it into the physical realm. Essentially, their explanations were attempts to describe a living symbol shown to them in visions.

Pythagoras, Plato, and the teachers of the Mysteries taught that physical matter was ultimately geometric in nature, asserting that "God geometrizes" in all things. The five regular solids represented the pinnacle of geometric knowledge in the Platonic school, which is why these shapes are known as the Platonic Solids. Proclus stated that Euclid's Elements were merely an introduction to the science of these perfect solids. These polyhedra were believed to underpin not only the formation of the earth but also every genus, species, and individual in the material universe.

It's surprising that the study of regular solids has been so neglected in mathematics, and modern thinkers often dismiss the ancients' focus on them as trivial. For recent advancements and detailed work on this subject, I refer the interested reader to the works of a young Spanish scientist, Senor Soria y Mata. Of course, anyone who is completely unfamiliar with the subject won't fully understand the following general points. Just like signposts show directions without guiding the traveler, our task here is to provide indications, not detailed guidance. Those needing more in-depth help should refer to Señor Soria's excellent essays.

For now, we are just setting up signposts, so let's get back to it.

Someone might ask, even if the five solids (which are just variations of one thing in different combinations) are connected to the basic elements forming the unseen molecular structure of matter, what does that have to do with the Valentinian Gnostics? The answer is, quite a lot. Marcus, an early follower of Valentinus, is associated with a system of mystical numbering. Hippolytus (2) states that all of Valentinianism was based on the numbers and geometry of Pythagoras and Plato. However, no solid evidence supports this broad claim, and no scholar has provided the missing link. Still, it's entirely believable that the aeonology (study of aeons) of the Valentinian School was partly based on these ideas.

#### Valentinus

Let's try to make some suggestions on this topic, not from Marcus' numbering system but from the living principles of Pythagorean and Platonic mathematics. This "mathesis," which was the same as "gnosis," is said to have been called by Pythagoras himself as "the knowledge of things that are." Perhaps some Gnostic thinkers used this line of thought to develop a symbolic understanding of the nature of the aeons.

From the realm of definite polyhedral matter, whose organization, though invisible to the eye, could be imagined in the mind, the symbolism was extended further—moving from the molecular to what we now call the atomic level. The regular solids represented physical matter in a state of perfect balance of "points" in space. These points were not just abstract mathematical concepts but actual centers of force, balanced by a law of polarity or syzygy. This was the domain of the atom.

The atom was viewed as a living force, a sphere, sometimes described as a spherical swirl, the most perfect figure. It continuously contracted and expanded, generating all motions while being self-motive and, from another perspective, "immovable," being part of the "foundations of earth." It is smaller than the smallest matter, yet greater than the greatest energy. The atom and its combinations were what the Valentinian Gnosis considered in its study of aeons.

However, I do not suggest that any Gnostic philosopher thought of the atom as modern physicists do; rather, I believe the most advanced Gnostics were shown this living symbol of world-formation in visions, and their various systems were attempts to explain such visions. Any symbol is vastly different from reality, but trying to imagine or being shown the living essence beyond the simplest physical forms is closer to reality than any inert physical shape. Thus, the atom and its simplest forms of differentiated being can be seen as symbols of the aeon-world, the Pleroma, the world of life and light beyond time and space, the unchanging heart of the eternities.

This perspective may interest students of symbolism, who usually focus only on flat shapes and thus deal with what could be called "shadows of the dead." A flat shape is essentially just a shadow of a solid object; it is the living system of forces behind or within the solid that represents the first spark of life.

To understand this better, let's consider a familiar symbol: the interlaced triangles, also known as "Solomon's Seal." In three dimensions, this symbol is represented by two interpenetrating tetrahedra. From this union come the cube and octahedron. The dodecahedron and icosahedron emerge from the interaction of five tetrahedra. Thus, we have our five regular solids. The fundamental shape is the tetrahedron, and the force system behind it consists of two pairs of atoms in perfect equilibrium. The relationship and interaction of these atoms define the life or essence of the symbol. When this is understood, the symbol becomes alive, and the forces that the "shadow" of the "dead" solid symbolizes are revealed to the one who solves the "mystery."

In ancient magic, especially in Egypt, this idea was extended in very complex ways beyond geometric symbols. Most practitioners of the art had no understanding of the reasons behind their rituals. For the general public, magic was never a rational practice but consisted of countless "rules of thumb." Consequently, this aspect is often, and rightly, seen as superstition by today's intelligent inquiry. The intelligent student of symbolism should therefore strive to think beyond the limits of three-dimensional space and consider the so-called "fourth dimension."

To grasp the concept of aeonic being, which is crucial for students of Gnosticism yet challenging, try this thought exercise:

Imagine an atom or monad as a sphere that expands from a point and then contracts back to that point, illustrating the idea of position.

Now, consider two such spheres at the same level of expansion, making them equal. Place them so they touch each other; this can be done in countless ways, in any direction relative to each other. Imagine these spheres as mathematical points, giving us the simplest idea of a line, one-dimensional.

Next, take three similar spheres and place them so they all touch each other. Think of them as points, forming a plane, which is two-dimensional.

Then, take four such spheres, bring them into mutual contact, and reduce them to points. Their positions now require three-dimensional space.

Finally, try to imagine five spheres all touching each other. This isn't possible in three dimensions and requires a new idea, something related to the spheres' content—an idea of "through."

This isn't exactly a "fourth dimension" but rather a complex perception, revisiting the steps we've taken so far. For example, normal vision perceives three-dimensional space as being bounded by surfaces. However, those with "four-dimensional" vision claim that the contents of an object—like a watch—appear spread out before them in a way that is hard to understand, as if displayed on a surface. If this is true, then three-dimensional space is the pivotal link in our understanding. At this point, consciousness turns inward toward the origin, which, when fully realized, becomes an infinite boundary or complete consciousness—similar to the concept of the "nirvanic atom."

Now, let's try to imagine how ancient Gnostics visualized the ideal universe, which serves as a model for all universes. They contemplated the primal atom or monad, its movements, and its ways of differentiating and emanating within itself. This concept aligns with Plato's world of ideas, the light-world of ancient Iran, the "eternal egg" from ancient Egypt, and the "resplendent germ" or hiranya-garbha of the Upanishads.

Leibnitz also described it in his Monadology. Essentially, they envisioned an infinite sphere of Light, far surpassing the brilliance of the sun. This Light is beyond human thought, and within it, there is a constant flow to and from the center, which is both everywhere and nowhere. It's a breath that continually expands and contracts, an endless energy that humans cannot perceive or understand. This is the Life-breath of the universe at the zero-point of existence, a concept familiar to some theosophical students.

Let's move on to what we can call a "change of state." It's important to remember that all these states we're trying to describe actually exist simultaneously. Even though we're thinking of it as a kind of progression or evolution, it's really an ever-present, infinite state of consciousness beyond time and space. In this constantly flowing field of universal energy, which is both everywhere and nowhere, something emerges that is slightly less brilliant than the transcendent Light. It's another form of movement, which we can imagine as an oval or egg-like swirl that expands and contracts.

Within this swirling motion, two "foci" gradually develop as it pulses and swells. The inner boundary of the egg-like shape contracts in the middle due to the influence of the two foci, which represent balance, positive and negative forces, and the principle of pairing. The two separate.

Bythus and Ennoea, representing Depth and Thought, form the first pair of aeons, symbolized now as two spheres. Although they are separate, they are mysteriously influenced by the great outward and inward breaths, and each reflects the qualities of the other. One is positive, the other negative, and these qualities are instantly communicated throughout the entire Light-sphere, being everywhere and nowhere simultaneously. This establishes polarity as a fundamental aspect of the Pleroma (the fullness of divine powers), affirming the law of pairing.

With the emergence of duality, multiplicity must follow, leading to universality. The Pleroma must simultaneously embody the One, the Many, and the All, supporting monotheism, polytheism, and pantheism. However, as we follow our symbolic imagery, we can't grasp the entire concept all at once.

We try to imagine that any process we understand through our symbols happens everywhere, all the time, and simultaneously with every other process and form of existence. However, we can't form a mental image of this. We can only move from one process to another by following the behavior of a single pair of our living symbols.

So, let's proceed. We have spheres evolving, each containing both positive and negative aspects within itself, but appearing positive or negative in relation to each other. In our thoughts, we will treat one sphere as positive and the other as negative, and try to imagine the changes that occur.

As these twin spheres expand and contract, they touch, and from the negative sphere, a "veil" or "mist" emerges and seems to line the great Light-sphere. This demonstrates the law of densification and continuous differentiation.

With each contraction, the negative sphere becomes less light and more passive, although in reality, the "lowest" aeon far surpasses the brightest radiance in the universe. The negative light-sphere produces offspring and differentiates its substance, influenced by the positive light-sphere. In other words, the Light-world is divided into different "planes" of existence, with "veils" and "firmaments."

But how many are there, and what are they like? For more details, I must refer you to Señor Soria's essays on the polyhedric origin of species, which discuss the possible series of physical systems with perfect equilibrium of spheres of equal diameter, starting from two and increasing. This is a fascinating problem for further exploration. For now, it is enough to state that the first aeonic hierarchy of the Valentinian Pleroma is said to have been an ogdoad, or group of eight, sometimes viewed as a dual tetrad—a system of equilibrium involving two interlinked tetrahedra.

An important point that shouldn't be overlooked comes from considering the ogdoadic mode of the Pleroma. Bythus and Ennoea are no longer seen as a single pair; Ennoea, the negative sphere, has given birth. She now represents "seven-robed" Nature, or Isis, while Bythus is the Great Deep or "Water-whirl," Osiris, the anchor. The negative sphere has now become seven spheres (herself and six others like her and the positive sphere)—three pairs of aeons. This represents the single sphere of sameness and the seven spheres of difference, according to Pythagorean and Platonic philosophy. This also aligns with the Ogdoad and Hebdomad of Basilides.

After establishing the law of duality (syzygy), we then see the law of triplicity in the three syzygies into which the negative sphere is divided. These are the three major stages or areas of the Pleroma, and their syzygies, or modes of polarity, are called Mind-Truth, Word-Life, and Man-Church, for reasons that are somewhat unclear and will be discussed later.

Next, we learn about a group of twelve aeons and a group of ten aeons, which come from one of the syzygies of the ogdoad. The stories of their origin are contradictory; sometimes the group of ten is placed before the group of twelve. Since ten naturally comes before twelve, critics have unanimously preferred this order. In such confusion, it's all speculative, but experience suggests the less likely account might actually be correct. Why else would some Valentinians place the twelve before the ten unless their symbolism required it?

We will now consider the main stages of the Pleroma as represented by the ogdoad (eight), the dodecad (twelve), and the decad (ten). These stages did not arise from one another in reality; they all existed together eternally. However, they are depicted in a dramatic myth, one version of which we will soon present.

The ogdoad refers to the processes symbolized by two interlocking tetrahedra, encompassing all the variations of their complementary offspring (the cube and the octahedron). Thus, the ogdoad was divided into an upper and lower four, and in other ways, including the one and the seven as mentioned earlier.

The one and the seven can be illustrated by the geometric fact that if you take seven equal circles, with six arranged around a central one, each circle will touch its neighboring circles and the one in the middle. A larger circle can encompass all seven. This is just a symbolic representation, mainly serving as a memory aid. However, such natural facts were highly regarded by the Platonists, especially when they involved perfect shapes like circles and spheres, which symbolize perfection or fullness.

We have now reached a point where the original simplicity is represented by groups of twelve; the Pleroma is now symbolized by the dodecad. It's interesting to note that if we imagine space filled with spheres of equal size, each touching the others, each sphere would be surrounded by exactly twelve others. If these spheres were elastic and pressure was applied equally from all sides, the central sphere would form into a dodecagonal shape, specifically a rhombic dodecahedron.

There's frequent mention of a "thirteenth aeon," which has puzzled many commentators. Pythagoreans, Platonists, and Indian philosophers claimed that the dodecahedron symbolized the material universe. Some modern psychics or clairvoyants also say that an atom's field of activity is a rhombic dodecahedron. The twelve signs of the zodiac have been seen as an irrational hypothesis, but considering the importance of the dodecahedron might give us new insights.

Each phase of the Pleroma (the fullness of divine powers) is believed to be positive compared to the next phase. The Pleroma as a whole is positive compared to the dyadic stage (a stage of duality); in this stage, Bythus is positive to Ennoea, who then diversifies into seven. The seven is positive to the dodecad stage, which has thirteen spheres.

If we think of the dodecad as a dodecahedron, we are dealing with the physical universe, not the Pleroma. The living type behind this in the aeon-world is the system of thirteen spheres that result in the dodecahedron in the physical world. Each of these thirteen contains the seven modes of being from the previous phase, creating a multitude of forms in every system of thirteen. These are the children of a phase of existence we can call the "multiplicity of sameness," which means an ocean of identical, neighboring spheres. These spheres eventually change and arrange themselves into a harmonious, perfect form represented by the number ten, known as the decad.

So, how do we move from the number twelve (dodecad) to the number ten (decad), from basic matter to a perfect form? Perhaps it happens like this:

Every sphere is alive, moving in all directions simultaneously, and yet in another sense, it is still. The types of external movement are up, down, right, left, backward, forward, and circular—seven in total. To these, we add inward and outward movements, along with an imagined state of no motion. This brings us to a new phase of existence through the decad or ten, which marks the beginning of another series of higher-level motions (1, 2, 3, etc., followed by 11, 12, 13, etc.).

The seven motions, or ways of life, in every system of thirteen spheres, are simple in the larger sphere that surrounds them—the fourteenth sphere or boundary of the system. In the smaller, subordinate thirteen spheres, these motions interact with each other (since each sphere touches many others), creating additional modes of movement, totaling 91 (7 * 13).

Adding the seven basic motions as rulers gives us 98 (91 + 7) different modes. Including the two higher modes (inward and outward motion), we get a total of 100. This number, 100, represents the perfection (10 * 10) of the perfect number (10). Later, we will see how the Gnostics, in perfecting their concept of the Pleroma, found it necessary to add two more spiritual beings, thereby incorporating Christ and the Holy Spirit into their myth of the Pleroma drama.

So, the number 100 was reached through the development of the numbers eight and twelve, by adding two new factors or through a new combination, leading to ten, the number of completion. The number of root aeons in the Pleroma was said to be thirty (8 + 12 + 10). Adding Christ and the Holy Spirit—representing Bythus and Sige (Silence) beyond the Pleroma—and the ultimate source beyond all, we get thirty-three. This matches the Vedic pantheon of thirty-three deities: the 8 Vasus, 12 Adityas, and 10 Rudras, with a supreme Rudra, and Heaven and Earth. The number 100 also helps explain the ordering of the different phases of the Pleroma, as mentioned in the system attributed to the Docetae by Hippolytus, which includes the "thirty-fold, sixty-fold, and one hundred-fold."

#### Aeonology

I don't suggest these speculations were the foundation of Gnostic aeonology; I believe the Gnostics saw their aeon-lore through visions and found similarities in nature and contemporary science. Pythagoras also, I believe, was shown these truths and expressed them in mathematical symbols. The Gnostics knew the system of his followers—a system we only have fragments of today—and used his theological arithmetic and geometry to support their explanations. However, this was just one of many methods they used.

But to continue with our discussion of aeonology, how did the imperfection or deficiency of cosmic matter come from the perfection of the Pleroma (since each aeon was a perfection or pleroma in its own right), which would serve as the substance from which the "images" or "creatures" of the universe were to be formed?

So far, the living symbol of the Pleroma has produced perfect spheres, all in pairs, consisting of a light and a "darker" globe. The twelve and ten, just like the eight, are made up of pairs. The light globes have acted on the "darker" ones, creating various phases. But now a new change occurs.

"Dark" globes interact, resulting in an amorphous mass instead of a perfect sphere. This mass is somewhat outside the Pleroma, being of a lower nature. When this happens, the whole system tries to correct itself, similar to how the organs and cells of the human body react when something goes wrong.

The Pleroma is considered the spiritual body of the Heavenly Man. However, the various aeons cannot achieve their goal individually; they must combine to act on the "formlessness." Each of the thirty aeons emits a ray, and these rays together form a new aeon or light globe. This new globe shapes the amorphous mass, enters it, and finally integrates it back into the system. This represents the world-drama, elaborated in great detail by the Gnostics.

To everything below the Pleroma, the Pleroma appears as one entity, containing all the powers of the aeons. It is the "living aeon" and acts upon cosmic matter, which is shapeless, giving it form and creating the universe. This process is called "enforming according to essence." There is also "enforming according to knowledge" or consciousness, which relates to the salvation aspect of the drama.

The idea was that the "abortion" or chaos lacked the life-force or vortex. The vortex is like a finger of fire or a spark of light, sent forth by the light-aeons during their positive phases. The negative realms cannot create or shape this spark; they can only solidify or materialize it.

The mother-breath cools, and the father-breath warms the universe's substance. This substance is cast from the ideal world into the cosmic plane, or more accurately, from the cosmic plane into the plane of a star-system. The human mind cannot fully understand the vastness of the ideal world, so we use a smaller, finite example from the infinite expanse of space.

Anything ejected from the cosmic sweep and the life of the aeons is "crucified in space"; in other words, it leaves the plane of infinity, where it is one with the Father, and is "crucified." The Logos takes on a body, and this body is the cosmos. The Heavenly Man is crucified in space. However, this crucifixion is not shameful or disgraceful; the cross represents the body of the Heavenly Man—the universe. The wise have chosen the symbol of the Heavenly Man with outstretched arms, pouring His life, love, and light into His creatures. He is the source of all good in the universe, continuously sacrificing Himself.

Further down the scale of existence, there is another crucifixion when the spirit incarnates into a plane where there is male and female, thereby becoming separated from the great life and motion of the Pleroma. The spirit in man is no longer consciously part of the grand sweep of the Great Breath, the Nirvanic Ocean of Life.

But let's return to cosmic substance and its formation. This substance is so fine and rare that it surpasses any substance we know. The mother-substance of the cosmos is so marvelous that the Gnostics called it Wisdom herself, the highest garment the spirit could wear. The initial source of wisdom comes from the combined energy of all ages, known as the Common Fruit of the Pleroma.

We have now reached the start of the universe's evolution according to this universal philosophy. However, to keep things manageable, let's focus on the beginning of a solar system instead of the whole cosmos. The spaces destined to become the future system are empty and without form. From the Pleroma, a stream of energy emerges, forming a spiral vortex—the Vast Whirlpool of Orpheus. This is the fiery creative power that purifies the spaces. It enters the formlessness, becoming the life-force or primordial atom it lacked, and shapes it from the outside.

The mother-substance becomes a sphere, filled with life, a rotating mass of stardust. The "atom" turns into the "flying serpent," or comet, which hovers over the mother-substance, the newborn system. This is like the sperm and egg of the solar embryo.

We have now reached the point where we must address the differentiation of this nebula according to the types in the Divine Mind, or the Pleroma. It is here that ancient intuitions and modern scientific discoveries should meet. I believe this union of past and present is closer than it seems, but this essay doesn't allow for a detailed discussion. The topic is very technical, and our current goal is simply to provide general readers with some interesting insights about the Gnostics.

We will pause here at the intersection of the study of aeons and the origin of the universe according to the Valentinian branch of Gnosticism. Before proceeding further, we will provide an example of their mythological approach to explaining the aeon-process.

As mentioned several times, the accounts from the Church Fathers are inconsistent and often contradictory in many details. We hope the summary we provided earlier will help clarify all accounts, but due to space constraints, we must choose one as an example. We will rely on Hippolytus (II.) for our selection, as he likely had a Gnostic manuscript in front of him and closely adhered to his sources more than his predecessors. Hippolytus' work in the "Philosophumena" may be based on a later writing compared to the "Excerpts from Theodotus," but it still reflects how a Gnostic viewed the matter, even though the "Excerpts" are severely damaged and disorganized.

Irenaeus' summary, on the other hand, is a poor patchwork at best. However, Hippolytus' account is also a patchwork, though it is evidently pieced together from some treatise within the private library of the Valentinian school. Before delving into Hippolytus' account, it might be helpful to give some background on the significant role of personified Wisdom in Gnostic mythology.

Wisdom was central to Gnosis, and the focal point of the entire Gnostic mythological narrative was the so-called Sophia-Myth. Whether these allegories are interpreted from a universal or individual perspective, they aim to teach us about the evolution of the mind. The creation and development of the world-mind in the universe, and the human mind in human history, are the main focus of the secret science.

According to our Gnostics, Sophia, as the World-Soul, resided in the Ogdoad, an intermediate realm between the upper spiritual worlds and the lower psychic and material worlds. Below the Ogdoad were the Hebdomad, or Seven Spheres of psychic substance. This aligns with the saying, "Wisdom has built her house and set it on seven pillars" (Proverbs 9:1). Another saying goes, "She is in the high places; she stands in the middle of the paths, for she sits by the gates of the powerful ones, waiting at the entrances [of the Light-World]" (Proverbs 8:2), reflecting Jewish tradition.

Furthermore, Sophia acted as a mediator between the upper and lower realms and projected the archetypes of the pleroma into the cosmos. But why was Wisdom, originally of a spiritual essence, positioned in the Middle Space, away from her true home? This was a key mystery that Gnosticism sought to understand.

The "Fall of the Soul" from its original purity led to suffering and misery, similar to the problem of "sorrow" that Gautama Buddha aimed to solve. Both systems identified "ignorance" as the cause of sorrow and pointed to the Path of Self-knowledge as the solution. The mind was to educate itself through "self-analysing reflection," purifying the material mind to unify with the spiritual mind. In Gnostic terms, this was symbolized by the redemption of Sophia by Christ, who saved her from ignorance and suffering.

It's not surprising that Sophia, in her various forms, has many names. Some of these include the Mother, All-Mother, Mother of the Living, Power Above, Holy Spirit, She of the Left-hand (as opposed to Christ, who is of the Right-hand), the Man-woman, Prouneikos (or Lustful one), the Matrix, Paradise, Eden, Achamoth, the Virgin, Barbelo, Daughter of Light, Merciful Mother, Consort of the Masculine One, Revealer of the Perfect Mysteries, Perfect Mercy, Revealer of the Mysteries of the Whole Magnitude, Hidden Mother, She who knows the Mysteries of the Elect, the Holy Dove who has given birth to Twins, Ennoea, Ruler, and the Lost or Wandering Sheep, Helena, among many other names. These names refer to Sophia or the "Soul" in her cosmic or individual forms, whether she is above in her perfect purity, in the middle as an intermediary, or below, fallen into matter.

Returning to the text:

#### Hippolytus' Account of One of the Variants of the Sophia Myth

"VALENTINUS, Heracleon, Ptolemaeus, and their school of Gnostics, followers of Pythagoras and Plato, based their teachings on 'arithmetical science.' For them, the beginning of all things is the Monad, which is uncreated, indestructible, incomprehensible, and the creator of all things. They call this Monad the Father. There is, however, some disagreement among them about its nature. Some say...The Father lacks any feminine aspect, has no counterpart, and is solitary.

Some believe that it is impossible for all creation to come from a single male principle. Therefore, they add the concept of Silence as a counterpart to the Father, so He can be considered a Father. However, whether Silence is a counterpart or not is a debate they need to resolve among themselves. Hippolytus misunderstood the matter; there were Fathers for each level of existence—monads or single states of being, and also Father-Mothers for dual states of being, and so on.

"In the beginning," says the Gnostic whose manuscript Hippolytus had, "nothing was created. The Father was alone, uncreated, without space, time, or anyone to consult, or any substantial nature that could be conceived. He was solitary and at rest, existing in Himself. But since He was creative, He eventually decided to create what was most beautiful and perfect in Himself. He was no longer content with being alone because He was all love, and love needs something to love.

Therefore, the Father, though alone, emanated and generated Mind-and-Truth, which is the dyad, and the Mother of all the aeons in the Pleroma. Mind-and-Truth, having been emanated from the Father and possessing creative power like His creator, emanated Word-and-Life in imitation of the Father.

Word-and-Life then emanated Man-and-Church. When Mind-and-Truth saw that His creation had also become a creator, He thanked the Father of all and offered Him ten aeons, the perfect number. The writer states that Mind-and-Truth couldn't offer the Father a more perfect number than this. The Father, who is perfect, must be glorified with a perfect number. The number ten is considered perfect because it starts the series of multiplicity in a base-10 system. However, the Father is even more perfect. Being uncreated, He used the first pair, Mind and Truth, to bring forth all the roots of creation.

When Word and Life saw that Mind and Truth had glorified the Father with a perfect number, they also wanted to glorify Mind and Truth. But since Mind and Truth were created and did not have the attribute of being uncreated or perfect parenthood, Word and Life did not use a perfect number. Instead, they glorified Mind and Truth with an imperfect number, offering twelve aeons.

The first created roots of the aeons are: Mind and Truth, Word and Life, Man and Church, with ten aeons from Mind and Truth, and twelve from Word and Life, making a total of twenty-eight. The ten aeons, consisting of five pairs, are named: Depthlike and Commingling, Unageing and Union, Self-productive and Bliss, Immoveable and Blending, Alone-begotten and Happiness. These names reflect the positive and negative aspects of the creative mind's dual nature, both androgynous and self-generating.

Hippolytus notes that some sources derive these ten aeons from Mind and Truth, while others derive them from Word and Life. Some people trace the twelve aeons back to 'Man-and-Church,' while others trace them to 'Word-and-Life.' They name these six pairs as: Comforter-and-Faith, Father-like-and-Hope, Mother-like-and-Love, Everlasting-and-Understanding, Church-like-and-Happiness, and Longed-for-and-Wisdom.

It seems clear that this list has been altered by copyists, but we can still see some similarity to the "fruits of the spirit" listed in Paul's Letter to the Galatians (5:22-23): "love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control." The word translated as "Happiness" is a different form from another "Happiness" in a similar context, although both come from the same root. The difference between these terms is difficult to express in contemporary English.

Also, note the terms for the female aspects of the first and sixth pairs—Faith-Wisdom (Pistis-Sophia). Epiphanius provides an entirely different set of names for the aeons, which are so obscure that they have baffled every philologist and are not necessary for the general reader to know. The Greek terms for the positive aspects of the six pairs likely reflect some characteristics of the higher triad of aeons and prototypes of the Holy Spirit.

Mind-and-Truth, Word-and-Life, Man-and-Church seem to appear as Father-like and Mother-like, Comforter and Longed-for, Everlasting and Church-like; the female aspects of the higher triad are male aspects in the hexad. I believe that the names of the aeons are doctrinal variations or translations of original Zoroastrian terms related to Hormuz and the Amshaspands and other Light-beings, and that the obscure names are remnants of these terms; the ideas and structure of the aeons are clearly influenced by Egyptian thought.

Now, let's continue with Hippolytus. The twelfth and last of the twenty-eight aeons, a female named Wisdom (Sophia), saw the number and power of the creative aeons. She ascended to the depth of the Father and noticed that while all the other aeons created through a pair (syzygy), the Father alone created by Himself. She wanted to imitate the Father and create without her partner, aiming to produce something as great as the Father’s creations. However, she didn't realize that only the uncreated, the absolute cause and foundation of all, has the power to create independently. As Wisdom was created after many others, she couldn't possess the power of the uncreated.

In the uncreated, everything exists together, but in the created, the feminine has the power to emit essence, while the masculine shapes that essence. Therefore, Wisdom could only produce a formless essence. This is the meaning of the words from Moses: "The earth was invisible and unformed." This represents the Good Land, the Celestial Jerusalem, into which God promised to lead the children of Israel, saying, "I will lead you into a good land flowing with milk and honey."

Due to Wisdom’s actions, ignorance and formlessness emerged in the Pleroma, causing fear that the creations of the aeons might also become formless and imperfect, risking the destruction of the aeons themselves. They all started praying to the Father to end Wisdom's sorrow. She was mourning and groaning about the 'abortion' she had created by herself—this is what they called it.

The Father, feeling pity for Wisdom's tears and listening to the prayers of the aeons, ordered an additional emanation. According to the writer, the Father did not emanate it himself; instead, Mind-and-Truth emanated Christ-and-Holy-Spirit to shape and eliminate the abortion and to soothe Wisdom's distress. With Christ-and-Holy-Spirit, there are now thirty aeons.

This illustrates the concept of the dual role of the world-creator and redeemer—Christ, the Logos, by whom all things were made, and the Holy Spirit, the Comforter. Some believe that the thirty aeons are composed this way, while others include Silence with the Father and add the aeons of the Pleroma to them.

Christ-and-Holy-Spirit, emanated by Mind-and-Truth, eliminate Wisdom's formless abortion, which she created on her own without a consort, from the universal aeons. This prevents the perfect aeons from being disturbed by its formlessness.

These passages clarify the term "only-begotten" (monogenes). Traditionally, "only-begotten son" is understood to mean that Christ is the only son of the Father. Apologetic philology also suggests it means "the only one of his kind." In the list of ten aeons mentioned earlier, the male aspect of the last pair is referred to by this name, which I have translated as "alone-begotten."

In the passage above, the term "abortion" of Wisdom is translated as "which she begat of herself." This term usually translated as "only-begotten" actually means "created alone," indicating creation from a single principle rather than from a pair. This meaning is found not only among the Gnostics but also in Orphic and Egyptian traditions. Hippolytus then explains:

> To ensure that the formlessness of the abortion would never again be visible to the perfect aeons, the Father Himself sent forth an additional emanation of a single aeon, the Cross (or stake). This was created as a great being by the great and perfect Father and was meant to be the protector and boundary of the aeons. This Cross forms the Boundary of the Pleroma, holding the thirty aeons together. These thirty aeons make up the divine creation...

The word translated as "cross" in the New Testament generally means a stake. Historically, Jews would expose the bodies of those who were stoned on a stake as a warning to others. The phrase "hanging on the tree" comes from this practice. However, for the Pleroma, these symbols are living rather than dead. The cross thus becomes the concept of a great wall or sphere, binding the living Aeon. This symbolizes the prototype of the mystic Christ bound to or in the body.

The idea was straightforward, though its expression in words was very confusing. Hippolytus explains:

> It is called the Boundary because it separates the incomplete from the perfect; it is called the Partaker because it shares in the incomplete; and it is also called the Cross because it remains fixed and unchangeable, preventing any imperfection from entering the realm of the perfect.

It is challenging to understand the different aspects of this boundary as described by Hippolytus. It is essentially the Great Firmament or Limiting Spirit of Basilides, and the Final Limit in the Pistis Sophia text. This is where the "robe of power" was left when the Saviour came down to regenerate the cosmos outside the perfect realm, and which he wore again after completing his mission, as described at the beginning of the manuscript.

This is the Limit "against which none shall prevail" until the Day Be-with-us, the final day mentioned in the Book of the Dead and the Askew Codex – the day of ultimate initiation or perfection for the few who are worthy to become gods or christs, and for the majority of humanity, the end of the world-cycle when everything dissolves into pralaya, as Indian philosophy calls it.

This "robe of power" is likely the highest spiritual body, which connects divine and human natures, opening the divine world to humans and making them partakers of eternal life. Its symbol is a circle, reflecting the body or self-limitation of the sexless Heavenly Man, the Logos, who limits and sacrifices Himself for the good of humanity.

Lower down in the hierarchy of existence, this becomes the dead symbol of the orthodox cross (+), representing mankind's dual nature. It is important to note that this Limit is established solely by the Father, and through it, He completes and perfects the entire divine world of aeons, making them one entity, the Living Aeon, in relation to any creation outside the Pleroma.

Continuing with Hippolytus' summary:

> Outside this Boundary, Cross, or Partaker, lies what they call the Ogdoad; this represents Wisdom outside the Pleroma. Christ and the Holy Spirit, who were emanated by Mind and Truth, shaped and perfected this Wisdom into a complete aeon so that she would eventually be equal to any within the Pleroma. Once Wisdom outside the Pleroma had been shaped, it was impossible for Christ and the Holy Spirit, having been emanated from Mind and Truth, to remain with her outside the Pleroma. Thus, Christ and the Holy Spirit ascended to Mind and Truth within the Boundary, joining the other aeons in glorifying the Father.
>
> And since there was now a unified sense of peace and harmony among all the aeons within the Pleroma, they decided to glorify the Father not just through their individual pairs but also by making a single offering of suitable fruits to the Father. All thirty aeons agreed to emanate a single aeon, the common fruit of the Pleroma, as a symbol of their unity, harmony, and peace. Since this emanation was a collective gift to the Father, they called it the Common Fruit of the Pleroma. This is how things within the Pleroma were established.
>
> And now, the Common Fruit of the Pleroma had emerged—Jesus, the great High Priest. When Wisdom outside the Pleroma sought after Christ, who had shaped her and the Holy Spirit, she became very frightened, fearing she might perish now that He who had formed and supported her was gone.

This process of shaping Wisdom, or the cosmic substance, involves creating a boundary for the Ogdoad (the etherial space) and then forming the separated substance according to the patterns of the aeons. This is depicted as follows:

> She mourned and was greatly troubled, wondering who had shaped her [the Christ], who the Holy Spirit was, where they had gone, who prevented them from being with her, and who envied her beautiful and blessed vision. In such suffering, she began to pray and plead with Him who had left her. Then, the Christ within the Pleroma and the other aeons took pity on her prayers and sent out from the Pleroma the Common Fruit to be the companion of Wisdom outside and to correct the emotions she experienced while seeking Christ.
>
> And so, the Common Fruit came forth from the Pleroma and found her afflicted by the four primary emotions—fear, grief, doubt, and supplication. He alleviated her suffering, realizing that it was not appropriate for such emotions, being natural to an aeon and specific to Wisdom, to be destroyed. At the same time, Wisdom should not continue to endure such afflictions as fear, grief, supplication, and doubt.
>
> Since he was such a significant being and a child of the entire Pleroma, he transformed her emotions into substantial essences. He turned fear into a psychic essence, grief into a subtle matter, doubt into an elemental essence, and prayer and supplication into a path upward, meaning repentance and the power of the psychic essence called "right." Just as human emotions are considered material, the cosmic soul's emotions are viewed as substantial essences in this universal philosophy.

We have now reached the part of the Wisdom-drama that describes the creation of the "sensible" world, as opposed to the "intelligible" world, using Platonic terms. Before continuing with Hippolytus' summary, a brief explanation is needed to help the student navigate the complex Gnostic terminology. The lower or fallen Wisdom is the primary substance, or World-mother, driven chaotically by four major impulses, her primary "afflictions" or "passions." She is rescued from this chaotic state by a Divine Power from above, which represents the synthesis of the intelligible or noetic universe's powers.

Chaos becomes cosmos; disorder becomes order. The "passions" (fear, grief, doubt, and supplication) are separated from her, purifying her and leaving her above, while the passions condense into denser substances, forming the sensible universe. Above them hovers the Power, representing the three highest planes (the intelligible universe or Pleroma) and the Supreme Deity beyond. This Divine Power is called the Common Fruit.

The four "passions" are separated from Sophia, who remains as the substance of the highest of the lower planes. Fear and grief become the substances of the psychic and physical planes, respectively. Doubt is seen as a negative force, leading to worse states of existence than the physical. In contrast, prayer and repentance are viewed as pathways to Heaven. This aligns with the soul's "right" power, while the soul's downward tendency into matter is called the "left" power.

Returning to our text, the "fabricative power" comes from "fear." The scripture says, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdom," meaning Wisdom's suffering started with fear, which led to grief, doubt, and finally seeking refuge in prayer. The psychic substance is described as fiery and is referred to as Middle Space, Hebdomad, and Ancient of Days. These terms actually refer to the cosmic psychic substance, which is the creative force of the physical world. It is fiery in nature. Moses also states, "The Lord, your God, is a burning and consuming fire."

Fear is said to contract and densify a person's aura. The psychic plane is a denser form of the mental plane, and the material plane is a denser form of the psychic plane. Fire has a dual nature: one type is all-consuming and unquenchable, and another type, presumably, is quenchable.

> The soul, or psychic substance, is partly mortal and partly immortal, acting as a bridge between the sublunary space (Hebdomad) and its end. It is below the Ogdoad (the realm of mind or spirit), where Wisdom, the day of perfect forms (the sun-space), and the Common Fruit of the Pleroma exist, but above the physical matter (the earth-space), of which it is the creator (or demiurgic power).
>
> If the soul is made to resemble the things above, it becomes immortal and enters the Ogdoad, which is said to be the Jerusalem above the heavens. However, if it becomes like matter, that is, the material passions, then it is destructible and perishes.

The next sentence has a significant gap, which I've tried to fill in as follows:

> Therefore, coming from the psychic substance (and not from an aeon or pleroma), the first and greatest power of the Sensible World was an image (and not a pleroma, namely the Workman or Demiurge); while the power coming from the material substance or 'grief' was the Accuser (Diabolus), the ruler of this world. The power that comes from the elemental (or daemonian) substance, which is 'doubt,' is Beelzeboul. Wisdom herself works from above, from the Ogdoad, down to the Hebdomad.
>
> They say the Workman knows nothing at all, is mindless and foolish, and does not really understand what he does. Because of his ignorance, Wisdom energized and strengthened everything he made; and even though she was the one who did this, he thought he had created the universe by himself and began to say, 'I am God, and there is no other beside me.'
>
> Here we have our Tetraktys according to Valentinus, 'a source of ever-flowing nature with roots,' and our Wisdom, from which the whole creation is now made, both psychic and material."

Hippolytus uses this to mock both Pythagoras and Valentinus. The four "passions" are very different from the Tetraktys itself; they are merely its reflection on lower levels.

> Wisdom is called 'Spirit,' and the Creator 'Soul'; whereas the Accuser (Devil) is the 'Ruler of this World' [Body], and Beelzeboul the 'Ruler of Demons' [Chaos]. This is what they teach us.
>
> Additionally, using mathematical principles, as I mentioned earlier, they claim that the aeons within the Pleroma produce a new series of thirty other aeons following the law of similarity, so that the Pleroma can form a perfect number. Just as the Pythagoreans divided into twelve, thirty, and sixty—adding more complexities—the Gnostics similarly subdivide the creations within the Pleroma.
>
> The contents of the Ogdoad are also divided; and Wisdom (who is the mother of all living [the cosmic Eve] according to them) and the Common Fruit of the Pleroma (the Word) have produced others who are the heavenly Angels, Citizens of Jerusalem Above, in the heavens. This Jerusalem is Wisdom-outside, and her bridegroom is the Common Fruit of the Pleroma...

Some critics have preferred a version where Wisdom and the Common Fruit produce "seventy words"; but although this was the number of nations among the Jews, different from the twelve tribes of Israel (hence the "seventy" apostles chosen after the "twelve"), I prefer the reading of the Codex, as I have consistently done.

"The Creator also produced souls, as he is the essence of souls. According to them, the former is Abraham, and the latter are the children of Abraham," which explains the otherwise strange expression "Abraham's bosom."

The Workman made bodies for souls from material and elemental substance. This is what is meant by the saying, "God fashioned man from clay and breathed life into him, making him a living soul." According to them, this soul is the "inner man," called psychic when it resides in a physical body, but considered material, destructible, and imperfect when made of elemental substance.

Hippolytus appears to be summarizing the complex cosmology and interpretations of the Valentinians in a few paragraphs, keeping in mind that his summary comes from an unsympathetic perspective. However, it's important to note that even with this bias, he couldn't entirely erase the original meaning of the Gnostic writer.

According to them, the material man is like a dwelling place for the soul alone, sometimes accompanied by elemental beings or by divine "words" (or angels) sent from the Pleroma and Wisdom. These divine "words" coexist in the body of clay with the soul when the elemental beings are no longer present. This is reflected in the scriptures, specifically Paul's Letter to the Ephesians, which says, "I bow my knees to the God and Father and Lord of our Lord Jesus Christ, that Christ may dwell in your inner man"—referring to the psychic, not the physical man—"so that you may understand the Depth (the Father of all), the Breadth (the Cross, the Boundary, the Pleroma), and the Greatness (the Pleroma of the aeons)."

Therefore, 'the natural man,' says Paul in his first Letter to the Corinthians, 'does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him'; and foolish, says the Gnostic writer, is the power of the Creator. The power (or soul) sent forth by the Creator was foolish and mindless, thinking he was creating the world on his own, unaware that it was Wisdom, the Mother, the Ogdoad, who gave him the energy to form the universe without his knowledge.

All the Prophets and the Law, therefore, spoke from the Creator, who was foolish, according to the writer. For this reason, he writes, the Savior says: 'All who came before me are thieves and robbers'; and the Apostle says: 'The mystery which was unknown to former generations.' None of the Prophets spoke about the things we speak of; they were unknown at that time.

When the formation of the world was complete, the future evolution was to reveal the Sons of God—that is, the Creator—who had been hidden. The psychic man had been hidden with a veil over his heart. When the veil was to be lifted and these mysteries revealed, Jesus was born through Mary, the virgin, according to the saying: 'The Holy Spirit shall come upon you'—the Spirit is Wisdom—'and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you'—the Highest is the Creator—'for that which is born of you shall be called holy.' For he was not born of the Highest alone, like men fashioned after the type of Adam, who owe their origin to the Highest alone, that is, the Creator.

Jesus, the new man, was of the Holy Spirit, representing Wisdom, but also of the Workman, to shape and form his body. The Holy Spirit provided his essence, making him a heavenly word, born through Mary. This means Jesus was the example of a perfected man, beyond the need for rebirth and the cycle of generation. He was a manifestation of one of the Sons of God, who together form the Divine Sonship. These sons are all "words" or logoi.

Such a man's whole nature was considered advanced. His body was made by the power that forms other men's souls; his soul was of the same nature as other men's spirits; and his spirit was a "word," directly from the aeons, partaking in the Pleroma.

There is much debate on this topic, leading to division and disagreement. Their doctrine splits into two teachings: the Anatolic and the Italic. Those from Italy, like Heracleon and Ptolemaeus, say Jesus' body was originally of psychic nature. At his baptism, the Spirit, like a dove, descended upon him—this was the "word" of the Mother from above, Wisdom—united with his psychic body, and raised him from the dead. This is the meaning of the saying: "He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies"—meaning psychic bodies. The clay was cursed, as Moses said, "For earth you are, and to earth you shall return." Those from the East, like Axionicus and Ardesianes (or Bardesanes), say the Saviour's body was spiritual.

The Holy Spirit, which is Wisdom, came upon Mary, along with the power of the Highest, to shape the substance given to Mary. We can leave them to investigate these matters on their own, and anyone else who wishes to do the same.

The writer also mentions that just as imperfections were corrected in the aeons, they were also corrected in the Ogdoad and the Hebdomad. The Workman learned from Wisdom that he was not the only God as he thought, but through Wisdom, he came to know a higher deity. He received basic instruction and the first initiation, learning the great mystery of the Father and the aeons, but he was not given the higher power to become a teacher.

The terms used indicate that the Demiurge was taught, but not given the authority to teach others. He received basic knowledge but not the full revelation. According to the writer, this is the meaning of God's words to Moses: 'I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but I have not revealed my full identity to them.' This means that the mystery of who God is was kept secret, learned from Wisdom.

Since the higher realms were set right, the same order was to be established on earth. For this reason, Jesus the Savior was born through Mary to correct things here. Just as Christ was sent by Mind and Truth to heal the sufferings of Wisdom (referred to as the 'abortion'), the Saviour born through Mary came to heal the sufferings of the soul.

This gives the reader a general idea of the beliefs held by these Gnostics. The summary of the Gnostic writer's ideas may have lost some detail, but even a full account would show it came from a student, not a master like Basilides or Valentinus. To fully understand the Valentinian ideas, one would need to analyze (1) the above account, (2) the Excerpts from Theodotus, and (3) Irenaeus's summary of Ptolemy's followers, and then rework the whole. Hippolytus' summary is enough to give the reader a general outline, and more detail would be unnecessary in these brief sketches.

We will now outline the teachings of the main Gnostic leaders of this period, focusing on those associated with Valentinus. We know nothing about Theodotus and Alexander, and only that Secundus divided the highest Ogdoad within the Pleroma into two Tetrads, Right and Left. We will focus on Marcus, Ptolemaeus, Heracleon, and Bardesanes, providing brief notes based on indirect sources, mainly Patristic writings. Let us now turn to the followers of Valentinus, starting with Marcus and his number-symbolism.

#### Marcus' Number-Symbolism

A significant section in Irenaeus is our primary source for understanding Marcus and his followers. Hippolytus and Epiphanius merely copy Irenaeus, adding only additional condemnations. Information from other sources is minimal. It is well-known that Irenaeus is often unreliable when chronicling Gnostic views, but his account of Marcus and the Marcosians is especially questionable. Some followers of this school were found among the common people of the Rhone valley, which concerned the Presbyter of Lyons. He began his attack by spreading scandalous stories about Marcus, a man he had never met, who had never been closer to Lyons than Asia Minor or possibly Egypt.

Irenaeus claims to describe the initiation ceremonies and secret rites of the Marcosians, painting a graphic picture of deceit and debauchery to his satisfaction. However, the Marcosians emphatically denied these reports. Therefore, we will not dwell on the Presbyter's statements, except to note that he admits his accounts are based on hearsay. It is important to recognize that his descriptions appear to be a distorted caricature of the ceremonies, parts of which are preserved in the Askew Codex and a manuscript of the Codex Brucianus.

Irenaeus then summarizes a Marcosian manuscript that came into his possession. He quotes some passages but mostly provides a summary, leaving us uncertain about the original content of the document. The original document is attributed by Irenaeus to Marcus, whom he addresses as a contemporary throughout the entire section. However, this is likely just a rhetorical device, similar to Hippolytus, who, thirty or forty years later, begins his work by predicting that his exposure of Marcus will make him stop his deceit, even though Marcus had already been dead for some time.

We know little about Marcus, other than that he was an early student of Valentinus or at least associated with the early Valentinian ideas. He is generally placed around the middle of the second century and is said to have taught in Asia Minor. Jerome, writing two hundred years later, claims Marcus was an Egyptian.

To those studying Gnosticism and viewing Gnostic teachers as educated individuals trying to present Christianity as a universal philosophy or divine science rooted in a philosophy of religion, Marcus's attempt to adapt the Hebrew number-letter system to the Greek alphabet is particularly interesting. This system, created by "kabalistic" Rabbis, was used to develop a number-symbolism for the complex concepts of aeon-genesis and the world-process in Gnosis. It is possible that the Hebrews borrowed this method from the Greeks, or both cultures might have taken it from Egypt.

The Gnostics used numerous symbolic methods to communicate ideas about both superphysical existence and what they described as suprarational being. The failure of these attempts to achieve general understanding shouldn't lead us to mock the efforts made. Even today, with all our advanced mathematical formulas, we haven't developed a sufficient system of symbols, but that doesn't mean it's impossible to do so in the future. Marcus tried this enormous task with inadequate resources, which may seem fantastical and useless to us today. However, he did have some traditional justification for his attempt.

The ancient Chaldaean religion was based on astronomy and mathematics, using numbers to explain the creation and evolution of the cosmos. Every letter in their sacred language had a numerical value, allowing words and sentences to be interpreted numerically to explain natural and celestial phenomena. The sacred books of the "Mathematicians" were supposedly written with this purpose in mind. The mathematical key given to initiates of Chaldaean star-lore might unlock the sacred science of nature and humanity as understood by ancient seers.

When the Jewish Rabbis returned from captivity, they likely brought back some knowledge of this number-letter method. They used it to reinterpret their ancient traditions, giving new and spiritual meanings to old cosmogonic and patriarchal stories, influenced by their exposure to Oriental ideas during and after their captivity. This method of interpreting texts using number-letters was greatly developed by the cultured Rabbis among the Jewish diaspora, especially in Egypt and Alexandria, which were key centers for this unique knowledge.

A remnant of this number-system survives today in the tradition of the Kabbalah. However, it should be noted that the Rabbis applied this system to a diverse collection of works from various dates and versions, which were not originally intended to be interpreted this way. They believed that every word and letter of the Law was directly inspired by God and thus contained magical power, but modern Biblical research has largely disproven this belief. Now, their methods are seen mostly as a development of apologetic Rabbinism and are only applicable to parts of the documents that may have been written in Babylon by scribes familiar with the Chaldaic method.

There is little doubt that Valentinus and his followers knew all about Rabbinical exegesis from Alexandria, where Jewish hopes were focused after the destruction of the second temple in A.D. 70. They were also well-versed in Pythagorean number-philosophy, which had similarities to the number-books of the ancient Chaldeans. Therefore, it is not surprising that one of them adapted this ancient method of symbolism to the Greek alphabet, in which the documents of the new faith and the new world-science were now almost exclusively written.

It goes without saying that the Greek alphabet couldn't handle the task. However, it was a good exercise for a student of Gnosis and allowed for a lot of creative thinking. This exercise in correspondences wasn't a way to gain new knowledge, but rather a method to convey knowledge that was already known. Now, let's briefly outline some of Marcus' ideas, as best we can, based on the summary of the Marcosian manuscript by Irenaeus in his critical work. These ideas are interesting because they show connections with the Coptic texts we've frequently mentioned.

The source of the document's inspiration is attributed to the Supernal Four, the highest hierarchy of the Pleroma, which only reveals itself to humans in its "feminine" form because the world can't handle the power and brilliance of its "masculine" greatness. A similar idea exists in India, where the God (Deva) uses his power, the Goddess (Shakti, Devi), to communicate with humans; no mortal can see his true form and live.

The following account is based on the Greek texts of Hippolytus and Epiphanius, who copied from the lost Greek text of Irenaeus, and the often flawed Latin version of Irenaeus' Greek original. The manuscript apparently began with a passage describing the speaking forth of the Word of the Supernal Father.

> When the Father, who is beyond all thought and being, and neither male nor female, first willed that His ineffability should come into being and His invisibility take form, He opened His mouth and uttered a Word, like unto Himself. This Word, appearing before Him, became the means by which He saw what He Himself was—namely Himself appearing in the form of His own invisibility.

Now, this is how the Great Name was spoken. The Father spoke the Word; the first part of His Name had a sound made up of four elements; the second part also had four elements; the third part had ten elements; and the fourth and last part had twelve elements. So, the entire Name consisted of thirty elements and four sounds or groupings.

After saying "the first part of His Name had a sound of four elements," Irenaeus added his own idea, likely based on some numerical interpretation of the Prologue to the fourth Gospel, which he found during his search for heresies. He interrupts the summary with the note, "namely arxe," referring to the "Beginning" of the Prologue. Moreover, each of the thirty elements has its own unique sound, character, letters, shapes, and images. However, no element knows the form of the sound it is part of; it doesn’t even pay attention to the sounds of other elements in its group but only to its own sound. Each element, thinking it is expressing the whole Name, continues sounding until it reaches the last letter of its specific sub-element.

The completion or restoration of all things happens when all these original elements come together to form one letter or note, producing one unified sound. This unity is symbolized by chanting the sacred word "Amen" in unison. These notes of the Primordial Harmony helped shape the Living Aeon, which is beyond the concept of substance and creation. The Lord referred to these forms when speaking of "the angels who continually behold the face of the Father."

The common spoken names for these elements are: aeons, words, roots, seeds, plenitudes (pleromata), and fruits. These "spoken" names are different from the "authentic" names, or mysticae voces, which are often found in the Coptic Codices. Each divine element, along with its sounds, notes, or letters, was part of a phase of the Divine Being, symbolically called the Church.

The term "Church" (Ecclesia) means the "Calling Forth," the Heritage of the Elect, and was a substitute for an "authentic" name revealed only to the initiated members of the school. The Church represented the female aspect of the fourth and last pair, or syzygy, of the Tetrad, or Holy Four, the Lords of the Pleroma.

When the last note of the last sub-element of these divine elements sounded, its echo created a new series. This series caused not only the elements of our world but also those that existed before our world. The last divine note, whose echo resonated downward, was uplifted by its original sound to complete the whole Name; meanwhile, the echo descended and seemed to be cast out of the Pleroma. This original sound or element, from which the last note descended, consisted of thirty letters or elements, each containing more letters or elements. This means that the sub-elements spell out the name or power of the main element, and the power or name of each sub-element is spelled out by additional minor sub-elements, continuing infinitely.

Marcus explained a grand idea to his students using an analogy from the Greek alphabet. For example, take the letter D (delta). When you name it, you actually use five letters: D (delta), E (epsilon), L (lambda), T (tau), and A (alpha). Similarly, the letter E (epsilon) breaks down into E (epsilon), Ps (psi), I (iota), L (lambda), O (omicron), and N (nu); this pattern continues infinitely. This example is quite illustrative.

The Gnostic manuscript then described a method to symbolize the Great Body of the Heavenly Man by assigning the twenty-four Greek letters in pairs to the twelve "limbs." The Heavenly Man's Body symbolized the ideal structure and order of the universe, including its regions, planes, hierarchies, and powers. This symbolic representation was called the schema or configuration of the one element, and also the glyph (or character) of the figure (or diagram) of the Man of Truth. This Man of Truth is presumably the God of Truth mentioned in the Codex Brucianus, which contains diagrams of the different stages of the creative deity's emanation.

In the phrase "glyph of the figure," the word "gramma" can mean a letter of the alphabet, a musical note, or a mathematical figure or diagram. Thus, the character, glyph, or configuration represents the super-spiritual Pleroma. This can be seen (1) as the final letter of the four-letter Great Name, or (2) as the last note of the Divine Harmony sung by the Supernal Logos or Word.

To keep things simple, we have used the word "gramma" in its third sense, which aligns with the art of systematizing the elements and powers of nature, known in India as tantra (meaning "systematizing" or "ordering"). Tantrika is now a dual-natured art, both good and bad, primarily involving the creation of magical diagrams (yantras) to represent the elements and powers the practitioner wishes to use.

I won't discuss Mark's diagram of the Heavenly Man here, as it would take too much space. The Word, the male energy of the middle pair in the trinity (Mind-Truth, Word-Life, Man-Church) and the sum of the six, came from the mouth of Truth. This Word is the Logos or Supreme Reason of everything, the self-creator of the universe, who gives fatherhood to all things. On earth, this Word becomes the name known to all Christians as Christ Jesus.

However, Jesus is just the sound of the name here, not its power. The true power of the name is known only to the "elect" among Christians. It is a six-lettered name, but even this is just a symbol. Among the aeons of the Pleroma, it has different forms and meanings, known only to those who are spiritually connected to the Logos.

The twenty-four letters of the alphabet in the diagram of the Heavenly Man symbolize the emanations of the three powers that make up the Pleroma of the aeonic elements above. There is also a similarity in the nature of the alphabet: nine consonants (soundless letters), eight liquids (semi-sounds), and seven vowels (sounds).

The consonants symbolize the ineffable or silent elements of Mind and Truth. The liquids, which are between silent letters and sounds, represent the elements of Word and Life. These receive emanation from the unmanifested above and return the ascent from the manifested below. The vowels represent the elements of Man and Church, for sound going forth through Man gave form to everything. The echo of His voice shaped them into form.

This recalls the Platonic division of the world of ideas into three realms: (1) noetic (related to intellect), (2) both noetic and noeric (related to intellect and divine reason), and (3) noeric (related to divine reason). Thus, we have the series 9, 8, 7, and if we take 1 from 9 and add it to 7, we get 8, 8, 8—representing Jesus, whose name (iesous) has a numerical value of 888.

In other words, Jesus, who was with the Father (Mind), descended to the Church to restore divine creation to balance. This equalized the three phases of the ideal cosmos, making them a unified power. Thus, the 7 gained the power of the 8, and the three realms became equal in number, namely 3 eights, which total 24. These three realms are each twofold (positive and negative), making 6 in total, and these are again fourfold, totaling 24, reflecting the elements of the Unnameable in pairs, trios, and quartets. Furthermore, if you seek the 6 among the 24 letters of the alphabet, which are just representations of the real elements, you will find it hidden in the double letters X (ks), Ps (ps), Z (ds). Adding this 6 to the 24 gives us a symbol of the 30 aeons of the Pleroma.

Our Gnostics cleverly found these numbers and processes in the beginning of Genesis and other parts of the Old Testament. However, we don't need to delve into their detailed letter-numbering methods. What becomes particularly interesting for the theosophical student is when we see that they viewed the Gospel stories not as historical events but as allegories. Specifically, they saw these stories as symbolic representations of the stages of spiritual initiation.

For example, they believed that the story of the Transfiguration was symbolic of the divine process manifesting in a person seeking spiritual perfection—a certain stage of initiation. To explain this, let's use familiar terms.

After "six days"—meaning at the seventh stage since the disciple started their spiritual journey—they ascended the "mountain," which symbolizes higher states of consciousness. This ascent involved three steps he had already achieved and two additional supports. The three were represented by Peter, James, and John, indicating the powers he had gained over the physical, subtle, and mental planes—akin to the Buddhist stages of srotapanna, sakadagamin, and anagamin. The two additional supports were represented by Moses and Elias, symbolizing the spiritual and divine powers that welcome and support the disciple. Thus, the disciple becomes the sixth, achieving spiritual consciousness while still in the body, known as the arahat stage.

The Marcosians said this "six" had descended and was held in the Hebdomad, the realm of the seven spheres of difference. This "six" was essentially the same as the World-mother, the eighth and encompassing sphere of unity, which lies beyond these seven spheres. The six (the arahat), being of the same essence as the World-mother (Wisdom), inherently contains all elements or powers within himself. This is symbolized in the baptism myth by the descent of the dove. The dove represents the beginning and end (Alpha and Omega) of the diagram, symbolizing the head. In Greek, the word for "dove" is "peristera," and its numerical value adds up to 801.

On the "sixth day," the divine order manifested the "last man," the "man from heaven," for the new birth or regeneration of the "first man" or "man of the earth." The passion began and ended in the sixth hour, when the initiate was nailed to the cross. This signifies the power of creation and regeneration, represented by the number 6, to those initiated into the mysteries, referred to as the "Sons of the Light" or "Sons of the Man," as both meanings are valid in Greek.

Creation or descent is symbolized by the number 2 (dyads), and regeneration or ascent by the number 3 (triads), and 2 multiplied by 3 equals 6. Regarding the creation of the sensible universe, the Logos, as the creator, uses the seven-numbered "greatness" (the septenary hierarchy of the ideal universe, the Pleroma or Mind of the Logos, symbolized by the seven vowels) to manifest the result of His self-reflection.

The creation of our specific universe (or solar system) is seen as a construction based on a pattern in the Divine Mind. The creative builder is like a reflection of the universal Logos, influenced by it but separated from the Pleroma. By the power of the Divine Logos, the demiurge, using his own emanation (a reflection of the Pleroma's Life), gave life to the cosmos of seven powers, mirroring the seven powers above, forming the soul of our visible universe.

The demiurge acts as if this creation were solely his doing, but the seven spheres of the world-soul are actually servants to the will of the Divine Life, the supreme Mother. The first of these seven spheres emits the vowel A, the second E, the third E, the fourth (the middle one) I, the fifth O, the sixth Y, and the seventh (fourth from the middle) U. Together, they harmonize and glorify the one who created them (the system-logos or world-builder). Their glorious sound reaches up to the Forefather of the Pleroma (the Divine Logos), and the echo of their hymn reaches Earth, shaping and generating human souls.

Irenaeus, wrapping up his manuscript, shares with his friend various details of Marcosian ideas he has gathered. He once again considers the eternal structure of the Pleroma and references an earlier quoted piece. Before all universes, there is an original source, even before the primal source, beyond what is inconceivable, indescribable, and unnameable, which I call Noughtness. Alongside this Noughtness exists a power I name Oneness. Noughtness and Oneness, which are essentially one, created, though they didn't really create, the ideal source of everything, which is uncreated and invisible, and which we call Monad (or Nought).

With this Monad exists a power of the same substance, which I call One. These powers—Noughtness, Oneness, Nought, and One—produce the rest of the emanations of the aeons. "Noughtness" is the root of the Monad, the circle containing all numbers—the no-number. This text reflects Basilides' influence, but critics disagree whether it should be attributed to Marcus or Heracleon.

The names of this highest group of four, however, cannot be fully expressed in human language; they are the "holy of holies," known only to the Son, and even He doesn't fully understand them, as complete knowledge is reserved for the Father alone. These names belong to the "sacred language," examples of which are found in the fragments from the Books of the Saviour attached to the Pistis Sophia document and in two treatises of the Codex Brucianus.

The substitutes for these names are: Ineffable (ar’rhetos) and Silence (seige), Father (pater) and Truth (aletheia); the Greek words for which have 7 and 5, and 5 and 7 letters respectively, making 24 elements of the Pleroma. Similarly, the substitutes for the names of the second group of four are: Word (logos) and Life (zue), Man (anthrupos) and Church (ekklesia); the Greek names for which have 5 and 3, and 8 and 8 letters respectively—again totaling 24.

The spoken name of the Savior, Jesus (Iesous), has 6 letters, while His unspeakable name has 24 letters. As mentioned earlier, the name equals 888, which can also be interpreted as 24. Similar patterns are found in the letters of the word Christ. You might think this is just forcing letters into number symbolism, but the Marcosians might defend themselves by pointing to Philo and Alexandrian Judaism. These traditions believed in the divine inspiration of the Hebrew Old Testament and the Greek Septuagint, which they thought was written by God. They might also argue that the Greek names for the aeons are substitutes for other names with these number equivalents and are part of their secret teachings.

The truly scientific aspect of their system is the use of numbers as a natural symbol of ancient evolution. Dismissing this as mere Pythagoreanism overlooks the fact that modern physical science is also based on measurements and numbers.

The One contains within it the three incomprehensible concepts: Nothingness, Oneness, and Zero. Therefore, the One represents the upper tetrad. Since all numbers come from the One, this tetrad is called the All-Mother, or Wisdom Above. From her comes the lower tetrad, the comprehensible numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, known as the Wisdom Below. This should be seen as potentially 8, since the 1 represents the unmanifestable One, which symbolizes the unmanifestable tetrad.

Hence, Wisdom Below is considered to be 8, or the ogdoad. This ogdoad contains the decad because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. The number 10, combined with the number 8, makes 80, and combined with both 8 and itself, makes 800. So, the number 8, or "world-mother," is divided into three parts: 8, 80, and 800, totaling 888. This 888 represents her creative power, or Jesus, the creative Logos from above. The numbers 1 + 2 + 3 equal 6, which aligns with the number 4, the last in the lower group of four.

The world's substance is formed through the number 10, represented by the creative 888 or "Jesus," which is the "formation according to substance." However, there is a higher form of creation by the "Christ," known as the "formation according to knowledge." This higher form is represented by the number 12, derived from various combinations: 6 x 2 = 12; (1 + 2 + 3) x 2 = 12; 10 + 2 = 12; 8 + 4 = 12.

The combination 8 + 4 represents the number 8 with an additional group of four. The 10 + 2 represents the number 10 with the twin powers of the upper and lower groups of four added. The doubling of the creative power, represented by (1 + 2 + 3) x 2 or 6 x 2, shows its ascent into itself.

These eternal patterns and processes are evident in nature and history. For example, before the great Master arrived, the world-soul was ignorant until it was formed and regenerated. Similarly, people were in ignorance and error before Jesus arrived. He took human form as Jesus to connect with humans on earth. Those who recognized Him moved from ignorance to knowledge and from death to life, as His "Name" or Power led them to the Father of Truth.

The All-Father's will was to end ignorance and destroy death, and this ending of ignorance is the knowledge of Christ. A man was chosen by His will, one whose nature was aligned with the power above (the lower group of four), making him a suitable vessel. The lower group of four is known as Word and Life, Man and Church. The powers from these four Holy Ones watch over the birth and shape the physical form of Jesus on earth.

This is clearly shown in the allegorical scripture. "Gabriel" represents the Word (Reason or Logos), the "Holy Spirit" represents Life, the "Power of the Highest" represents Man, and the "Virgin" represents the Church. During the baptism, a dove descended on Jesus, completing his transformation from Jesus (symbolically represented by the number 6) to Christ (symbolically represented by the number 12), symbolizing perfect knowledge and enlightenment.

In Christ resides the seed of those who descend and ascend with Him. The power of Christ that descends is the seed of the Pleroma, containing both the Father and the Son, and the indescribable power of Silence, the Mother, known only through them, along with the rest of the aeons. This power of Silence, Peace, and Comfort is the Holy Spirit. It was this Spirit that spoke through Jesus in the Gospels, proclaiming itself as the Son of Man and revealing the Father, becoming one with Jesus. This Saviour ended death by removing ignorance, and Jesus revealed Him as his Father, the Christ.

Jesus is the name of the man perfected in his lower nature (the initiate), but the name has been given to the Man who was to embody him (the Master). The person who carried this Great One had within him the Man, the Word, the Father, the Ineffable, Silence, Truth, Life, and Church, as the Master is one who is united with these.

After three sections of criticism, Irenaeus resumes discussing Marcosian number-correspondences in chapter sixteen. The passage discussing the flaws of the dodecad and the resulting "passion" of the cosmic and individual souls is so poorly written that I haven't been able to understand it. However, starting from Chapter 17, the aeonic types are explained in relation to the cosmos. The two tetrads are represented by the four elements—fire, water, earth, and air—and their qualities—hot, cold, dry, and moist. The decad is illustrated by the seven spheres and the eighth sphere surrounding them, along with the sun and moon.

This clearly indicates that the "seven spheres" are not the "planets" from astrology or astronomy. Finally, the dodecad is represented by the zodiac circle. The motion of these seven spheres is very fast, while the eighth sphere, or heaven, moves much slower. This slower motion balances or checks the rapid movement of the seven interpenetrating spheres by pressing on their outer edge, causing the entire mass to take about 30 years to pass through one zodiac sign, or one-twelfth of the zodiac belt. This retarding sphere was seen as an image of the Great Boundary surrounding the "Mother of thirty names" or Pleroma.

Additionally, the moon takes 30 days to complete its orbit, and the sun completes its cycle in 12 months. There are also 12 hours in each day, and each hour is divided into 30 parts, corresponding to the 12 zodiac divisions, each having 30 sub-divisions, totaling 360. The Earth is also divided into 12 climatic zones. All these details point to the common origins of ancient Chaldean and Egyptian religions.

The creator of the world, or the spirit of time, wanted to imitate the infinite, eternal, invisible, and timeless nature of Eternity. However, he couldn’t replicate its unchanging and everlasting essence because he himself was a product of a shortfall in this eternal nature. So, he represented Eternity through times, seasons, and numerous years, trying to mimic its infinity with a multitude of moments. As a result, he strayed from the truth and followed a falsehood. Therefore, when time is complete, his creation will end.

Irenaeus then spends the next three chapters (18-20) discussing the Marcosian interpretation of scripture, which isn’t very interesting. However, in chapter 21, the Bishop of Lyons shares some of the formulas used by the Marcosian school, which are more intriguing, even though the Marcosians denied their accuracy. He states the baptismal consecration words are:

> [I baptize you] in the Name of the unknown Father of all things, in Truth, the Mother of all, in Him who descended on Jesus, in the unity, redemption, and communion of [your] powers.

Next, there is what is claimed to be a translation of a Hebrew invocation to Christ. Irenaeus provides the original Hebrew, but it is so poorly rendered that even the best scholars have been unable to decipher it. It reads:

> I invoke you, O Light, who is above every power of the Father, You who are called Light and Spirit and Life; for You have reigned in the body.

The ritual for angelic redemption, a high-level Gnostic initiation where the candidate unites with their higher angel, is described as follows:

> [I invoke] the hidden Name, unknown to any deity or authority, the Name of Truth, which Jesus of Nazareth wore in the garments of Light, [the Name] of Christ, the Living One, through the Holy Spirit, for angelic redemption.

The next part is the formula for restoration or final consecration. Those conducting the rite declare:

> There is no separation between my spirit, my heart, and the Super-celestial Power. May I enjoy your Name, O Saviour of Truth!

Then the candidate responds:

> I am confirmed and redeemed; I redeem my soul from this world and all its influences, in the name of IAO, who redeemed its soul, for redemption in Christ, the Living One.

Then the assistants say:

> Peace to all on whom this Name rests!

There were also prayers for the dead and formulas for the soul passing through the seven gates of the seven purgatorial spheres. Irenaeus provides examples:

> I am the son of the Father, who is beyond all existence [meaning beyond the cycle of rebirth], while I, His son, exist. I came into existence to see my own and other things, yet not entirely foreign, for they belong to Wisdom, my female counterpart, who made them for herself. But I originate from Him who is beyond existence, and I return to where I came from.

They pass through different levels of the purgatorial realms, and the powers of those regions step aside for them. The final "apology" to the powers around the world-maker, or demiurge, goes as follows:

> I am a vessel more precious than the female power [lower Wisdom] who made you. Your mother does not know her origins, but I know myself and where I come from. I call upon the incorruptible Wisdom, who is with the Father. She is the Mother of your mother, a Mother who has no mother or male partner. You were created by a female who does not know her Mother and believes herself to be self-generated. But I seek help from her Mother.

And so, he moves on to his own, freeing himself from his chains, which symbolize the soul or lower nature.

This passage hints at the same ideas elaborated in the Pistis Sophia and Codex Brucianus treatises, including the Master's light-robe, the Living One, invocations, prayers for the dead, baptism, and chrism. These were all part of the Gnostic initiation rituals in Valentinian circles. The higher the initiation degree, the more secretive and profound it became. Irenaeus might have known some lower-grade formulas, but only the chosen disciples of these intellectual and mystical schools could understand the higher grades. The Church Fathers likely never obtained documents related to the higher degrees.

#### Ptolemy

Regarding Ptolemy, one of Valentinus's earliest students, we know nothing about his life. It was mainly through Ptolemy's students that Irenaeus learned about some concepts of developed Gnosticism. Whether Ptolemy was still alive when Irenaeus wrote the first chapters of his Refutation around A.D. 185-195 is unknown.

Of Ptolemy's writings, only two fragments have survived: an interpretation of the grand Proem of the Beginnings, which still exists in the Prologue to the fourth canonical Gospel (Irenaeus, I. viii. 5), and a letter to a woman named Flora, quoted by Epiphanius (Haer., xxxiii.). It's currently unclear whether Ptolemy's teachings significantly differed from those of his teacher, Valentinus. Tertullian's statement (Adv. Valent., 4) that Ptolemy separated the names and numbers of the aeons into entities distinct from the Deity, whereas Valentinus included these as part of the Godhead as sensations, affections, and emotions, is confusing to students of Gnosticism.

We will first examine the Letter to Flora and then the interpretation of the Logos-doctrine Proem. The Letter to Flora presents the Valentinian view on the world's creation, Old Testament theology, and Jewish law. According to Ptolemy, opinions are divided: some believe the Jewish Law came directly from God and the Father (the Logos), while others claim it originated from an opposing power, the destroyer, the god of this world (the Accuser or Diabolos). Both views are misguided.

On one hand, the Law is clearly imperfect, as seen from the crude ideas attributed to God in some documents, which do not align with the nature and judgments of the God of Christ. On the other hand, the world's creation cannot be the work of an unjust power, as the Savior Himself said that a house divided against itself cannot stand. Furthermore, the "Apostle" refuted the "baseless wisdom" of such falsehoods long ago, stating that "all things were made by Him," the Logos, and not by a god of destruction. Ptolemy, like other Valentinians, strongly criticizes false knowledge, just as later the so-called "orthodox" Fathers, led by Irenaeus, criticized all forms of knowledge.

However, during this time, the term "knowledge falsely so called" did not condemn all knowledge, as there was still an "orthodox" Christian knowledge, as shown by Clement of Alexandria and others. Such views are held only by those who are ignorant of the causative law; one group of extremists is unaware of the God of Justice (the creator of the karmic law), while the other is unaware of the All-Father, whom the Saviour was the first to reveal to the Jews. The Gnostics maintained a balanced position between these extremes, the only possible one.

Ptolemy answers Flora's doubts in the spirit of what is now called "Higher Criticism." He presents a position that is immediately clear to the educated Gnostic mind, believed to be based on the words of Jesus, but only rediscovered by modern scholars after centuries of ignorance. The law in the Five Books attributed to Moses does not come from a single source, meaning it is not solely from God. Instead, there are three sources: (1) laws given by Moses under inspiration; (2) laws enacted by Moses himself; (3) laws added by the elders.

This division is supported by the "Words of the Saviour"; for example, regarding divorce, He taught that Moses permitted it only because of the Jews' stubbornness, whereas God's Law from the beginning stated that husband and wife should not be separated. Thus, Moses' law was a practical measure, not the true Law. Additionally, the elders' traditions were also not the true Law.

The inspired law taught that honor was due to father and mother. Jesus challenged the traditional elders' belief that anything given to parents by the child was a gift. Ptolemy quotes this differently from the synoptic texts, stating, "Whatever benefit you receive from me is a gift to God." Thus, there are three distinct sources, only one of which can be considered a revelation.

The first division of the law can be broken down into three parts:

1. A good element (the Ten Commandments), endorsed and completed by Christ's teaching.
2. A bad element, which Jesus rejected, such as the "eye for an eye" law of retaliation.
3. Symbolic rites, like circumcision, the Sabbath, and fasting, which Christ interpreted spiritually rather than literally.

This interpretation is supported by a newly discovered saying of Jesus: "Unless you fast from the world, you will not find the Kingdom of God; and unless you keep a true Sabbath, you will not see the Father..."

Christ taught that offerings to God should not be incense or animal sacrifices, but spiritual thanksgiving, goodwill, and good works to others. Circumcision should be of the heart, not physical. Keeping the Sabbath means resting from evil deeds, and fasting should be from base desires, not physical food.

So, where did Moses get the inspiration to establish such practices?The source of Moses' inspiration came from a realm between the human world and the supreme God. This source, known as the world-soul, is responsible for creating the physical world. Unlike the perfect deity of Christ, this source is neither wholly good nor entirely evil; it is imperfect and acts as an arbitrator. It is conditionally righteous, making it inferior to the perfect righteousness and justice of God. The creator of our world is a generable being, while the creator of the divine creation is ingenerable.

The world-maker is superior to the force of destruction and darkness that opposes good. The substance of these cosmic spaces, created by the ingenerable Father, is incorruptible and self-existent Light, simple and unified. This divine substance differentiates into two aspects: the soul and the body, with the "planetary soul" shaping the "earth." This soul reflects the ideal cosmos, and Moses received his inspiration from one of its powers.

In his letter to Flora, Ptolemy, using his knowledge of the unseen world and the teachings of Christ, applies a critical analysis to the Pentateuch, which modern scholarship has only recently begun to understand. We will now examine Ptolemy's interpretation of the opening passage of the fourth Gospel.

The Beginning is the first principle created by God, where the Father originated everything in potential form. This Beginning is called Mind, Son, and Only-begotten (meaning it was brought forth solely by the Father). The next stage was the emergence of the Logos (Reason or Word) within this first principle, the Beginning or Mind. The Logos contained within itself the entire essence of the Aeons, which it then shaped.

According to the Lexicon of the Alexandrian Hesychius, the term Logos philosophically means "the cause of action." Thus, the opening words refer to the divine entities. "In the Beginning was the Logos, and the Logos was one with God, and the Logos was God. He was in the Beginning one with God." I translate the phrase pros ton Theon as "one with God" rather than the simpler "with God," based on Ptolemy's authority, since the simple English preposition "with" does not fully capture the Greek meaning.

First, a distinction is made between God, the Beginning, and the Logos, and then they are unified or identified. This shows the emanation of the two from the one—of the Son (or Beginning or Mind) and of the Logos from the Father—and then the unification of the two with each other and with the Father. For the Beginning originates in and from the Father; and the Logos originates in and from the Beginning.

Therefore, it is well said, "In the Beginning was the Logos," for He was in the Son (or Mind). "And the Logos was one with God." For the Beginning is one with God, and consequently, the Logos is one with God. What comes from God is God. "All came into being through Him, and without Him nothing had being." This means the Logos was the cause of the divine or aeonic creation.

"But what exists in Him is Life"—the partner or consort of the Logos. The Aeons were created through Him, but Life was within Him. And she who is within Him is closer to Him than those who were created through Him. She is united with Him and produces fruit through Him. "And the Life was the Light of men"—"men" meaning first the higher Man and his spouse, the Church, who were enlightened or brought to light through Life. This pertains to the Pleroma, or divine world.

The next verse, "The Light shines in the Darkness and the Darkness did not understand it," refers to the physical universe. Even though the chaos of the physical universe was made into order by the passion of the Divine Aeon, the physical world did not recognize Him. This Aeon is therefore Truth and Life, and the "Word made flesh" in the cosmic process. Only the enlightened have "seen His glory," the glory of the Only-begotten Son, the Divine Aeon or Pleroma, given to Him by the Father, full of Grace (also called Silence and Peace) and Truth.

Ptolemy explained that the Proem references the two tetrads—Father and Silence, Mind and Truth, Word and Life, Man and Church. This was Ptolemy's interpretation of the Proem of the Logos-doctrine, and we must stop here as there is no more information available. Irenaeus' summary in his opening chapters of what he learned about the beliefs of Ptolemy's followers is very similar to the aeon-process and Sophia-myth drama familiar from Hippolytus' account.

#### Heracleon

Of the life of Heracleon, whom Clement of Alexandria mentioned...Heracleon, considered the "most esteemed of the school of Valentinus," is known only for writing certain Memoirs (hypomnemata), which include a commentary on the fourth Gospel. This commentary, the first on any New Testament book, is usually dated to 170-180 A.D. Heracleon is thus the first commentator on canonical Christianity, and significant fragments of his work have been preserved by Origen in his own commentary on the Gospel of John.

These fragments were first collected by Grabe in his Spicilegium, and later reprinted by Massuet and Stieren in their editions of Irenaeus, and by Hilgenfeld in his Ketzergeschichte (1884). In 1891, they were re-edited by Brooke in Texts and Studies, i. 4, after a new comparison of all eight known manuscripts (only three had been compared before).

In these fragments, Heracleon uses the "Valentinian" system as a basis, but it remains in the background, and his interpretations are often supported by Origen. The Gnostics were still part of the Christian community and wanted to remain so, but were eventually expelled because they claimed that Christ's teachings contained wisdom beyond the understanding of the majority.

Heracleon's commentary, however, is not our main focus, as it lies between Gnostic and General Christian exegesis, similar to the perspectives of Clement and Origen.

#### Bardesanes

Now, let's discuss Bardaisan (a.k.a. Bardesanes), whom Hilgenfeld calls "the last of the Gnostics." This will conclude our overview of the Christian theosophists, which we have tried to piece together from the fragmented records preserved in early Christian literature.

Bardesanes was the last prominent Gnostic who tried to spread his beliefs among mainstream Christians. Although Gnostic ideas continued to be studied secretly for centuries and resurfaced in different forms, such as the Manichaean movement, Bardesanes was notable for his public efforts. Born on July 11, 155 A.D. in Edessa by the river Daisan, he died in 233 A.D. at the age of 78. His parents, Nuhama and Nahashirama, were wealthy and noble, ensuring he received an excellent education. He grew up alongside a prince who later became one of the Abgar kings, gaining fame for his skill in archery.

Bardesanes married and had a son named Harmonius. The exact age at which he converted to Gnostic Christianity is unknown, but he quickly influenced his royal friend and patron, leading the Abgar to adopt it as the state religion. This made Bardesanes indirectly responsible for establishing the first Christian state. In 216 A.D., when Caracalla dethroned Abgar Bar-Manu, Bardesanes defended the Christian faith before the Roman Emperor's representative, earning praise even from Epiphanius, who described him as "almost a confessor." Later, Bardesanes spent some time in Armenia, where he wrote a history based on temple chronicles he found in the fortress of Ani and translated it into Syriac. This work became the foundation for the later history written by Moses of Chorene.

Bardaisan was a notable student of Indian religion and wrote a book on the topic, which was later quoted by the Platonist Porphyry. However, Bardaisan became widely known as a poet and writer on Christian theology and theosophy. He wrote many books in Syriac and Greek, languages he was said to master, though most titles are now lost.

His most famous work was a collection of 150 hymns or psalms modeled after the Psalms of the Second Temple, as preserved in Old Testament documents. He was the first to adapt the Syriac language to metrical forms and set the words to music. These hymns became extremely popular, not only in the Edessene kingdom but also wherever Syriac was spoken. Other known works include titles like "Dialogues against the Marcionites," "The Light and the Darkness," "The Spiritual Nature of Truth," "The Stable and Unstable," and "Concerning Fate..

None of these works have survived except for a Syriac treatise found in the British Museum in 1843 among the Nitrian manuscripts. This manuscript is titled "Book of the Laws of Countries" and is a summary of Bardaisan's views on fate or karma as presented by one of his students. The Syriac text and an English translation were published by Cureton in 1855. This discovery has significantly changed the old view, which was based mostly on the hearsay of the Church Fathers and the polemics of Ephraim.

The latest view, as suggested by Hort, attempts to classify Bardaisan not as a Gnostic but as an orthodox Christian. As more is known about the Gnostics, the same approach will probably be taken in other cases. But since Orthodoxy has condemned Bardesanes for ages, it should at least let him keep the name "Gnostic," which comes from those who taught his master, Valentinus. Before we consider Bardesanes' views on "fate," let's see if we can find anything valuable from indirect sources. Most of what we know comes from Ephraim of Edessa, who wrote about 120 years after Bardesanes. We can judge Ephraim's attitude toward Bardesanes, who had been loved and admired by many, by the harsh words he used. Ephraim called Bardesanes a "garrulous sophist," "double-minded," "secret heretic," "greedy sheep-dog in league with wolves," "faithless servant," and "deceitful singer..

In his fervor, Ephraim mixed up Bardesanites, Marcionites, and Manichaeans, even though Bardesanes opposed the former, and the latter didn't exist when Bardesanes wrote. Ephraim's fifty-six Hymns against Heresies, which he set to the music and meter of Bardesanes' hymns, are a confused attack on Marcion, Bardesanes, Mani, and their followers, without distinguishing their different views. The only clear traces of Bardesanes in Ephraim's work are four excerpts from his hymns, quoted in the last two of Ephraim's hymns.

Here is the text converted into modern English and simplified without altering its original meaning:

The first three fragments from Hort's B translation are:

1. "You, source of joy,

    Whose gate opens wide to the Mother by command;

    Measured and founded by divine beings,

    Sown in union by Father and Mother,

    Made fruitful by their steps."

2. "Let the one who comes after you

    Be a daughter to me,

    A sister to you."

3. "When will we finally

    See your banquet,

    To see the young maiden,

    The daughter you place

    On your knee and caress?"

The first fragment generally refers to the idea of Paradise, usually placed above the third of the seven heavens or among the seven spheres. However, it seems to refer to the Ogdoad or the space above the seven phases of psychic substance, known as the Jerusalem Above by the Valentinians.

The second fragment seems to be an address from the Divine Mother to her elder daughter, representing the higher Wisdom in the Pleroma and the lower Wisdom in the Ogdoad, the spiritual Heaven-world.

The third fragment is likely an address to the Divine Mother, the Holy Spirit, referring to the completion of the world-process when spiritual souls are taken from the Ogdoad into the Pleroma and united with their divine partners at the Great Wedding Feast, in the realm of the Light-maiden, the higher Wisdom.

The remaining fragment consists of two lines:

1. "My God and my Head,

    Have you left me alone?"

This cry was attributed to the lower Wisdom by the Valentinian school, both in the world-drama, when the world-substance calls for the help of her consort, the aeonic world-fashioner, and in the soul-tragedy of the spirit trapped in matter, known as the sorrowing Sophia, as described in the Pistis Sophia text. Nothing certain can be deduced from Ephraim's polemical writings. The only interesting detail from other writers is a beautiful phrase preserved by the Syrian writer Philoxenus of Mabug (around 500 A.D.): "The Ancient of Eternity is a boy," meaning he is always young.

Now, let's turn to Bardaisan's views on "astrology" and "fate," or his concept of karma, and quote a few passages from Cureton's somewhat unclear translation of The Book of the Laws of Countries (in his Spicilegium Syriacum, pp. 11 and following). This dialogue was written by a student of Bardaisan, where Bardaisan is the main speaker, and the students occasionally ask short questions for literary effect. We can be confident that this treatise accurately reflects Bardaisan's views on fate or karma, as well as those of his Gnostic school. The following excerpts from Bardaisan's speeches will also shed light on the astrological ideas in the Pistis Sophia.

> I also know that there are men called Chaldaeans, and others who love this knowledge of the art, as I once did before I encountered the teachings of Valentinus. I have said elsewhere that the human soul is capable of knowing what many do not, and these men meditate on it. All their wrongdoings, good deeds, and everything that happens to them—whether in wealth or poverty, sickness or health, or physical defects—are influenced by those stars called the Seven, which govern them.
>
> Some people believe the opposite—that astrology is a falsehood created by the Chaldeans, or that Fortune doesn't exist and is just an empty term. They argue that everything, big and small, is under human control, and physical defects and faults happen by chance. Others claim that whatever a man does, he does by his own free will, given to him by God, and that the faults and defects he experiences are punishments from God.
>
> In my humble opinion, I think these three viewpoints are partly true and partly false. They are true because people speak based on their observations and experiences, but they also misunderstand because God's wisdom surpasses theirs. God, who created the world and humanity, has established the Governors and given each thing its appropriate power. I believe that God, the Angels, the Powers, the Governors, the Elements, humans, and animals all have some power. However, none of these entities have absolute power; only God does. They have power in some areas and not in others, so that God's goodness can be seen where they have power, and they can recognize their limitations and acknowledge God's sovereignty where they lack power.
>
> Thus, Fortune exists as the Chaldeans say. Free will is not absolute, which is evident in everyday life. Fortune and Nature also play roles, but neither is absolute. As a result, we are governed equally by Nature, differently by Fortune, and individually by our Free will. What we call Fortune is a sequence of events determined by God for the Powers and Elements. This sequence causes changes in minds as they connect with the soul, and changes in souls as they connect with the body. This process of change is what we refer to as Fortune and Nativity. It involves a purification process assisted by God's grace until everything is complete. In the philosophy of Basilides, this is similar to the concept of mutual benefit.
>
> The body is governed by Nature, and the soul experiences and perceives this. Fortune does not control all individual actions of the body; for instance, a man cannot become a father before the age of fifteen, and a woman cannot become a mother before the age of thirteen. Similarly, there are natural laws for aging. Women, as they age, lose the ability to bear children, just as other animals do according to their natural life cycles. Once they reach a certain age, they can no longer reproduce, and Fortune cannot change this natural limitation.
>
> Fortune cannot keep a person alive without food and drink, and even with them, it cannot prevent death. These matters are governed by Nature. When Nature's processes are complete, Fortune steps in and influences events, sometimes helping and sometimes harming Nature. Nature is responsible for the growth and perfection of the body, while sickness and defects come from Fortune.
>
> Nature brings about the union of males and females and the pleasure that comes with it, but Fortune can lead to undesirable and improper relationships driven by lust. Nature results in birth and children, but Fortune can cause children to be born deformed, abandoned, or die young. Nature provides enough for all bodies in moderation, while Fortune can bring about food shortages, bodily afflictions, gluttony, and unnecessary extravagance.
>
> Nature dictates that the old should guide the young, the wise should lead the foolish, the strong should command the weak, and the brave should lead the timid. However, Fortune can reverse these roles, putting boys in charge of the elderly, fools over the wise, the weak over the strong in times of war, and the timid over the brave. Know that whenever Nature is disrupted, it is due to Fortune, because the forces that govern destiny are often in conflict.
>
> Those who are called Right support Nature and enhance its excellence when circumstances favor them. They occupy high positions within their sphere. Conversely, those called Left are evil. When they occupy high places, they oppose Nature, harming humans, animals, plants, fruits, yearly crops, water sources, and everything else under their control.
>
> Because of these divisions among the Powers, some people believe the world is governed without oversight. They don't realize that these divisions and actions stem from the Free-will given by God, allowing actions to be justified or condemned. Just as Fortune can overpower Nature, humans can use Free-will to overcome Fortune, but not in all cases, as Fortune also does not always overpower Nature.
>
> It is necessary for Nature, Fortune, and Free-will to exist until the process is complete, according to the plan of the Creator, who determined the life and perfection of all beings and natures. Bardaisan identifies Free-will, Fate, and Nature as the three main factors of karmic law, all ultimately controlled by God. Each influences the others, and none is absolute. Nature deals with the body, Fate or Fortune with the soul, and Free-will with the spirit. The absolute power lies with God alone.

By a strange twist of fate, one of the hymns by the great poet of Gnosticism has been entirely preserved. It's now widely accepted that the beautiful "Hymn of the Soul," found in the Syriac version of the apocryphal Acts of Judas Thomas and kept in the British Museum, is almost certainly written by Bardaisan. Scholars Noldeke and Macke first highlighted this fact (see Lipsius' Die apokryphen Apostelgeschichten, i. 299, sqq., 1885).

This hymn is a beautiful story of initiation, first translated by Wright in 1871 (Acts of the Apostles, ii. 238-245). Recently, in 1898, Bevan retranslated it, using Wright's version as a foundation. Since Wright’s time, so much research has been done on this "masterpiece of religious poetry," as a Cambridge Reader in Arabic aptly called it, that Bevan’s translation is now considered superior and has replaced Wright’s. The strong likelihood of the poem being written by Bardaisan is based on these points:

1. Bardaisan was accused by the orthodox Father Ephraim of denying the resurrection and viewing the separation of the soul from the body as a blessing.
2. He believed in a divine "Mother" who, with the "Father of Life," gave birth to a being called "the Son of the Living."
3. He believed in several lesser "gods," or eternal beings subordinate to the supreme God.

Remarkably, Professor Bevan notes, all three of these "heresies" are clearly present in the poem. There’s no doubt that the Egyptian clothing the prince wears as a disguise and discards once his mission is complete represents the human body. The clear statement that the 'filthy and unclean clothing' is left in their country has a clear meaning; it would be hard to deny a physical resurrection more strongly in an allegorical work.

Since Bardaisan, like all great Gnostics, believed in reincarnation, the idea of resurrecting the same physical body must have seemed like a gross superstition to him. Such a "proof" of shared belief would hardly occur to someone who understands the doctrine of rebirth. According to the poet, the true clothing of the soul is the ideal form it left behind in heaven and will take up again after death.

As for the Father of Life, the Mother, and the Son of the Living, they are presented here as the Father 'the King of kings,' the Mother 'the Queen of the East,' and the Brother 'the next in rank.' Finally, the 'lesser gods' are shown as 'the kings,' who obey the King of kings. If the student reads this Gnostic poetry while keeping in mind the Parable of the Prodigal Son from the third Synoptic Gospel, they will see the basic similarities between the outer and inner traditions and how the inner expands and explains the outer.

I do not know on what authority this poem has been called the Hymn of the Soul; there is no support for that title in the text, and the Gnostic poet had a more specific theme in mind. He wrote about the completion of the Gnostic journey, the victory at the end of the Path; not vague ideas but a clear goal he was striving for. He wrote about the "wedding garment," the "robe of initiation," described beautifully in the opening pages of the Pistis Sophia.

Thus, in the most recent translation, I present what I will call:

##### The Hymn of the Robe of Glory

When I was a young child living in my kingdom, in my Father's house, enjoying the wealth and splendor provided by my caretakers, my parents equipped me and sent me forth from our home in the East. They gave me a load of treasures from our treasury. It was large but light enough for me to carry alone—gold, silver from Gazzak the Great, rubies from India, and agate from Kushan. They also girded me with an unbreakable belt that could crush iron. They took off the bright robe they had lovingly made for me and my purple toga, which was tailored to my size. They made an agreement with me and inscribed it in my heart so I wouldn't forget:

"If you go down to Egypt and retrieve the one pearl that is in the sea, near the loud-breathing serpent, then you shall wear your bright robe and toga again and, with your Brother, our next in rank, you shall inherit our kingdom."

I left the East and journeyed down, accompanied by two messengers, as the way was dangerous and difficult, especially for someone young like me. I passed through Maishan, the meeting place of Eastern merchants, and reached Babel, entering its walls.

I went down into Egypt, where my companions left me. I went straight to the serpent's dwelling, waiting nearby until he fell asleep so I could take my pearl from him. When I was alone, feeling like a stranger among the people there, I saw one of my own kind—a free-born man from the East—a handsome and well-favored youth.

He came and joined me, and I made him my close friend and business partner. I warned him about the Egyptians and advised him not to associate with the unclean. I dressed like them so they wouldn't mock me for being a foreigner and to avoid provoking the serpent. However, they somehow realized I wasn't from their land and betrayed me. They fed me their food, and I forgot that I was a prince and ended up serving their king.

I also forgot the pearl, the reason my parents had sent me. Under the weight of their influence, I fell into a deep sleep. My parents noticed what was happening and were saddened for me. They issued a proclamation in our kingdom, calling everyone to our gate—king, princes of Parthia, and all the nobles of the East. They devised a plan to rescue me from Egypt and wrote me a letter, signed by every noble:

> From your Father, the King of kings, and your Mother, the Mistress of the East, and from your Brother, our next in rank, to you our son in Egypt, greetings! Wake up and read our letter! Remember that you are a prince! See who you are serving! Remember the pearl you went to Egypt for! Think of your bright robe and your glorious toga, which you will wear when your name is listed among the valiant. You will be king with your Brother in our kingdom.

The letter was sealed by the King to protect it from the wicked ones and the savage demons. It flew like an eagle, the king of all birds. It landed beside me and began to speak. At its voice and the sound of its wings, I woke up. I picked it up, kissed it, broke its seal, and read it. The words were written just as they were in my heart. I remembered that I was a prince, and my free soul longed for its true nature. I remembered the pearl for which I had been sent to Egypt.

I began to charm the terrible, loud-breathing serpent. I put it to sleep, using my Father's name, the name of our next in rank, and my Mother's name, the Queen of the East. I took the pearl and started to return to my Father's house. I stripped off their filthy and unclean clothes and left them in their country. I journeyed straight towards the light of our home, the East.

My letter, my awakener, was there before me on the road. Its voice had awakened me, and its light was guiding me. It shone before me, encouraging me to move faster and drawing me on with love. I continued on, passing by Babel on my left, and reached Maishan, the great haven of the merchants on the seashore.

My bright robe, which I had left behind, and the toga in which it was wrapped, were sent by my parents from the heights of Hyrcania. They sent it through their trustworthy treasurers. I had forgotten its appearance because I had left it in my Father's house when I was a child.

Suddenly, as I faced it, the garment seemed like a mirror of myself. I saw my whole self in it, and it reflected my entire being. We were two distinct individuals, yet we were also one in likeness. Similarly, the treasurers who brought it to me appeared as two, yet they were one in appearance. They bore a royal seal, marking the restoration of my treasure and wealth.

My beautifully embroidered robe, adorned with vibrant colors and precious stones like gold, beryls, rubies, agates, and sardonyxes, was prepared in its heavenly home. Its seams were secured with adamant stones, and it was fully decorated with the image of the King of kings, displaying various hues like sapphire. I saw that it was alive with the movements of knowledge and seemed almost ready to speak. I heard it say something to those who brought it down, communicating its purpose.

I realized that as I matured, my stature grew in accordance with the efforts made for me. The robe, in its royal grandeur, expanded towards me, and those who brought it hastened for me to take it. My love urged me to run and receive it; I reached out, took it, and adorned myself with its beautiful colors. I wrapped myself in my brilliant toga and ascended to the gate of honor and homage.

I bowed my head and paid homage to the Majesty of my Father who had sent it to me. I had obeyed his commands, and he had fulfilled his promises. At the gate of his princes, I joined his nobles, and he welcomed and rejoiced in me. I was with him in his kingdom, and all his servants glorified him with their voices. He promised that I would also accompany him to the gate of the King of kings. With my gift and my pearl, I would appear with him before our King.

Professor Bevan rightly calls this glorious hymn a "masterpiece of religious poetry." It is not only magnificent as poetry but also invaluable as a record of hidden knowledge. What have we lost with the barbaric destruction of the Hymns of Bardaisan?

#### Footnotes

1. Either the Pleroma or Ogdoad, the spiritual realms.
2. A Gnostic technical term.
3. Beth-'Ellaye (Wright). It is likely that all the names of countries and towns, some of which Bevan omitted as too doubtful, are substitutes for states or regions of the higher planes. The identification of some has baffled scholars, and most identifications are unsatisfactory. Bardaisan, or his son Harmonius, or whoever wrote the poem, was probably familiar with the great caravan route from India to Egypt and used this knowledge as a base, but the whole poem is allegorical. (Since writing this note, some excellent interpretive work has been done by German scholars. See Bibliography).
4. A symbol, presumably, for the mind-body or garment.
5. The body, a common term in many Gnostic schools.
6. The Gnosis.
7. Of matter, both gross and subtle.
8. Perhaps the elemental or animal essence in matter.
9. Two of the higher garments of the Self, of which there were three.
10. The higher ego, presumably.
11. Next in rank to the Mother and Father.
12. The powers that compel rebirth, presumably the representatives of the Father and Mother.
13. Sarbug (Wright). These are apparently various planes or states.
14. The serpent likely represents the passions inherent in the elemental essence.
15. Is it possible that a real biographical element is woven into the poem? I tend to believe this. It could even be a lost chapter from the hidden life of Bardaisan himself. Driven by a desire to uncover the secrets of Gnosis, he joins a caravan to Egypt and arrives in Alexandria. There, he meets a friend on the same quest. Bardaisan first has the bad luck to fall into the hands of a self-indulgent and greedy school of magic, temporarily forgetting his true mission. Only after this difficult experience does he find the teachings he sought in the Valentinian school. This is just a theory, but it's neither impossible nor improbable.

Names have power. Compare this to the beautiful "Come unto us" passages in the Song of the Powers of the Pistis Sophia. The descent of the Holy Ghost, or spiritual consciousness, involves the names of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, representing the powers of the immortal principles in humans. During initiation, he left his body behind in a trance and moved "to the right," as all initiates in the Orphic and other Mysteries do.

Consider the saying: "As any of you sees himself in a mirror, so let him see Me, in himself." This refers to the mystery of the syzygy, similar to the story of the infancy in the Pistis Sophia. The robe in the Pistis Sophia contains all "knowledges" (gnosis). The phrase "I am the active in deeds" refers to the "causal" body or vesture, which constitutes the higher ego. The phrase "It poured itself entirely over me" uses a common metaphor found in the Askew Codex.

This seems to be someone different from the subject of the third and fourth lines from the end. Some Evidence of Gnosticism in Non-Canonical Acts

#### Foreword

Just as there were many other versions of the Sayings and Doings of the Lord before and alongside the canonical Gospels, there were also many other narratives claiming to record the actions and words of the Apostles and Disciples of the Lord before and alongside the canonical Acts. Most of these narratives originated in what are now called heretical circles but were later revised by orthodox editors to fit their doctrinal biases and were eagerly adopted by the Catholic Church.

As Lipsius, the leading expert on the subject, states:

> Almost every new editor of such narratives, exercising the freedom that antiquity allowed in handling literary works, would reshape the materials before him, excluding anything that did not fit his theological views—such as dogmatic statements, speeches, prayers, etc.—and replacing them with his own formulations, further expanding or shortening as he saw fit or as his immediate goals dictated.
>
> (Article "Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles" in Smith and Wace's Dictionary, incorporated into his comprehensive work Die apokryphen Apostelgeschichte, 1883, etc.)

The main point of interest for us is that some of these edited and re-edited documents still retain traces of their Gnostic origins. Lipsius has shown that their Gnosticism should not be attributed to third-century Manichaeism, as some have assumed, but to the general Gnosis of the second century. These religious stories were widely circulated in the second century, serving as the primary means of Gnostic public outreach.

The Church Fathers attacked the technical inner teachings of Gnosticism with distortion and ridicule. The Gnostics did not respond, likely due to their oaths of secrecy and the understanding that their profound doctrines could not be settled through common debate. Their inner Gospel teachings were meant for insiders and seemed foolish to everyone else. However, the Acts-romances, which likely reflected real inner experiences, were easier to understand. Although modern critics may find them fantastical, they were entirely believable to early Christians. These stories served as a bridge between the General Church and Gnostic teachings and couldn't be dismissed with ridicule.

Catholic bishops and teachers found another way to counter the influence of Gnostic writings. As Lipsius notes, they adopted the most popular stories from heretical books, removed what they considered false doctrine, and presented the purified versions to the people. Fortunately, this purification wasn't complete, and some traces of the original teachings remain, which we aim to highlight.

This brief overview won't describe these Acts in detail or critically analyze their sources. Our goal is to salvage fragments that still show traces of old Gnostic teachings. While the original works have vanished and the tradition has been heavily edited, the newly discovered Coptic Acts of Peter might offer an untouched translation of the original text.

The earliest collection of these Gnostic Acts is believed to have been compiled by someone named Leucius (there are at least eighteen variations of this name), or Leucius Charinus, who is said to have been a disciple of John. However, this claim is unreliable unless "John" refers to the author of the Fourth Gospel and not one of the original Twelve Apostles. Regardless, the so-called Leucian Acts are considered early works. According to Zahn, this collection was made before the Gnostics were deemed heretical, which means it was likely compiled before 150 A.D.

The Leucian Acts are from the second century, as Clement of Alexandria was familiar with them. They were likely collected in Alexandria. Another early collector of Gnostic Acts was someone named Linus, about whom little is known; he may have lived in Rome. The Abdias collection is too late to be relevant here. For a comprehensive discussion and analysis of all Gnostic fragments and references in the Apocryphal Acts, students should refer to Lipsius' extensive work on the subject.

We will now present the most important of these fragments for the reader to understand their nature. Some of these Acts have not been translated into English; I use the most recent texts from Zahn, Bonnet, and Lipsius.

#### From the Acts of Thomas

We have already shared the most significant fragment from the Acts of Thomas, also known as Judas Thomas, which is the beautiful Hymn of the Soul, likely composed by Bardesanes. Even if the Acts of Thomas had only preserved this grand Gnostic Hymn of the Robe of Glory, their existence would have been justified. Fortunately, there is more to be found in them.

The following is a translation of the beautiful Ode to Sophia.

> The Maiden is the daughter of Light; the King's radiance is stored within her. She looks majestic and delightful, shining with radiant beauty.
>
> Her clothes are like spring flowers, emanating sweet fragrances. The King sits enthroned above her, providing them with immortal food at His table.
>
> Truth crowns her head; Joy plays at her feet. She speaks gracefully, letting forth songs of praise.
>
> Thirty-two singers praise her. Her tongue is like a veil, moved only by those who enter in.
>
> Her neck rises like steps, built by the first world-builder. Her hands symbolize the band of blessed Aeons, pointing towards the City's Gates.
>
> Her bridal chamber shines with light and emits the scent of balsam and sweet herbs, delicious myrrh, and savory plants. It is adorned with myrtle wreaths and sweet flowers. Her bridal couch is decorated with reeds.
>
> Her bridesmen, seven in number, are chosen by her. Seven bridesmaids dance before her.
>
> Twelve attendants serve her, always looking for the Bridegroom to fill them with light.
>
> They will be with Him forever in everlasting joy, joining the Great Ones at the feast and remaining at the banquet worthy of the Eternal.
>
> They will be dressed in royal attire, wearing robes of light, rejoicing and exulting while singing praise to the Father.
>
> They have received His glorious radiance and are filled with light at the sight of their Lord. They have been given immortal food that never diminishes.
>
> They have drunk wine that quenches all thirst and curbs fleshly desires. Thus, they glorify the Father of Truth with the Living Spirit and sing praises to the Mother of Wisdom.

If only we had the original version of this beautiful hymn, because even the flawed and altered version that remains is still beautiful. Could it be that this is another hymn by Bardaisan?

In any case, the hymn reflects on the sacred marriage of Sophia with her Bridegroom, Christ, which we mentioned earlier in our overview of the Basilidian Gnosis. In this marriage, the cosmic Sophia was welcomed back into the Light-world and united with her heavenly spouse. This event was to occur at the Great Consummation, but mystically, it was always happening for those who united with their Higher Selves.

Just as the World-soul was reunited with the World-mind in the consummation of the universe, the soul was made one with the Self within in the perfection of the individual. The Maiden is the daughter of the Pleroma of Light; she reflects the splendor of the Kings, the Lords of the Light-realm. Above her in the Light-realm, the King of Glory, Christos, is enthroned, providing the food of immortality to the Spiritual Souls (Pneumatics) who are worthy to be invited to the Feast. At this high initiation, the entire Pleroma (the thirty-two Aeons) sings songs of rejoicing for the victory. Only these perfected souls can praise God with Wisdom's tongue; they alone can make the delicate substance of such lofty heights resonate with songs of praise.

The following verse is difficult to understand and likely does not preserve the original meaning. The "City" refers to the Pleroma; the bride-chamber is the Pastos, the shrine, the holy place where the initiation occurs—the Jerusalem Above, perhaps identical with the City mentioned in the superior manuscript of the Codex Brucianus.

There, the purified soul is guided by seven pairs or syzygies of powers. Rising aloft, she takes with her the twelve, her servants, who are no longer her rulers as they were in the lower world, where she had been chained in the bonds of desire for so long. The twelve are now her own purified powers, through which the Light of Christ is reflected.

In the phrase "both shall joy in bliss and exultation" from the third verse from the end, "both" refers to the reunited soul with its "Angel"—those Angels who always see the Face of the Father. This hymn reveals this and much more to those who love the Gnosis, and many pages would not exhaust its full meaning.

But we must quickly move on to the remaining fragments in the Acts of Thomas. Here, we present translations of two interesting sacramental prayers or invocations in hymn form. The first goes as follows:

> Come, Holy Name of Christ, Name above all names; come, Power from above; come, Perfect Mercy; come, highest gift! Mother of compassion, come; come, Spouse of Him, the Man; come, Revealer of the hidden mysteries; Mother of the seven mansions, come, who found rest in the eighth! Come, you who are older than the five holy Limbs—Mind, Thought, Reflection, Thinking, Reasoning; commune with those born later! Come, Holy Spirit, purge their hearts and minds!

The second goes like this:

> Come, highest Gift; come, Perfect Mercy; you who know the Chosen's mysteries, descend; you who share in all the noble striver's struggles, come! Come, Silence, Revealer of the great things of all Greatness; come, you who reveal the hidden and make the secret plain! Come, Holy Dove, mother of twin young ones; come, Hidden Mother, revealed only through deeds! Come, you who give joy to all who are united with you; come and commune with us in this thanksgiving (eucharist) which we are making in your name, in this love-feast (agape) to which we have gathered at your call!

These sacramental invocations relate to the same ideas as the formula of the Marcosian Gnosis we have already discussed. The Name is not simply "Christos," but represents the Power of Christ, similar to what Indian theosophy calls shakti or syzygy. The phrase "one more ancient than the five limbs" refers to the Man, the partner of Sophia or the Holy Spirit, also known as Christos. The five limbs likely refer to the Pentad of aeons mentioned in the Gnostic Gospel of Mary, with names similar to those in the "Simonian" system. These are considered among the highest orders in the limbs or members of the Heavenly Man, as detailed in the Bruce and Askew Codices. "Those of later birth" are the beginners awaiting the initiation known as the "seal of perfection."

The "mighty things of the whole Greatness" are the mysteries of the Pleroma. The Holy Dove symbolizes Sophia or the World-soul. According to Bardaisan's Gnosis, she had two daughters named Shame of the Dry and Image of the Water, as described by Ephraim, a critic of the Bardesanists. These names likely represent the productive World-earth and procreative World-water, the creators of the material world, or the earthly and sublunary regions.

Before moving on from the Acts of Thomas, here's a sample story illustrating the religious tales of the time:

The Apostle Judas Thomas, also called the Twin of Jesus, is said to have been assigned India as his mission field. Initially, Thomas is reluctant to go, but Jesus, his master, sells him to an Eastern trader as a skilled carpenter. According to Salmon's "Introduction to the New Testament" (8th ed., 1897, pp. 337-338), when Thomas arrives in India, he is brought before the King.

The King, questioning his skills in masonry and carpentry, asks if Thomas can build him a palace. He agrees that he can, and creates a plan that gets approved. He is then hired to build the palace and is given plenty of money for the project. However, he says he can't start until winter. The King finds this strange but trusts his expertise and agrees. When the King leaves, instead of building, Thomas spends his time preaching the Gospel and uses all the money to help the poor.

After some time, the King asks for an update on the palace. Thomas replies that it's almost finished except for the roof and asks for more money, which the King provides. Thomas then spends this money also on widows and orphans. Eventually, the King returns to the city and discovers that Thomas has only been preaching, giving alms to the poor, and healing the sick. Thomas seemed like a magician, yet he never charged for his cures; he lived on bread, water, and salt, and had only one piece of clothing.

Angry, the King summons Thomas. 'Have you built me a palace?' 'Yes.' 'Let me see it.' 'Oh, you can't see it now, but you will when you leave this world.' Furious at being mocked, the King imprisons Thomas, planning a terrible death for him.

That night, the King's brother dies, and angels take his soul to see the heavenly dwellings. They ask where he would like to stay. When he sees the palace Thomas built, he wants to live there. Upon learning it belongs to his brother, he begs to return to life to buy it. As they prepare his body for burial, he comes back to life. He sends for the King, knowing his love, and pleads with him to sell the palace. When the King learned the truth, he refused to sell the mansion he intended to live in himself. Instead, he promised his brother that Thomas, who was still alive, would build him a better one. The two brothers then received instruction and were baptized.

#### From the Acts of John

In a recent volume of the valuable series Texts and Studies (Apocrypha Anecdota II., by M. R. James, 1897), there is a long fragment of The Acts of John, much of which had never been published before. This fragment was recovered from a fourteenth-century manuscript preserved in Vienna. The original Acts date back to the Leucian collection. Since Clement of Alexandria quoted from them, we can place them in the third quarter of the second century. Therefore, we have an early document of great interest, especially because of its distinctly Gnostic nature. Most of the fragment is a monologue by John, preserving a remarkable tradition of Jesus' occult life. The christology is entirely docetic, making the fragment a valuable addition to our knowledge of Gnostic tradition.

Docetism emerged from legends of certain occult powers attributed to the "perfect man." These legends were integrated into various christological and soteriological theories of the Gnostic philosophers and were also based on a historical fact that has been obscured by numerous historical narrations. After his death, Christ returned and taught his followers within inner communities, contributing to the diverse Gnostic tradition of inner instruction. He returned in the only way he could, in a "psychic" or "spiritual" body. This body could become visible at will and even be felt, but compared to a normal physical body, it was "illusory," hence the term "docetic."

Just as the external tradition of the "Poor Men" gradually elevated Jesus from a prophet to the full glory of the Godhead, the internal tradition extended the original docetic idea throughout the entire soteriological structure created by Gnostic thinkers. The Acts of John reflect these tendencies, with "John" representing one line of the diverse docetic tradition, which originated from an occult fact and marvellous teachings of initiation that later became historicized. John summarizes these teachings by saying, "I firmly held to this one belief, that the Lord arranged everything symbolically and for the benefit of humanity, for their conversion and salvation."

It is easy for any student of the occult to believe that Christ possessed very high spiritual powers. The idea that he could appear to others in a mayavi-rupa, as it is called in India, and change his appearance at will, is credible. However, it is against human nature for such traditions to be passed down without exaggeration or fantastical additions.

Thus, we are told that when James and John were called, James saw Jesus first as a child, while John saw him as a cheerful and handsome man. Later, John saw him as a bald man with a thick, flowing beard, while James described him as a young man with a newly grown beard. Additionally, John noted that his eyes never closed. Interestingly, this aligns with one of the signs of a "god" mentioned in Hindu scriptures. John noticed many changes in Jesus' appearance, sometimes looking like "a small, unattractive man," and other times "reaching to heaven." This makes sense for a disciple in close contact with the powerful "presence" or "glory" of a Master. Even more surprisingly, when John lay on Jesus' chest, he sometimes felt it to be "smooth and tender," and other times "hard, like stones." Additionally, when Jesus prayed and meditated, a light appeared in Him that was indescribable.

The following simple story will make readers smile, but it also provides evidence to students of hidden nature that the legend has a basis in occult facts, similar to many legends in India about the touch of yogins in states of ecstasy. (The quotations are mainly from Dr. James' translation).

> Once again, He led us three up a mountain, saying 'Come to Me.' We went and saw Him praying from a distance. Because He loved me, I quietly approached Him so He wouldn't see, and stood looking at His back. I saw that He wasn't wearing any clothes and appeared not as a man. His feet were whiter than snow, lighting up the ground, and His head reached heaven, which frightened me. I cried out, and He turned into a small figure, pulled my beard, and said, 'John, do not be unbelieving, and do not meddle.' And I said to Him, 'But what have I done, Lord?' And I tell you, my brothers, I suffered great pain for thirty days in the place where he grabbed my beard. Peter and James were angry because I spoke with the Lord, and they signaled me to come to them and leave the Lord alone. So I went, and they both asked me, 'Who was speaking with the Lord on the mountaintop? We heard both of them talking...'
>
> When I considered His great grace, His many-faced unity, and His endless wisdom, I said, 'You can learn that if you ask Him...'
>
> Once, when all of us disciples were sleeping in one house at Gennesaret, I wrapped myself up and watched what He did from under my garment. First, I heard Him say, 'John, go to sleep,' and I pretended to be asleep. Then I saw another one who looked like Him come down, and I heard him say to my Lord, 'Jesus, do those you have chosen still not believe in you?' And my Lord replied, 'You speak rightly, for they are just men.'

In my opinion, this story shows the difference between Jesus and the Christ in Gnostic Christianity. The Christ was the Great Master, and Jesus was the man through whom He taught during His ministry.

Another simple story is that when Jesus and His disciples each received a loaf from a well-off person, Jesus would bless the loaf and divide it among them, and each disciple was satisfied with his portion. Thus, "our loaves were saved whole." This believable incident provides a basis for the legend of the feeding of the five thousand. Such incidents were all that the writer thought wise to share with those who were not initiated; there were many more events too sacred or too unbelievable to be revealed to the general public.

> Now, brothers, I speak these things to encourage your faith in Him; for we must remain silent about His mighty and wonderful works for now, as they are mysteries that perhaps cannot be fully spoken or understood...

Next comes the "Hymn" sung before He was taken by "the lawless Jews." The disciples are described as holding hands to form a circle around Jesus, who stands in the center. For each line He sings, they respond in chorus with the sacred word "Amen." This appears to be an echo of ancient Mysteries, and the ceremony resembles a sacred dance of initiation. The Hymn is currently in a very confused and fragmented state, and most of the instructions have almost entirely disappeared. I have therefore made a few guesses; in some passages, however, the confusion is so great that it is impossible to make any suggestions.

In the following text, C. stands for the candidate, I. for the initiator (the Christ), and A. for the assistants.

C. "I would be saved."

I. "And I would save."

A. "Amen..."

C. "I would be freed."

I. "And I would free."

A. "Amen..."

C. "I would be pierced."

I. "And I would pierce."

A. "Amen..."

C. "I would be born."

I. "And I would bring to birth."

A. "Amen..."

C. "I would eat."

I. "And I would be eaten."

A. "Amen..."

C. "I would hear."

I. "And I would be heard."

A. "Amen..."

"I would be understood, being all understanding (mind)."

A. "Amen..."

C. "I would be washed."

I. "And I would wash."

A. "Amen..."

"(Grace [i.e., the Sophia] dances.).

"I would play music; dance, all of you."

A. "Amen..."

"The Ogdoad plays to our dancing. Amen..."

"The Dodecad dances above us. Amen..."

[The reading of this line is hopeless...]

"He who does not dance does not understand what is happening..."

C. "I would flee."I would like you to stay.

A: Amen.

C: I would like to be dressed in appropriate clothing.

I: And I would like to dress you.

A: Amen.

C: I want to be reconciled.

I: And I will reconcile.

A: Amen...

I have no house, yet I have houses. Amen.

I have no place, yet I have places. Amen.

I have no temple, yet I have temples. Amen...

I: I am a light to you who sees Me.

A: Amen.

I: I am a mirror to you who perceives Me.

A: Amen.

I: I am a door to you who knocks on Me.

A: Amen.

I: I am a path to you, a traveler.

A: Amen...

I: Now respond to my dancing. See yourself in Me who speaks; and when you see what I do, keep silent about My mysteries.

(Dancing) Observe what I do, for this suffering of the Man which I am to endure is yours too. [Here probably followed a mystery-drama of the crucifixion and piercing.] You could never have understood what I suffer by yourself. I am your Word (Logos—Highest Self). I was sent by the Father. When you looked at My suffering, you saw Me as suffering; you did not stand firm but were completely shaken. You have Me for a rest, so rest upon Me. Who am I? You will know when I leave.

What I seem to be now, I am not; but what I truly am, you will see when you come. If you had known how to suffer, you would have had the power not to suffer. Know suffering, and you will have the power not to suffer. What you do not know, I will teach you. I am your God, not that of your betrayer.

C: I would like to be in harmony with holy souls.

I: In Me, know the Word of wisdom.

So go the fragmented pieces of this fascinating inner Gnostic ritual. In the version of The Acts of John from which we are quoting, this so-called Hymn begins and ends with the following doxology, to each line of which the disciples, "going around in a circle," respond with "Amen."

Glory to You, Father.

Amen! Glory to You, Word; glory to You, Grace. Amen! Glory to You, Spirit; glory to You, Holy One; glory to Your glory. Amen! We praise You, Father; we give thanks to You, Light, where no darkness exists. Amen!

---

If we had a description of the actions, as well as the words, during this enlightening ceremony, it could shed much light on the original understanding of Christ's "passion." Nowadays, we are discovering valuable fragments of early Christianity almost every year. It is hopeful that a piece might provide us with more insights. It is clear from the Johannine Acts that the Gnostics understood the "mystery of the cross" and the mystical crucifixion differently from the literal historical account.

When the Lord was hung on the "bush of the cross," He appeared to John, who had fled to the "Mount of Olives." "Our Lord stood in the cave, filling it with light, and said, 'To the crowd below in Jerusalem [the physical world], I am being crucified, pierced with lances and reeds, and given gall and vinegar to drink. Now, I speak to you; listen to My words. I inspired you to ascend this mount so that you might learn what a disciple must learn from a Master, and man from God.'

Having spoken, He showed me a cross of light surrounded by a great multitude, all in one form and likeness. Above the cross was another multitude without a single form. I saw the Lord Himself above the cross, without any shape, but only a voice—a voice unfamiliar to us, but sweet and kind, truly of God, saying to me: 'John, it is necessary for someone to hear these things from Me; for I need someone who will listen.'

This cross of light is sometimes called the Word, sometimes Mind, sometimes Jesus, sometimes Christ, sometimes Door, sometimes Way, sometimes Bread, sometimes Seed, sometimes Resurrection, sometimes Son, sometimes Father, sometimes Spirit, sometimes Life, sometimes Truth, sometimes Faith, sometimes Grace. These names are used for your understanding, but in reality, it represents the boundary of all things, the necessity that fixes what was unsettled, and the harmony of Wisdom. In this harmony, there are Powers, Principalities, Sources, and Daemons on the Right and Left, along with Energies, Threats, Wrath, Accusers, Satan, and below, the Lower Root from which the nature of things in creation has come.

This cross separates and organizes all things through Reason, distinguishing between what comes from creation and what lies below it, and then unifying everything into a whole.

This is not the wooden cross you will see when you descend, nor am I the one on that cross, whom you now only hear but do not see.

Many have mistaken me for what I am not, and they will continue to say things about me that are untrue and unworthy.

Just as the Place of Rest is neither seen nor spoken of, much less can I, the Lord of that Place, be seen or spoken of.

The crowd around the cross represents the lower nature, and those you see on the cross are not yet complete because not all parts of Him who descended have been gathered together. When the higher nature is taken up and those who follow Me, obeying My voice, come to Me, those who do not yet listen to Me will become like you and will no longer be what they currently are, but will rise above the worldly people, just as I am above them now.

As long as you do not call yourself Mine, I am not truly Myself. But if you listen to Me, you will be like Me, and I will be as I was when you are united with Me. You come from Me. Ignore the many outsiders and those who don't understand the mystery; know that I am completely with the Father and the Father is with Me.

> None of the things they say I suffered are true. The suffering I showed you and the others in the dance should be considered a mystery. What you saw, I revealed, but my true nature only I know. Allow me to keep what is mine, and see through Me what is yours. See Me as I truly am, not just what I said, but what you can understand, for you are connected to Me.
>
> You hear that I suffered, yet I did not; that I did not suffer, yet I did; that I was pierced, yet I was not struck; that I was hanged, yet I was not hanged; that blood flowed from Me, yet it did not. In short, the things they say happened to Me did not, and the things they do not say, those I actually experienced. I will explain this to you because I know you will understand.
>
> See in Me the slaying of a Word (Logos), the piercing of a Word, the blood of a Word, the wounding of a Word, the hanging of a Word, the suffering of a Word, the fixing of a Word, the death of a Word. By 'Word,' I mean Man. First, understand the Word, then you will understand the Lord, and finally the Man, and His suffering.

It is clear that we are dealing with the tradition of inner schools regarding the great mystery of initiation called the Cross. The Cross appears to have three limbs: a right, a left, and a lower arm, similar to the Egyptian tau. The candidate's body was likely bound to it, and in a trance, their soul ascended the mountain of initiation, the inner "height." Here, the candidate meets the Master, but can only hear His voice; they cannot yet see Him fully because all their limbs are not yet united. The perfect Osiris has not yet formed within them but will at a higher stage, when they are united with Christ.

These teachings are beautiful echoes from ancient wisdom and shed light on otherwise incomprehensible matters. These inner soul experiences were the life and strength of Gnosis, illuminating the complex systems that were so laboriously articulated.

Hermes Trismegistus refers to this as "sweet, joyous light." Now we can understand the significance of the greeting among such scholars: "The mystery of that which hangs between heaven and earth be with you."

We hear about the concept of the Little and Great Man, or the lower and higher selves, in these initiation circles, and also from The Gospel of Eve, which describes a vision on the Mount. "I stood on a high mountain and saw a mighty Man and a dwarf. I heard a voice like thunder and approached to listen. It said to me: 'I am you, and you are I; wherever you are, I am there. I am scattered in all things; from wherever you wish, you can gather Me, and in gathering Me, you gather Yourself.' The "dwarf" likely represents the "man the size of a thumb in the ether of the heart" from the Upanishads. Though he is currently smaller than small, as spiritual nature develops, he will become greater than great and grow into the stature of the Heavenly Man—the Supreme Self.

Regarding the scattering and collecting of the limbs, a passage from The Gospel of Philip, cited by Epiphanius, provides further insight. It is a defense the soul uses while ascending to Heaven, passing through the middle spaces:

> I have recognized myself and gathered myself from all directions. I have not sown children for the Ruler [the lord of this world], but have torn up his roots; I have gathered my scattered limbs and I know who you are." This is what we can gather from the latest published fragment of these instructive Acts. From the already known texts, there are several other interesting fragments. The following is a prayer of praise spoken by John at a sacred feast before his departure from life, addressed to Christ:
>
> What praise, what offering, what thanksgiving, shall we mention while breaking bread but You alone? We glorify Your Name [i.e., Power] spoken by the Father; we glorify Your Name spoken through the Son; we glorify the Resurrection shown to us through You; we glorify Your Seed, Word, Grace, Faith, Salt, True Pearl, Treasure, Plough, Greatness, Net, and Diadem, called for our sake the Son of Man, Truth, Rest, and Knowledge, Power, Statute, Frankness, Hope, Love, Freedom, and Refuge in You. For You alone are the one Lord, the Root of Deathlessness, and Source of Incorruptibility, Seat of the Ages.
>
> You have been called many things for our sake, so that by invoking these names, we may understand that we can never fully grasp Your greatness. This greatness can only be contemplated by the pure-hearted, for it is reflected in humanity, created in Your image.

The same idea, "Your man," is found in the beautiful treatise of Hermes Trismegistus known as The Secret Sermon on the Mountain: "You are God; Your man thus cries to You through fire, air, earth, water, and spirit, through these Your creations." Indeed, the entire Poimandres collection of Trismegistic literature shares the same origin as Gnosis. The high ideals of the Gnostic life and the lofty aspirations of those striving for a sinless state are clearly shown in the farewell address to his disciples, attributed to John by the Gnostic author of the Acts.

> Brothers and fellow servants, co-heirs and co-partners in the kingdom of the Lord, you know how many powers the Lord has granted you through me—how many wonders, healings, signs, gifts of the Spirit, teachings, guidance, reliefs, services, glories, graces, gifts of faith, and communions—you see many of these with your own eyes, and there are many more that your eyes cannot see, nor your ears hear! Therefore, stand firm in Him, always remembering Him and understanding why the mystery of God's plan for humanity is being fulfilled.
>
> The Lord Himself encourages you through me: 'Brothers, I wish to be free from grief on your behalf, from violence, plots, and punishments.' For He knows the violence that comes from you, He knows the dishonor, the plotting, and the punishment that comes from those who do not obey His commandments."Let us not grieve our Good God, who is compassionate, merciful, holy, pure, and spotless. He is unchangeable, without flaw, and knows no deceit or anger. He is higher and greater than any attribute we can name or imagine, Jesus our God.
>
> May He be pleased with us as citizens of a well-governed state; may He be happy with our pure living; may He find peace in our reverent behavior; may He be free from worry because of our self-control; may He be delighted by our brotherly unity; may He be joyful at our wisdom; may He rejoice in our love for Him.
>
> I say these things to you as I approach the end of my appointed task, which the Lord has brought to a close for me. What more can I say to you? You have the promises of our God; you have the assurance of His goodness; you have His presence, which will never leave you. If you sin no more, He will forgive all that you have done in ignorance. But if, after knowing Him and receiving His mercy, you turn back to sinful ways, your past sins will be held against you, and you will have neither a share nor mercy before Him.

Immediately following this is John's last prayer to Christ on behalf of his brethren:

> Jesus, You who have woven this wreath with Your weaving, who have united these many blossoms into Your sweet, everlasting flower, who have sown these Words, protector of Your own, healer who heals freely, You who always do good and are humble, the only merciful one, the friend of man, the only savior, the righteous one who sees all things and is always present, God, Jesus, Christ, Lord, who shields all those who hope in You with Your gifts and compassion, You who know well all those who wrong us and blaspheme Your holy Name, the only Lord, watch over Your servants and protect them; yes, Lord, do this!

The rest of the prayer also has a strong Gnostic influence, but we've quoted enough to give you an idea of the lofty thoughts that inspired such early communities. Before we leave The Acts of John, however, we must share the most famous story from their collection.

It's surprising that amidst so much beauty, this particular story is the most frequently quoted. Many theology students know nothing else from these instructive documents except "The Story of John and the Bugs." Nevertheless, here it is, as it represents the many legends of the time and adds a touch of humor, which is rare in pious circles. This account is taken from Salmon's summary (Op. supra cit., p. 350).

> Once, John and his companions were traveling for apostolic purposes. On their journey, they stopped at an uninhabited inn. They found only one bare couch, so they laid clothes on it for the Apostle to rest, while the others slept on the floor. However, John was troubled by a large number of bugs. After tossing and turning sleeplessly for half the night, he said loud enough for everyone to hear, "I say unto you, bugs, be considerate; leave this place for the night and rest somewhere far from the servant of God." The disciples laughed, and the Apostle went back to sleep while they talked quietly so as not to disturb him.
>
> In the morning, the first to wake up went to the door and saw a large group of bugs standing there. The others came to see, and eventually, St. John woke up and saw them too. Then, remembering his gratitude to the bugs rather than the comfort of the next traveler, he said: "Oh bugs, since you have been kind and followed my request, return to your place." As soon as he said this and got up from the couch, the bugs quickly rushed from the door to the couch, climbed up the legs, and disappeared into the seams. John then said: "See how these creatures, hearing a man's voice, have obeyed; but we, hearing God's voice, neglect and disobey. For how long?"

#### From the Acts of Andrew

From the Acts of Andrew, the following address to the Cross is of great interest, especially when compared to quotes from the Acts of John and other Gnostic ideas. For the Gnostics, the Cross symbolized cosmic processes, the crucifixion of the soul in matter, and its regeneration. Unfortunately, our information is incomplete. The following address, attributed to Andrew, has been edited by Catholic scribes but clearly originates from Gnostic concepts.

> With joy, I come to you, Cross, the life-giver. I now understand your mystery, for you have been established in the world to stabilize the unstable. Your head stretches up to heaven, symbolizing the heavenly Logos, the head of all things. Your middle parts extend like arms to the right and left, to drive away the envious and hostile power of evil, and to gather together the scattered limbs. Your foot is set in the earth, deep in the ground, to draw up those who lie beneath and are trapped in the lower regions, and to join them with those in heaven.
>
> O Cross, the most skillfully crafted tool of salvation given to humanity by the Almighty; O Cross, the unbeatable symbol of Christ's victory over His enemies; O Cross, the life-giving tree with roots in the earth and fruits stored in heaven; O Cross, most honorable and sweet in both essence and name; O Cross, most revered, bearing the Master, the true vine, like grapes, and also bearing the Thief as your fruit, the fruit of faith through confession; you guide the worthy to God through knowledge and call sinners home through repentance!

#### From the Travels of Peter

To the above can be added the final speech attributed to Peter in the story of his Travels or Circuits (Tours). This is found in the fragment from the Linus collection called The Martyrdom of Peter. According to the legend, Peter insisted on being crucified upside down, and the reasons for this unusual request are given as follows in the flawed Latin translation:

> It was right that only You, O Lord, were stretched on the cross with Your head held high, for You have redeemed the world from sin. I wanted to imitate Your suffering too, but I did not feel worthy to be crucified upright. We, as pure men and sinners, are born from Adam, but You are God of God, Light of true Light, before and after all ages; deemed worthy to become human without the stain of sin, You stood forth as humanity's glorious Savior. You are always upright, always exalted, eternally above!
>
> We, humans by flesh, are sons of the first man (Adam), who buried his being in the earth, whose fall is reflected in human birth. We are brought into the world in such a way that it seems we are poured into the earth, so that what is right becomes left, and what is left becomes right; indicating the change in our state brought by those who are the authors of this life.
>
> This world below often confuses right with left. In this world, Lord, you found us like the Ninevites, and through your holy preaching, you saved those who were about to die.

The "authors of this life" likely refer to the forces that bring a person into existence. The story of Jonah represents the initiate who, after spending three days and nights in the "belly of Sheol" or Hades, preached to Nineveh, symbolizing this world, the earthly Jerusalem.

But for the brethren, there is deeper understanding of the Mystic Cross.

> But you, my brothers, who have the right to hear, listen with your hearts and understand what must now be revealed to you—the hidden mystery of every nature and the secret source of everything created. The first man, whom I represent by my position with my head reversed, symbolizes his birth into destruction; his birth was death and lacked the life force. Out of compassion, the Power Above entered this world through physical substance, to the one who was justly cast down to the earth and hung upon the Cross. Through this most holy calling [the Cross], He restored us and transformed worldly things that remained unchanged by human error into eternal things. He exalted the Right by changing all signs into their true nature, considering as good what was thought bad, and what was considered harmful as most benign.
>
> Therefore, in a mystery, the Lord said: 'If you do not make the Right like the Left, the Left like the Right, Above like Below, Before like Behind, you will not know God's kingdom.' I have demonstrated this in myself, my brothers; this is why your physical eyes see me hanging. It represents the way of the first man.
>
> But you, beloved, hearing these words and transforming your nature and life to perfect them, just as you have turned away from the path of error to the secure state of faith, continue to strive for the peace that calls you from above, living a holy life. For the path you travel is Christ. Therefore, with Jesus Christ, true God, embrace the Cross; He has become the one and only Word for us.
>
> The Spirit also says: 'Christ is the Word and Voice of God.' The Word is symbolized by the straight stem on which I hang. Since the voice is a thing of flesh, unlike God’s nature, the cross-piece of the cross represents human nature, which suffered change in the first man, but with the help of God-and-man, regained its true mind. Right in the center, joining two in one, is the nail of discipline, conversion, and repentance.

The Latin translation is very faulty and often obscures the Greek original, but enough meaning has been preserved to show the general idea. The first quotation is from The Gospel according to the Egyptians; the source of the second is unknown. Compare also the changing of the Right and Left with the conversion of the spheres in the opening pages of the Pistis Sophia treatise.

Many other speeches and phrases that still preserve traces of Gnosis could be cited from the uncanonical Acts, but enough has been written to give the reader an idea of the extensive popular literature from Gnostic circles in the early years, and to show that very different ideas prevailed among those in touch with the inner tradition, compared to the exclusively historical view that eventually dominated.

Whether these ideas shed light on Christ's teachings is something each person must decide for themselves. However, it is clear that these ideas were put forward by people who lived much closer to the time of Christ than we do. These were people who dedicated their entire lives to Christ, striving to purify themselves and to understand and live by the truths of the unseen world and the teachings of the Master.

## The Gnosis According to Its Friends

Sempiterna Lux! Nec divitias nec honores peto; me modo Divinae Lucis radio illumines! (From An Essay of Transmigration in Defence of Pythagoras, London, 1692)

Translation: Eternal Light! I do not ask for riches or honors; just illuminate me with the rays of the Divine Light!

### The Askew and Bruce Codices

We have attempted to recover some fragments from the remnants of Gnosis, which was largely destroyed by its fiercest opponents, the orthodox Church Fathers. Now, we will provide a rough overview of the contents of some Gnostic treatises that have been preserved in Coptic translations by its supporters. We will look at three significant documents: the Askew, Bruce, and Akhmim Codices, with the Akhmim Codex only being discovered in 1896. We will discuss the Akhmim Codex later since little is known about it so far, and focus first on the Askew and Bruce Codices.

The Askew Codex was purchased by the British Museum from the heirs of Dr. Askew at the end of the 18th century, possibly around 1785. The manuscript is written on vellum in Greek uncials, in the Upper Egyptian dialect, and is in book form rather than a scroll. It consists of 346 quarto pages and is mostly in excellent condition, with only a few pages missing.

The Codex is a copy, not an original, and the original was translated from Greek. It mainly contains a treatise named Pistis Sophia due to a heading added later. The treatise itself has no title or conclusion. Although it includes a long section about the passion and redemption of Sophia, other parts could just as easily be named The Questions of Mary, as suggested by Harnack and earlier by Matter. The Codex also includes a short inset and a lengthy appendix called Extracts from the Books of the Saviour. For more details, please refer to the introduction of my translation.

The Bruce Codex was brought to England from Upper Egypt in 1769 by the Scottish traveler Bruce and is now in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. It is written on papyrus in Greek cursive script and the Upper Egyptian dialect, and consists of seventy-eight leaves in book form. The leaves are in terrible condition and many are missing.

A scientific examination reveals that it consists of two distinct manuscripts, containing parts of at least two separate Gnostic works and some fragments. The superior manuscript, made of better material and with finer handwriting, contains a profound treatise but lacks a title as its first and last pages are missing. The other manuscript contains fragments from at least two separate books and includes the title The Book of the Great Logos according to the Mystery. Schmidt considers this to be the general title, encompassing two parts he calls the First and Second Book of Ieou.

The content of these treatises is so complex and extraordinary that it is difficult to give the general reader an adequate understanding of them. The student might get an idea of the task by reading my translation of the Pistis Sophia treatise and the Extracts from the Books of the Saviour. However, even this won't fully convey the complexity of the Codex Brucianus, which unfortunately still lacks an English translation. In 1891, Amelineau published a text and French translation of the Bruce Codex with a brief introduction. However, his text was based on Woide's century-old copy of the Codex, and he didn't realize he was dealing with two separate manuscripts, whose pages were in a hopeless jumble.

In 1892, Dr. Carl Schmidt, with great patience, compared the copies made by Schwartze and Woide with the original at Oxford. He then separated the two manuscripts and organized their pages. He published a critical text with a German translation and a detailed commentary. In my summary of the Codex Brucianus, I will follow Schmidt's translation instead of Amelineau's.

Schmidt is the most qualified expert in the field, and his work deserves the highest praise for his tireless efforts. I have a rough translation of Schmidt's extensive work and have thoroughly studied it. Yet, even with his help, I still feel like a beginner in understanding the Gnosticism in these treatises. While Schmidt clarifies many points, countless problems remain unsolved. Despite his excellent scholarship and extensive research, he is completely stumped by the points that seemed most important to the authors of these Gnostic documents.

In 1896, I published a translation of the *Pistis Sophia* and intended to follow it with a commentary. However, I quickly realized that despite the years I had already dedicated to studying Gnosticism, I needed many more years to feel competent enough to undertake such a task satisfactorily. Therefore, I have postponed this task for the future. In the meantime, these brief sketches offer only a tentative summary to give the general reader some idea of the contents of our Coptic Gnostic texts. My only reason for publishing now is that there is currently no information in English on the contents of the Bruce Codex.

First, we will summarize the contents of the so-called *Pistis Sophia* treatise. Then, we will summarize the *Extracts from the Books of the Saviour*, which are included in and follow this treatise in the Askew Codex. After that, we will provide a summary of the fragments found in the lesser manuscript of the Bruce Codex.

I will take the liberty of rearranging Schmidt's order, placing what he calls *The Second Book of Ieou* before *The First Book of Ieou*, because the subjects of his first group of fragments seem to follow those of his second group, rather than the other way around. It's true that the beginning of his second section starts on the back of a papyrus leaf, the front of which contains the end of the previous section. This only confirms the correct position of two adjacent fragments. It is not entirely certain that the numerous other fragments are always arranged in the correct sequence, although I admit I have not found a more satisfactory arrangement myself. It seems very likely that these fragments are part of the original contents of *The Books of Ieou* mentioned in the *Pistis Sophia*, but it is not certain that we can definitively assign our fragments to Books I and II.

The entire text will be summarized under the general title, *The Book of the Great Logos According to the Mystery*, without further distinction. This includes both the introductory material and the bordered pages that Schmidt adds as an appendix. However, it's important to note that this is a tentative arrangement. We might not know precisely which treatises the fragments from the inferior manuscript of the Bruce Codex should be assigned to. Following this will be the fragments of the untitled treatise from the superior manuscript.

My aim in this arrangement is to organize these Coptic translations in a sequence that guides the reader from lower to higher levels of Gnosis. While I recognize that the Pistis Sophia treatise discusses and explains higher mysteries (the three Spaces of the Inheritance) more than the other texts, it does not reveal them. In *The Book of the Great Logos* and the *Extracts from the Books of the Saviour*, some mysteries are revealed, and the disciples see them face to face. Therefore, I place the summary of the Pistis first, even though it was likely composed last.

### Summary of the Contents of the So-Called Pistis Sophia Treatise

The treatise starts by telling us that Jesus, after rising from the dead, spent eleven years with His disciples, teaching them. However, He had only taught them the mysteries of the inner world up to a certain point, specifically to the outermost realms of the Light-world, and even then, with many omissions because they were not yet capable of understanding everything. The disciples had received such amazing teachings that they believed everything had been revealed to them, thinking that the First Mystery—the Father in the form of a dove—was the ultimate truth. They didn't realize that this First Mystery was just the beginning of many greater mysteries.

In the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month Tybi, during a full moon, the disciples were gathered with Jesus on the Mount of Olives, celebrating what they thought was the complete knowledge. As Jesus sat apart at sunrise, a brilliant light shone over Him, making Him disappear into the radiant glow that stretched from earth to heaven. This light was composed of various rays, and in it, Jesus ascended into heaven, leaving the disciples in fear and confusion as they watched silently. From the third hour of that day until the ninth hour of the next day (thirty hours), Jesus was gone. During this time, the regions shook, and there was great confusion and fear, accompanied by songs of praise from deep within.

At the ninth hour of the next day, they saw Jesus descending in an even more brilliant light, now with three levels of glory. The disciples were terrified, but Jesus, full of compassion, spoke to them, saying, "Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid." At their request, Jesus withdrew His great light and appeared in His familiar form again. The disciples worshipped Him and asked, "Master, where did you go? What mission did you undertake? And why did all these disturbances happen?"

The Master, now speaking as the glorified Christ, tells them to rejoice because He will now reveal everything "from the beginning of the truth to the end," directly and without parables. He has been given the authority by the First Mystery to disclose these secrets to them. That's why He is once again clothed in the robe of light, which He had left with the First Mystery in the highest realms of light. He has received this robe so He can speak to humanity and reveal all mysteries, starting with the Twelve Apostles.

The Twelve Apostles are special because He chose them long before coming into the world. He selected twelve powers from the twelve Saviors of the Light-treasure and sent them as light-sparks into the wombs of their mothers, so they could help save the world. These powers make the Apostles not of this world, as they are part of Him. Similarly, another of His powers was in John the Baptist, who baptized with water for the remission of sins. Additionally, John's soul was the soul of Elijah reborn. Jesus had explained this before when He said, "If you accept it, John the Baptist is Elijah, who was to come," but they did not understand.

Jesus also placed a higher power into Mary, His mother, and another power in place of a soul, which led to His own birth. He had overseen the birth of His disciples to ensure no worldly soul entered them, only higher ones. The Master continued, saying, "Behold, I have put on My robe, and all power has been given to Me by the First Mystery."In a short while, I will explain the mystery of the pleroma and its full completeness. From this moment on, I will hide nothing from you but aim to perfect you completely in every aspect and mystery. These things are the ultimate perfection and the highest form of knowledge, all contained in my being. I will reveal all mysteries from the outermost to the innermost. Listen, and I will tell you everything that has happened to me.

> When the sun rose in the east, a great stream of light descended carrying my garment, the same one I had stored in the twenty-fourth mystery, as I have told you. I found a mystery in my garment, written in these five words that pertain to the height: Zama, Zama, Ozza, Rachama, Ozai. Here is their interpretation:
>
> The mystery beyond the world, through which everything exists: It encompasses all creation and dissolution; it projected all emanations and everything within them. Because of it, all mysteries and their regions exist.

The Master then recites the hymn of praise and welcome sung by the powers during His great investiture day: "Come unto us"—the day of supreme initiation when all His parts come together.

> Come unto us, for we are your fellow members. We are all one with you. We are one and the same, and you are one and the same. This is the First Mystery, which has existed from the beginning in the Ineffable, before it emerged; and its name is all of us. Now, therefore, we all live together for you at the final limit, which is also the last mystery from within. That too is part of us.
>
> Now, we have sent you your garment, which has been yours from the beginning. You left it at the outermost limit, which is also the final mystery from the innermost realms, until the appointed time set by the First Mystery. The time is now fulfilled, so I give it to you.
>
> Come to us, for we are all here, ready to clothe you with the First Mystery and all its glory, as commanded. The First Mystery provided us with two garments to clothe you, in addition to the one we have sent, because you deserve them and existed before us. This is why the First Mystery has sent you the mystery of its glory through us, along with two garments.

The hymn explains that the first garment contains the full glory of all the names and mysteries of all orders of the Ineffable's spaces. The second garment holds the full glory of all the names and powers of the mysteries of the twin spaces of the First Mystery. The third garment contains all the glory of the powers of the emanations of all the spaces below these higher realms, down to the earth.

The hymn continues:

> We have sent you this third garment without anyone knowing, from the First Statute downwards, because its light's glory was hidden within it. The spheres and all their regions from the First Statute downwards did not know it. Hurry and clothe yourself with this garment. Come to us, for until the time set by the Ineffable was fulfilled, we have needed you to clothe you with the remaining two garments, as ordered by the First Mystery. Now, the time is fulfilled.
>
> Come to us quickly so we can clothe you, so you can complete the ministry of the First Mystery, which was assigned to you by the Ineffable. Come quickly so we can clothe you, as commanded by the First Mystery. Soon, very soon, you will come to us and leave the world. Come quickly to receive the full glory, the glory of the First Mystery.
>
> Upon hearing the hymn of the powers, the Master donned the lowest robe of glory and transformed into pure light. He ascended to the lower firmament, causing great confusion among its powers due to his brilliant light. Seeing the mystery of their names or powers inscribed in it, they left their positions, bowed down, and worshipped, saying, "How has the Lord of the pleroma changed us without our knowing!
>
> They all sang a harmonious hymn of praise to the innermost interior.

He then continued his ascent to the First Sphere above the firmament, shining forty-nine times brighter than before. The gates opened, he entered the mansions of the Sphere, and the powers there were transformed, worshipped, and sang hymns of joy as before.

He ascended even higher to the Second Sphere, glowing with a light forty-nine times more intense. The powers there also bowed, worshipped, and sang hymns to the interior. He continued his triumphant flight to the Space of the Twelve Aeons, shining with a radiance forty-nine times further increased. All the orders and rulers of the Aeonic Space were astonished.

The Tyrants, led by Adamas, fought against the light in their ignorance, but their efforts were futile. They ended up fighting each other, collapsing, and becoming like the dead with no breath in them—deprived of the light, much like ignorant humans. He took away a third of their power so they could no longer succeed in their evil actions. This meant that if people called upon them for evil magic, which the fallen Angels had brought from above, they would no longer be able to fulfill such requests. He also altered the Fate-Sphere they ruled. Initially, by the order of the First Statute and First Mystery, Ieou, the Overseer of the Light, had set them all facing the Left to exert their influence. Now, they were changed to face the Left for six months and the Right for six months.

After revealing these mysteries, the Master invited questions and interpretations. Mary Magdalene, depicted as the most spiritual of the disciples, stepped forward. With permission to speak, she interpreted a passage from Isaiah through the lens of the new teachings. The passage began with: "Where, then, O Egypt, where are your diviners and ordainers of the hour?" Among other things, Egypt was said to represent "ineffective matter."

The Master praised her insight and explained that while a third of the power of the Rulers of Fate had been taken, they still retained some power. If the ordainers of the hour encountered the Fate or Sphere turning to the Left, they could predict events. However, if it turned to the Right, they would be unable to prophesy because He had changed all the influences. Those who understand the secrets of the magic of the Thirteenth Aeon will perform them perfectly because the power in that realm remains intact, as commanded by the First Mystery.

In response to Philip's question, it is explained that the transformation of the spheres aids the salvation of souls. Without this change, the number of perfected souls would not reach their goal, meaning those who are meant to inherit the higher realm through the mysteries and dwell in the Light-treasure.

The power of the Rulers is in the material world, which they use to create souls. The Master’s victory has taken away a third of this power and transformed it into a higher substance. When Mary asks further questions, it is explained that this third of their power was always gradually purified and collected back to the higher world by Melchisedec, the Great Receiver of Light. This purification was accelerated by the increasing speed of the spheres' rotations, driven by the influx of Light, symbolizing the quickening of evolution.

The essence of the Rulers is described vividly as "the breath of their mouths, the tears of their eyes, and the sweat of their bodies"—the raw material from which souls are made. As their power was taken from them, their kingdom started to dissolve. To prevent their matter from being made into human souls and purified, the Rulers began to consume their own matter, trying to delay the completion of the number of perfect souls—the pinnacle of evolution. They fought against the great soul of the Master as He moved through them, altering their forms and influences.

From that moment, they lost the ability to purify and consume their matter. I took away a third of their power; I changed their movements, shortened their cycles, and made their paths brighter, causing them to move quickly and become confused. From that moment, they no longer had the power to consume the matter that purified their light. By doing this, He shortened their time and sped up evolution.

"This is why I told you before, 'I have shortened the times for the sake of my chosen ones.'" The "chosen ones" are the perfect number of souls who will receive the mysteries. If the times hadn't been shortened, not a single material soul would have been saved; they would have been destroyed by the fire in the flesh of the rulers.

After these explanations, the Master continues the story of his journey to heaven. All the great powers of the Aeonic Spaces saw what happened to their tyrants, worshipped, and sang hymns to the innermost being. He then moved inward to the veils of the Thirteenth Aeon. Outside this Space, He found Pistis Sophia, sitting alone, mourning because she hadn't been brought into the Thirteenth Aeon, her rightful place.

She was grieving because of the sufferings caused by Arrogant, one of the three Triple Powers. But when she saw the radiant light-garment of the Master, which held the full glory of her mystery, the mystery of the Thirteenth Aeon, she began to sing a song to the light in the height, seen in the veil of the Treasure of Light.

As she sang, the veils of the Thirteenth Aeon opened, and her counterpart and twenty-two fellow emanations within the Aeon—making a total of twenty-four emanations from the Great Invisible Forefather and the other two great Triple Powers of that Space—looked upon the light of His garment.

This is the mystical story of the sufferings of Pistis Sophia. At first, she was in the Thirteenth Aeon with her fellow Aeons. By the command of the First Mystery, she looked up and saw the light of the veil of the Treasure of Light and wanted to ascend to that glorious realm, but she couldn't. She stopped performing the mystery of the Thirteenth Aeon and continually sang hymns to the Light she had seen. Because of this, the rulers in the Twelve Aeons below hated her since she had stopped performing their mystery—the mystery of sexual union—and wanted to ascend above them all.

Arrogant, the disobedient one from the three Triple Powers of the Thirteenth Aeon who refused to share his light to benefit others and wanted to rule the Thirteenth Aeon, led the attack against her. Arrogant represents the conservative power of "matter" in this space. He allied with the Twelve Aeons and fought against Sophia. He sent out a great power from his light and other powers from his matter, reflecting the higher powers and emanations into Chaos. He tricked Sophia into looking down into the lower regions, making her believe that this power was the real Light she was seeking.

In her ignorance, she descended into matter, thinking: "I will go into that region, without my companion, to take the light that the Aeons of Light have produced for me, so that I can reach the Light of lights in the Highest Height." With this thought, she left the Thirteenth Aeon and descended into the Twelve Aeons. They chased her, and she gradually descended to the regions of Chaos, getting close to the light-power that Arrogant had sent below, intending to absorb it.

But all the material influences of Arrogant surrounded her, and Arrogant's light-power tried to consume all the light-powers within Sophia. It expelled her light and swallowed it, and her matter was thrown into Chaos. This light-power of Arrogant is known as Ialdabaoth, a figure the Master has mentioned many times. Sophia was greatly weakened and besieged, crying out to the Light of lights she had trusted in the beginning. Because of this trust, she is called Pistis (Faith) Sophia. She began to sing songs of repentance, hoping to be restored to the Light.

The story of Pistis Sophia spans pages 42-181 of the Coptic translation. Her thirteen repentances and songs of praise are a mystical interpretation of several Psalms from the Second Temple collection and five Odes of Solomon.

To gain knowledge of the Light, the human soul must descend into matter, just as the world-soul did before it. Sophia, desiring the Light, descends towards its reflection from the Thirteenth Aeon, through the Twelve Aeons, into the depths of Chaos, where she risks losing all her innate light. The powers of matter continually deprive her of it.

After reaching the lowest depths of Chaos, she begins her upward journey back to spirit. Reaching a midpoint of balance, still yearning for the Light, she changes her mindset and recites her penitential hymns. Her main enemy is the false light, likely the counterfeit spirit we'll learn about later, which represents desire and is aided by twenty-four material powers—reflections of higher projections that are associated with Sophia. Together, these form a system of forty-nine elements. Sophia first expresses seven acts of repentance.

At the fourth repentance, a turning point in her journey, she prays that the image of the Light doesn't turn away from her, as it's time for "those in the lowest regions" to be acknowledged—"the mystery representing humanity." At the sixth repentance, the Light forgives her mistake of leaving her own realm and falling into Chaos. This might symbolize the initial awareness of the higher self within the lower personality. However, the ultimate command to free her from Chaos hasn't come from the First Mystery yet, possibly indicating the higher stage of enlightenment when true spiritual consciousness is achieved.

So, at the end of her seventh repentance, where she admits she acted out of ignorance and love for the Light, Jesus, her counterpart (without the First Mystery), lifts her to a slightly less restricted area in Chaos, but Sophia doesn't know who helped her. It's only at the ninth stage that the First Mystery partially accepts her repentance and sends Jesus in the form of Light to help her, allowing her to recognize it.

Her next four hymns are sung with awareness to the Light, expressing gratitude and declaring that justice will soon come to her oppressors. Meanwhile, she continues to pray to be fully freed from her "transgression"—the lower desire-nature. After the thirteenth repentance, Jesus, without the First Mystery, sent a brilliant light from Himself to help Sophia rise higher in Chaos until she could be completely freed. It appears there are three levels of purification from the chaotic elements of lower nature.

Next is a description of the light-powers, which should be compared with the three vestures of glory mentioned at the beginning of the Codex.

While Sophia sings hymns of joy, the power becomes a "crown to her head," and her material tendencies start to be purified. The spiritual light-powers she retained during her long struggle merge with the new light that has descended upon her. The First Mystery then sends another great light-power, which joins with the previously emanated light, forming a powerful light-stream. This stream is the First Mystery Himself, now looking outward.

When this is completed, Sophia is fully purified, and her light-powers are replenished with new light, alongside her original light-partner, whom she initially thought she could reach the ultimate Light of lights without, leading to her error. However, the final victory is not yet achieved. As she ascends, she faces stronger enemies that change shapes and are directed by the most subtle powers of the cosmos. Sophia is crowned and completely surrounded by the light-stream, and further supported by Michael and Gabriel, representing the "sun" and "moon." The "wings of the great bird" flutter and the "winged globe" unfolds its wings, ready for flight.

This marks the beginning of the final great battle. The First Mystery, looking outward, directs an attack against the "cruel crafty powers, passions incarnate," causing Sophia to trample the seven-headed basilisk and destroy its essence, ensuring no seed can arise from it again, and defeating the rest of the opposition. Sophia then sings triumphant hymns of praise upon being freed from Chaos.

However, the great Self-willed one and Adamas, the Tyrant, are not yet fully defeated because the command from the First Mystery looking inward has not yet come. Therefore, the First Mystery looking outward seals their regions and those of their rulers "until three times are accomplished," likely until the end of the seven cycles or ages, of which the current one is the fourth. When the perfect number of humans reach perfection, they will enter the interplanetary Nirvana—a state beyond time and space, attainable now by very holy men through the highest degree of spiritual contemplation.

At this point, the Gates of the Treasure of the Great Light will open, and the pilgrim will cross the heights. During the many interpretations of scripture given by the disciples and women disciples, Mary, the Mother of Jesus ("my mother according to matter, you in whom I dwelt"), who is also one of the women disciples, receives permission to speak and shares a unique story from Jesus' infancy, previously unknown.

And Mary answered and said:

> Master, regarding the prophecy Your power made through David, 'Mercy and truth have met together, righteousness and peace have kissed each other; truth has flourished on the earth, and righteousness has looked down from heaven'—this prophecy was about You.
>
> When You were a child, before the Spirit descended upon You, You were in the vineyard with Joseph. The Spirit came down from above, entered my house, and looked like You, but I didn't recognize Him and thought He was You. He asked me, 'Where is Jesus, my Brother, so I can meet Him?' I was confused and thought it was a trick. I tied Him to the bed and went to find you and Joseph in the vineyard, where Joseph was setting up the vine poles.
>
> When I told Joseph about the Spirit, You understood and were happy. You said, 'Where is He, so I can see Him? I am expecting Him here.' Joseph was worried when he heard this.
>
> We went back to the house together, found the Spirit tied to the bed, and saw that He looked like You. The Spirit was freed, embraced You, and kissed You, and You kissed Him. You became one and the same being.

At the end of the story of Sophia, Mary asks: "Master and Savior, what are the twenty-four Invisibles like; what is their nature, and what is their light like?"

Jesus answered Mary:

> There is nothing in this world that can be compared to them, nor any region in this world that is like them. So, how should I describe them, or what can I say about them? There's nothing in this world that I can compare them to, and no single thing that resembles them. Truly, nothing in this world matches the quality of heaven. But, I tell you, each of the Invisibles is nine times greater than Heaven, the Sphere above it, and the Twelve Aeons combined, as I have mentioned before.
>
> Moreover, there's no light in this world brighter than the sun. I tell you, the twenty-four Invisibles shine ten thousand times brighter than the sun in this world, as I have previously stated. However, the true form of the Sun's Light, which exists in the space of the Virgin of Light, is ten thousand times more radiant than the twenty-four.

The Master also promises that when he guides them through the various unseen spaces, he will eventually bring them into the Twin Spaces of the First Mystery, all the way to the supreme Space of the Ineffable. There, they will see everything as it truly is, without any comparison. When they reach the region of the rulers of the Fate-Sphere, they will see its immense glory. Compared to that, this world will seem like the darkest darkness, and the entire human world will appear as insignificant as a speck of dust due to the vast distance and the superior quality of the Fate-Sphere.

In ever-increasing glory, each higher realm surpasses the previous, making the lower realms seem like mere specks of dust. As souls progress through the Twelve Aeons, the Thirteenth Aeon, the Midst, the Right of the cosmic cross, the Light-world, and finally the Inheritance of Light, Mary asks the Master: "Will the people of this world who have received the mysteries of light be higher in Your Kingdom than the emanations of the Treasure of Light?"

The Master explains the order, nature, and functions of these great emanations, stating that at the end of the aeon and the ascension of the pleroma, they will all have a higher place in His Kingdom. However, this time has not yet come. Above all, the souls of those who have received the mysteries of light will take precedence.

Mary responds:

> Master, I understand every word you speak. Regarding your statement that all souls who receive the mysteries of light will have precedence in the Inheritance of Light over all the Rulers who repent and all those in the region of the Right, and the entire space of the Treasure of Light, you previously told us, 'The first shall be last and the last shall be first.' This means that humanity, the 'last,' will be first in the Light-kingdom, while those currently in the highest space are the 'first.'

The Master continues his conversation, describing the glorious beings and spaces he will discuss in detail in his future teachings, up to the inner Space of the First Mystery. However, he says he won't discuss those within these highest spaces in physical terms because "it is impossible to describe them in this world"; there is "no quality or light that resembles them, not in this world nor in the realms of Righteousness."

He then speaks in exalted terms about the greatness of the five Great Supporters of the outer Space of the First Mystery, above which lies the inner Space of the First Mystery, and above all, the Space of the Ineffable.

> Those who have received the light-mysteries will enter these supernal realms of the Inheritance, each occupying a space according to the mystery they have received. They will have access to all regions of the Inheritance below their level but cannot ascend higher.
>
> However, those who have received the complete mystery of the First Mystery of the Ineffable, consisting of the twelve mysteries one after another, will have the power to explore all the orders of the Inheritance of Light. They will be able to move from the outer to the inner, from the inner to the outer, from above to below, and from below to above, exploring all dimensions. They will have the freedom to choose and remain in any region within the Inheritance of the Light-kingdom. Truly, I tell you, this man shall be King over all the orders of the Inheritance of Light at the end of the world; and the one who receives the Mystery of the Ineffable is Myself.

Following this is a grand description of the perfect knowledge of such a person: "That Mystery understands why there is darkness and why there is light."

The passage continues, describing the wisdom of the supreme Mystery, which comprehends the reason for the existence of everything: the darkness within darkness and the light within light; chaos and the treasure of light; judgment and the inheritance of light; punishment for sinners and rest for the righteous; sin and baptisms; the fire of punishment and seals of light; blasphemies and hymns to the light; and many other pairs of opposites, concluding with death and life.

However, the Master is not finished describing the greatness of the supreme knowledge. He continues: "Listen further, My disciples, as I explain the complete knowledge of the Mystery of the Ineffable." This knowledge encompasses both cruelty and compassion; destruction and everlasting growth; animals and crawling creatures, metals, seas, and earth, clouds and rain, moving from man to nature and up through all the higher realms.

The disciples are overwhelmed by the magnificence of this knowledge and lose heart. Mary asks: "Master, if this Mystery contains the knowledge of all these things, who in this world will be able to understand it and all its aspects, along with everything you have said about it?.

The Master reassures them:

> Do not be troubled, My disciples, about the Mystery of the Ineffable, thinking that you will not understand it. Truly, I tell you, that the Mystery belongs to you and anyone who listens to you, who renounces the entire world and its material things, who rejects all evil thoughts, and who lets go of all worldly concerns.
>
> Now, I will tell you: Whoever gives up the entire world and everything in it, and submits to the Divine, will find that Mystery much easier to grasp than all the other mysteries of the Kingdom of Light. It is simpler to understand and clearer than all the others. Those who understand this Mystery have let go of all worldly matters and concerns.
>
> This is why I have said before: 'Come to Me, all you who are burdened with cares and labor under their weight, and I will give you rest, for My burden is light and My yoke easy.' Do not be overwhelmed by the complexity of the universe and its processes, for the essence of the universe is its knowledge. Let Christ be born in your hearts by renouncing worldly pleasures, and you will grow into the fullness of the universe and possess all its knowledge.

The Master then continues to describe the knowledge of the Mystery of the Ineffable, picking up where He left off, leading them higher and higher through various levels of existence, up to the Mystery itself, the First Mystery who knows why He came forth from the Last Limb of the Ineffable. He recites all this simply, naming the great spaces and their inhabitants, and promises to explain it in greater detail in His future teachings.

> Now, it is the Mystery of the Ineffable that knows why all I have spoken of has come into existence; truly, all this exists because of Him. He is the Mystery within everything; He is the source, the return, and the support of all things. This Mystery of the Ineffable is present in everything I have mentioned and will mention when discussing the emanation of the pleroma. He is the singular Mystery of the Ineffable. The knowledge of what I have told you, what I have yet to tell you, and everything I will discuss about the full emanation of the pleroma, and the complete understanding of each element and their existence—all this is the One Word (Logos) of the Ineffable.
>
> The Mystery of the Ineffable is the One and Only Word, but there is another Word on the Tongue of the Ineffable. It is the key to understanding all the words I have spoken to you. It is then explained that whoever receives this One and Only Word, when they leave the physical body, becomes a great stream of light and ascends to the heights. They need no apology or symbol for all powers bow before the light they are clothed in, singing hymns of praise, and they rise through all realms of Light until they become one with the Limbs of the Ineffable.

> Amen, I tell you, they will be in all regions for the time it takes an arrow to fly...

This is followed by a description of the greatness of such a soul. It begins with, "Though he is a man in the world, he is higher than all angels and surpasses them all," and it lists all the levels of higher beings, ending with:

> Though he is a man in the world, he is higher than the entire region of the Treasure and will be exalted above it all. Though he is a man in the world, he will be King with Me in My Kingdom. He is an ordinary man in the world, but a King in the Light. Even though he lives in the world, he is not of the world. Truly, I tell you, that man is Myself, and I am that man. At the final culmination, all such men shall be co-rulers with Me; they shall sit on My right and left in My Kingdom. Truly, I tell you, these men are Myself, and I am these men.

Following this, there is an apparent addition, quoting from an unknown Gospel:

> This is why I previously told you, 'In the place where I shall be, there also will be my twelve ministers, but Mary Magdalene and John the virgin will be higher than all the disciples.' And all who receive the Mystery in that Ineffable realm will be on My left and right, and I am them, and they are Myself. They shall be equal to you in all things, but your thrones will be more excellent than theirs, and My throne will be greater than yours and all who have found the Word of that Ineffable.

Mary then thinks this must be the ultimate truth and knowledge, and protests: "Master, surely there is no other Mystery of that Ineffable, nor any other complete knowledge?"

The Saviour replies: "Yes, truly; there is another Mystery of the Ineffable and another complete knowledge." In fact, there are many Words He could have added.

Then Mary asks if those who do not receive the Mystery of the Ineffable before they die will enter the Light-kingdom. The Master responds that anyone who receives any mystery of light will find rest in the Light-world appropriate to their mystery after death, but no one who has not become a Christ will know the complete knowledge of the whole pleroma, for "in full openness, I am the complete knowledge of the whole pleroma. If someone receives the first mystery of the First Mystery, they will become the ruler of the spaces of the First Saviour in the Light-realm, continuing up to the twelfth space."

Mary asks, "Master, why does the First Mystery have twelve mysteries, while the Ineffable has only one?" The answer is that they are actually one Mystery, divided into twelve parts, and also into five and three parts, yet still remaining one. These divisions represent different aspects of the same Mystery.

The two higher mysteries of the three not only ensure that their possessor receives their rightful place in the Inheritance after death, but also grant benefits concerning others. If a person "performs them correctly, meaning they have created those mysteries for themselves," they gain the power to protect someone who does not follow the Words of Truth after their death, so that they won't be punished.

However, such a person cannot "enter the Light until they have fully embraced the light of those mysteries, meaning they must completely renounce the world." But they will be reborn into "a righteous body, which will find the God of Truth and the higher mysteries."

Regarding the greatest mystery of all:

> Whoever receives the Mystery that encompasses the entire Space of the Ineffable, along with all the other sweet mysteries within the Limbs of the Ineffable, which I have not yet discussed with you—neither their origin, nor their structure, nor the nature of each—I have not explained why it is called the Ineffable, why it is extended with all Its Limbs, how many Limbs there are, or its regulations. I will not explain this now, but only when I discuss the emanation of the entire pleroma.
>
> Then, I will detail everything, one by one, for it has emanated with Its own Word, just as it is, along with all its Limbs, which are part of the regulation of the One, the changeless God of Truth. In the region where each person receives the mystery in the Space of the Ineffable, they will inherit up to the region they have received, within the whole Space of the Ineffable. They will not need to provide explanations, apologies, or symbols, for such souls are without symbol and have no receivers.

Similarly, for the second Space below this, the Space of the First Mystery looking inward, such souls need no apology. But for the third Space, the Space of the First Mystery looking outward, each region has its own receiver, explanations, apologies, and symbols, which the Master will explain in due course.

> But when the pleroma is completed—that is, when the number of perfect souls is reached and the Mystery is fulfilled that defines the pleroma—I will reign for a thousand years, according to the years of Light, over all the emanations of the Light and the entire number of perfect souls who have received all the mysteries. Now, "a day in the Light's realm is like a thousand years on Earth, so thirty-six thousand and five hundred years on Earth make up a single year in the Light.

The splendor of the Light-kingdom, with its three Realms and Kings, is described next. "The mysteries of these three Inheritances of Light are numerous. You will find them in the two great Books of Ieou." He will reveal the higher mysteries to them; "but for the lower mysteries, you don't need them, but you can find them in the two Books of Ieou, which Enoch wrote when I spoke with him from the Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life in Adam's Paradise..."

Upon hearing this, Andrew is greatly astonished and cannot believe that ordinary people like them could have such a high destiny and reach such heights. "This is hard for me to understand," he says.

When Andrew spoke these words, the spirit of the Savior was moved, and He cried out:

> How long must I bear with you, how long must I endure you? Do you still not know and understand? Don't you realize that you are all Angels, Archangels, Gods, and Lords, all Rulers, all the great Invisibles, all those of the Midst, those of every region on the Right, all the Great Ones of the Light's emanations with all their glory; that you are all, in essence, from one mass, one matter, and one substance; you are all from the same mixture...
>
> The great Light-emanations have not actually undergone sufferings, changes of region, nor have they torn themselves apart, nor poured themselves into different bodies, nor have they been in any affliction.
>
> You are the purifications of the Treasure, the purifications of those on the Right, and the purifications of all the invisible beings and rulers. In short, you are the purification of everything. You have endured great hardships and tribulations, being poured into different bodies in this world. Despite these sufferings, you have fought and struggled, renouncing the entire world and all its material things. You did not give up until you found all the mysteries of the Kingdom of Light, which purified and transformed you into pure light.
>
> Amen, I tell you, humanity is made of matter. I have torn myself apart to bring them the mysteries of light, to purify them, for they are the purifications of all matter.
>
> The Light-emanations do not need any mystery, for they are pure, but humanity needs purification, for all people are made of matter.
>
> Therefore, preach to all humanity, telling them, 'Seek without ceasing, day and night, until you find the purifying mysteries.' Tell them, 'Renounce the entire world and all its material things,' for those who buy and sell in this world, who eat and drink, who live in their own concerns and associations, continue to accumulate material impurities. The whole world and all its associations are highly material and will judge everyone according to their purity.

This is followed by a long instruction on how the disciples should preach to the world after the Master has ascended to the Light.

> ...Tell them, "Give up everything in the world—its worries, its sins, and all its attachments—so you can be worthy of the mysteries of light and be saved from the torments of judgment." They should renounce mourning, superstition, spells, slander, false testimony, boasting, pride, gluttony, excessive talking, inappropriate touches, greed, love of the world, theft, evil words, wickedness, lack of compassion, anger, insults, robbery, slandering, quarrelling, ignorance, villainy, laziness, adultery, murder, hard-heartedness, impiety, atheism, magic potions, blasphemy, false teachings—so they can escape the torments of fire and ice and the other horrors of an elaborate hell. The worst torments are saved for the greatest sins, where unrepentant souls "shall be without existence until the end" of the age, frozen in that state.
>
> That's the negative side, the things to give up; now for the positive, the things to do. Tell the people of the world, "Be diligent, so you can receive the mysteries of light and enter the Kingdom of Light." They should be gentle, peacemakers, merciful, compassionate, help the poor, sick, and afflicted, love God, be righteous, and live a life of complete self-renunciation. "These are the markers of the path for those worthy of the mysteries of light."
>
> Only those who meet these conditions and repent will receive the mysteries. "I brought these mysteries into the world for the forgiveness of all the sins people have committed from the beginning. That is why I said before, 'I came not to call the righteous.'

The question now arises: What happens to good people who have not received the mysteries after they die? The Master answers:

> A righteous person who is perfect in all righteousness, but who has not received the mysteries of light, is taken by the Receivers of Light—not the Receivers of Wrath—after leaving the body. For three days, they journey with that soul through all the creatures of the world and pass it through the elements of judgment, instructing it. Then, it is taken to the Virgin of Light and sealed with an excellent seal so it can be placed into a righteous body in the aeons. In its next life, it will find the signs of the mysteries of light and inherit the Kingdom of Light forever.
>
> Similarly, a person who has sinned only a few times will be sent back into the world according to the type of sins committed. 'I will explain these types in detail when I discuss the emanation of the pleroma.' However, even a completely righteous person cannot enter the Kingdom of Light without the sign of the Kingdom of the Mysteries. Gnosis is needed in addition to righteousness.

The next question is about a sinner who has repented, received the mysteries, fallen away, and repented again, as long as he is not a hypocrite. "Should we forgive his transgressions up to seven times and give him the mysteries again?"

The Saviour responds:

> Not only should you forgive his sin up to seven times, but I say, forgive him many times seven times, and each time give him the mysteries from the beginning, the mysteries in the first Space from the exterior. Perhaps you will win that brother's soul so that he may inherit the Kingdom of Light. Truly, I tell you, anyone who saves a single soul, in addition to their own reward in the Kingdom of Light, will receive extra glory for the soul they saved. Therefore, someone who saves many souls will receive many additional glories for the souls they have saved, on top of their own proper glory.
>
> Not only should they give the lower mysteries, but also the higher mysteries, as long as the person sincerely repents and is not a hypocrite. This includes all mysteries up to the three highest mysteries of the First Mystery, because the First Mystery is compassionate and merciful.
>
> But if that person sins again, you should not forgive their sin or accept their repentance anymore; they become a stumbling-block and transgressor. Truly, I tell you, these three mysteries will testify against their last repentance. Truly, I tell you, that person's soul will no longer have a chance for the higher world, but will reside in the place of the Dragon of Outer Darkness.
>
> The disciples have no choice in this matter; if they know a person is sincere and not just curious about the rites, they must give them these mysteries and not withhold them, even if they have never received any of the lower mysteries. If they hide these from a sincere person, they will face great judgment. Beyond giving these three higher mysteries, they have no authority, as they lack sufficient knowledge.
>
> However, the case of someone who falls away after receiving the highest mysteries is not entirely hopeless; it lies in the hands of the First Mystery and the Mystery of the Ineffable alone. Only these can accept repentance from such a man and forgive his sins, for these Mysteries are "compassionate and merciful, and grant forgiveness of sins at any time."

The question arises: What if they mistakenly give the mysteries to hypocrites who deceive them and later mock the mysteries, "mimicking us and forging our mysteries"? What should they do then?

In this case, they should appeal to the First Mystery, saying: "The mystery we gave to these impious and wicked souls was not performed worthily, but they merely copied us; therefore, return that mystery to us and make them strangers to Your Kingdom forever." At that moment, the mysteries these impious souls received will be taken back, and such people can only receive pardon from the Mystery of the Ineffable.

As for the unbelieving friends and relatives of those who have received the mysteries, the latter can, through their prayers and invocations, seek a better afterlife for their relatives and friends, so they may be given favorable conditions to receive the mysteries in another life.

It is then asked whether the mysteries will save the disciples from the pains of martyrdom. "Many persecute us because of You, and multitudes pursue us because of Your name, so if we are tortured, we may reveal the mystery to leave the body without pain."

The answer is unclear; anyone who has completed the first (highest) of the three higher mysteries in life will, when it is time to leave the body, ascend to the Kingdom of Life without needing an apology or sign. However, it is not said that the pains of martyrdom can be avoided. They will be able to help others because, not only you, but all people who achieve the mystery of the resurrection of the dead, which heals from demonic possessions, sufferings, and every disease—including blindness, lameness, paralysis, muteness, and deafness—whoever receives and masters these mysteries, if they ask for anything later, whether poverty or riches, weakness or strength, disease or health, complete healing of the body, or the resurrection of the dead, the power to heal the lame, the blind, the deaf, and the mute, or any suffering and disease—in short, whoever masters this mystery, if they ask for any of these things, it will be granted to them immediately.

The disciples then cried out together in excitement: "O Savior, You fill us with great excitement because of the incredible heights You have revealed to us; You elevate our souls, making them paths that lead us to You, for they originated from You. Now, because of these transcendent heights You have revealed, our souls are enraptured and strive intensely, yearning to ascend to the realm of Your Kingdom."

The Master continued His teaching, saying that they could share the rest of the mysteries with others, but not the mystery of the resurrection of the dead and the healing of disease, "for that mystery belongs to the rulers and all its names." They should keep this as the sign of their mission so that when they perform such miracles, people will believe that they preach the God of perfection and will have faith in their words.

The next topic of instruction addressed the question: "What compels a person to sin?" This passage delves into the nature of humans and explains Gnostic psychology.

When a child is born, its "light-power," "soul," "counterfeit spirit," and "body" are all very weak. None of these elements have enough sense to do anything, good or bad, because of the overwhelming influence of forgetfulness. The baby enjoys the pleasures of the material world, and each part of its being absorbs what it needs from these pleasures: the power takes in energy from the delights, the soul from the soul's portion in the delights, the counterfeit spirit from the evil in the delights, and the body from the basic matter in the delights. There is also something called "destiny" that remains unchanged and unaffected by these pleasures. Gradually, all these parts of a person develop, each sensing according to its nature.

"The power" seeks the light of higher realms, "the soul" seeks a region of mixed righteousness (a mix of light and matter), and "the counterfeit spirit" seeks all kinds of vices, desires, and sins. The body only senses impulses to gain strength from matter. The power represents the higher mind, the soul the lower mind, and the counterfeit spirit the animalistic nature. The power urges the soul to seek the light and divine presence, while the counterfeit spirit pulls the soul down, forcing it to commit various wrongs and sins.

This counterfeit spirit acts as an enemy to the soul, making it commit sins because of past actions. For the future, it prompts the "Workmen of Wrath" to witness all the sins it will force the soul to commit. Even when a man sleeps day or night, he is tormented by dreams filled with worldly desires, making him long for everything in this world. In short, this binds the soul to actions dictated by higher powers, acting as the soul's enemy and causing it to do what it shouldn't. This force drives a man to sin and leads him to death. Then, the Receivers of Wrath come to take the soul out of the body. For three days, they travel with the soul through all the regions of the world. The counterfeit spirit and destiny follow the soul, but its power returns to the Virgin of Light.

The soul is then taken down into Chaos, where the counterfeit spirit takes control and torments it for the sins it caused the soul to commit, becoming a great enemy to the soul. The soul rises higher but is still haunted by the counterfeit spirit until it reaches the Ruler of the Way of the Midst, between the lower sky and the earth's surface. Here, it continues to face punishments from its counterfeit spirit according to its destiny.

The counterfeit spirit then brings the soul to the "light of the sun," likely representing the sublunary regions, and takes it to the Judge, the Virgin of Light, following the command of Ieou, the First Man. The Virgin of Light seals the soul and hands it over to one of her receivers to be placed into a new body, which reflects the sins it has committed. "Truly, I tell you, she will not let that soul escape from being reborn into new bodies until it shows signs of being in its final cycle according to its record of wrongdoing."

In the case of a righteous soul that has received the higher mysteries of light, when the time comes for it to leave the body, the false spirit and destiny follow it as it ascends. Before it goes far, it breaks the bonds of the false spirit, which the Rulers use to bind it to the soul. The false spirit and destiny then stop hindering the soul and return to their own regions. The soul becomes a glorious light and ascends to its inheritance, with the receivers of the soul, who belong to the light, becoming wings and a vesture of light for it. Such a soul doesn't need seals or apologies.

However, a soul that has only received the lower mysteries does need these seals and apologies, which the Master promises to provide in his detailed teaching about the emanation of the pleroma. For now, he simply mentions the spaces to be traversed and the rulers. Mary compares some of these statements with previous teachings, including one by Paul, and interprets a saying about agreeing with one's enemy on the way to avoid being judged and imprisoned. She explains this as referring to the Judge, the Virgin of Light, and the soul's reincarnation, noting that no soul is free from reincarnation until it shows signs of being in its last cycle.

Mary asks about the nature of the baptisms that forgive sins, and the Master responds:

> The false spirit records every sin the soul has committed. It not only records the sins but also marks each sin on the soul, so that all the rulers who punish sinners can recognize the soul of a sinner and know the number of sins by the number of marks the false spirit has made. This way, they can punish the soul according to the number of sins it has committed. This is how they treat a sinner's soul.
>
> When someone receives the mysteries of baptism, these mysteries become a powerful and intense fire that burns away sins. They enter the soul secretly and consume all the sins implanted by the false spirit. Once the fire has purified the sins, the mysteries then enter the body secretly to chase and eliminate the false spirit and destiny, separating them from the soul and power. The false spirit, destiny, and body are grouped together, while the soul and power are grouped separately. The mystery of baptism remains between them to keep them apart, cleanse them, and make them pure, ensuring that the soul and power are not tainted by matter.

It is further explained that the twelve and other mysteries of the First Mystery and the Ineffable are much higher than the mysteries of baptism; all of this will be explained in a future teaching. Mary interprets passages of scripture with insights from new teachings, prompted by the Master's review of certain points and checking if they are well understood. She emphasizes the boundless compassion of the highest Mysteries. She explains that if a worldly king grants favors and pardons to criminals, even those guilty of severe crimes, then the Ineffable and the First Mystery, who hold power over everything, certainly have the ability to forgive anyone who receives the Mystery.

She further illustrates that if a king sends a soldier, dressed in a royal mantle, to distant lands, and the soldier commits serious crimes but is not punished because of his royal attire, then those who are clothed in the mysteries of the Ineffable and the First Mystery have even greater protection and grace.

The Master then tests Peter's compassion with a woman who had fallen away after receiving baptism, and Peter passes the test. It is explained that someone who has received the mysteries and then fallen away without repenting is in a far worse state than someone who has never known these sacred teachings.

To those who are indifferent, thinking they have many lifetimes ahead and see no need to hurry, the Master instructs the disciples:

> Tell everyone: 'Work together to understand the mysteries of light during this challenging time and enter the Kingdom of Light. Do not postpone from day to day or from lifetime to lifetime, assuming you can obtain the mysteries in a future life.' These people do not know when the number of perfect souls will be complete. Once that number is reached, I will close the Gates of Light. After that, no one can enter or leave because the number of perfect souls will be complete, and the First Mystery will be fulfilled—the mystery from which everything originated, and I am that mystery.
>
> From that moment, no one will be able to enter the Light, and no one will leave, as the time for the number of perfect souls will be fulfilled. Before I set fire to the world to purify the realms, veils, firmaments, and the entire world—including all the material things still in it and the human race still upon it—the faith and mysteries will become more apparent. Many souls will go through cycles of reincarnation and return to the world. Among them will be some who are alive now and hear Me speak about the completion of the number of perfect souls. In those days, they will find and receive the mysteries of light.
>
> They will ascend to the Gates of Light and see that the number of perfect souls is complete, marking the fulfillment of the First Mystery and the Knowledge of the Pleroma. They will find that I have closed the Gates of Light, and from that moment, no one can enter or leave. These souls will cry out through the Gates of Light, saying, "Master, open to us."
>
> I will reply, "I do not know where you come from." They will say, "We have received the mysteries and followed all your teachings on the highways."
>
> I will respond, "I do not know who you are; you who have practiced wickedness and evil up to this day. Therefore, go into the Outer Darkness." They will then go to the Outer Darkness, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth.

Mary then asks about the nature of the Outer Darkness and the number of its spaces and regions of punishment. An elaborate description follows of the space-dragon in the Outer Darkness, whose tail is in its mouth, and its twelve dungeons, along with the faces and names of the rulers, the doors, and the angels that guard them. It is explained how souls enter the Dragon and their torments and the levels of the fires.

The teaching then explains how the souls of the uninitiated can be saved, and how the Mystery will ultimately save even those who have no chance of rebirth. It describes how the initiated become light-flames and streams of light. Mary pleads for those who have neglected the mysteries, and the power of the names of the twelve rulers of the dungeons is explained. It shows how the souls who know these names escape from the Dragon and are taken to Ieou, and their subsequent fate.

The text then provides new instructions about the Rulers of Fate and the Draught of Oblivion, describing "the seed of sin, filled with all kinds of desire and forgetfulness... This deadly draught of oblivion becomes a body external to the soul, resembling the soul in every way, and is therefore called the counterfeit spirit." It continues by explaining how a new soul is created and how power is breathed into it, with a promise of more detailed information later.

It clarifies that the phrase "He who shall not leave father and mother and follow after Me" refers to the creators or shapers of the soul and counterfeit spirit, not to our earthly parents, and certainly not to the parents of the inner light-power—the Savior and His mysteries.

Additionally, more information is given about the counterfeit spirit and its 365 elemental builders, the stages of incarnation, the karmic influence of physical parents, the occult process of gestation, the way various elements incarnate in a person, occult physiognomy, the nature of destiny and how death occurs, and other related topics.

And then the Savior continues:

> I have come into the world for the sake of sinners, to save them. It is also necessary for the righteous, who have never done evil or sinned, to discover the mysteries in the Books of Ieou. I had Enoch write these books in Paradise when I spoke to him from the Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life. I had him hide them in the rock of Ararat, and I appointed Kalapatauroth, the Ruler over Skemmut, to protect these books from the flood and from any rulers who might want to destroy them out of spite. I will give these books to you after I finish explaining the emanation of the pleroma.

However, only a few will understand the higher mysteries. "I tell you that only one in a thousand and two in ten thousand will comprehend the mysteries of the First Mystery." Before the arrival of the First Mystery, no human soul had fully entered the Light; none of the prophets or patriarchs had entered the Light yet. They will be sent back into righteous bodies to discover the mysteries and inherit the Kingdom.

The treatise concludes with the following paragraphs:

> Mary answered and said: 'We are blessed above all people because of the great truths You have revealed to us.' The Savior replied to Mary and all His disciples: 'I will also reveal to you all the wonders of the heights, from the innermost to the outermost, so that you may be perfect in every knowledge, in every pleroma, in every height of the heights, and in every depth of the depths.'
>
> Mary replied to the Savior: "Now we fully understand, Master, that you have brought the keys to the mysteries of the Kingdom of Light. These keys forgive the sins of souls, allowing them to be cleansed, transformed into pure light, and brought into the Light."

#### Summary of Extracts from the Books of the Savior

The first extract appears on pages 252-254 of the Askew Codex and states:

> Those who are worthy of the mysteries within the Ineffable, meaning those who have not emanated, are before the First Mystery. To help you understand, they are like the parts of the Ineffable. Each part has its own glory: the head has the glory of the head, the eye has the glory of the eye, the ear has the glory of the ear, and so on. This shows that 'there are many parts, but only one body.' I speak in metaphors and parallels, not in exact terms; I have not revealed the complete truth.
>
> But the Mystery of the Ineffable and each part within it, that is, those who dwell in the Mystery of the Ineffable and those who dwell within it, and also the three Spaces that follow them according to the mysteries, all of that is Myself. I am the Treasure of all of them, without which there is no treasure or individuality in the world; however, there are other words, other mysteries, and other regions.
>
> Therefore, blessed is the one who has found the mysteries of the Space towards the exterior. That person is like a God, who has found the words of the mysteries of the second Space in the middle."He is a Savior, free from all limitations, who has discovered the words of the mysteries, the words of the third space inward. He is the fullness itself, or even more excellent than the universe—the desire of everyone in that third space—who has found the mystery in which they all exist. Therefore, he is equal to them all. For he has also discovered the words of the mysteries, which I have written for you as a symbol, namely, the Limbs of the Ineffable.
>
> Truly, I say to you, whoever has found the words of these mysteries in the Truth of God, that person is foremost in the Truth and is equal to it because of these words and mysteries. The universe indeed owes its existence to these words and mysteries. For this reason, whoever has found the words of these mysteries is equal to the Chief of all. This is the knowledge of the Ineffable that I speak to you about today.

The second part of the extracts is much longer and appears at the end of the Codex, covering pages 357-390. It starts with the words:

> After they had crucified Jesus, our Master, He rose from the dead on the third day. And the disciples gathered around Him and pleaded, saying, 'Master, have mercy on us, for we have left our families and the whole world to follow You.'

We are immediately introduced to a setting of ceremonies and invocations. Jesus stands by the Sea of the Ocean, surrounded by His disciples, both men and women, and makes an invocation with a solemn prayer, saying, "Hear me, O Father, Father of all fatherhood, Boundless Light!" The prayer includes mystic vowels and formulas interspersed with "authentic" names.

The disciples are grouped around Him, with the women disciples standing behind, all dressed in white linen robes. Jesus stands at an altar and, with His disciples, turns to the four directions, invoking the name IAO three times. The interpretation is: "I, the fullness, have gone forth; A, they shall return within; O, there will be an end of all ends."

This is followed by a mystical formula, which means: "O Father of every fatherhood of the boundless light-spaces, hear me because of my disciples, whom I have brought into your presence, so they may believe in all the words of your truth. Grant them everything I have asked for, for I know the Name of the Father of the Treasure of Light."

Then Jesus, whose secret name is Aberamentho, calls upon the Name of the Father of the Treasure, saying: "Let all the mysteries of the rulers, authorities, archangels, and all the powers and works of the Invisible Gods withdraw and move to the right..."

At that moment, all the lower regions move quickly to the west, to the left of the sun and moon. The sun is symbolized as a vast dragon with its tail in its mouth, mounted on seven powers and drawn by four others depicted as horses. The moon is portrayed as a ship, with two dragon-shaped steering oars, one male and one female. It is drawn by two oxen and steered by a baby at the back, with a cat's face at the front.

Jesus and His disciples ascend into the aerial regions, the Way of the Midst, reaching the first level of this path. Here, the disciples are taught about the nature of this space and its rulers. They learn that above them are Twelve Aeons, six ruled by Adamas and six by Iabraoth. The six under Iabraoth have repented and practiced the mysteries of light, and as a result, they have been brought by Ieou, "the father of my father," to a pure atmosphere near the light of the sun. The six beings under Adamas have rejected the mysteries of light and instead focused on sexual union, resulting in the creation of rulers, archangels, angels, workers, and decans. As a consequence, they have been confined by Ieou in the Fate-Sphere.

Now, there are 360 of these beings, with 1,800 more in each era. Ieou has appointed five Great Rulers over them, known to humans as Kronos, Ares, Hermes, Aphrodite, and Zeus. Their true, incorruptible names and origins are also provided. Zeus is the leader because Ieou decided they needed a guide to steer the world and the spheres' eras. Zeus is good and spends three months with each of the other four ruling powers, purifying them. Zeus has two eras as his domain. This arrangement pertains to the Fate-Sphere's order.

However, Mary, who often asks questions, wants to know why the aerial Ways of the Midst, located below the Fate-Sphere, are associated with great torment. She pleads with the Savior to have mercy on them to prevent their souls from being taken to the judgments of the Ways of the Midst. The Master promises to give them the mysteries of all knowledge, including the mystery of the Twelve Aeons of the Rulers, their seals, their numbers, and how to invoke them; the mystery of the Thirteenth Aeon (the Left); the mystery of the Baptism of those in the Midst; the mystery of the Baptism of those on the Right; and the great mystery of the Treasure of Light.

> I will give you all the mysteries and all knowledge so that you may be called the Sons of the Pleroma, perfect in every knowledge and mystery. You are indeed blessed beyond all men on earth, for the Sons of Light have come in your time. In these middle ways, Ieou has bound 360 beings of the brood of Adamas, and five great rulers are established over them, mirroring the space above. The names, types, and sub-hierarchies of these five are provided.

It is explained that everything is ordered by Ieou, who oversees all rulers, gods, and powers in the matter of the Light of the Treasure, and by Zorokothora (Melchizedec), the representative of all purified light-powers among the Rulers. These two great Lights descend at specific times to gather the pure light from those they have cleansed among the Rulers. This happens when the time and number of their task are fulfilled. When the great Lights withdraw, the Rulers rebel again due to their iniquity and attack the light-powers of souls, capturing and destroying as many souls as they can in their darkness and evil fire.

The duration souls must spend in each of these five regions of punishment is given, and how these times end. For example, after certain years, when the sphere of Little Sabaoth (Zeus) moves into the first aeon of the Sphere, called the Ram of Bubastis (Aphrodite), and when Aphrodite reaches the seventh house of the Sphere, the Balance, the veils between the Right and the Left are lifted. 

Then, from above, the Great Sabaoth, the Good, lord of the whole world and the Sphere, shines forth among those on the Right. Before he looks out, he gazes down at the regions ruled by Paraplex, the leader of the first demonic hierarchy, so they may be dissolved and perish. The souls suffering under Paraplex are then freed and led back into the Sphere, since they are being tormented. This process is repeated for the other four of the five regions, with appropriate changes. Ieou and Melchizedec seem to symbolize or hold power behind the sun and moon.

"These are the operations of the Ways of the Midst that you asked Me about," Jesus told His disciples. Hearing this, the disciples bowed down and worshipped Him, saying, "Save us, Master, have mercy on us so we may be spared from these terrible torments prepared for sinners. Woe to them! Woe to humanity, for they are like the blind, groping in darkness, unable to see. Have mercy on us, Master, in our great blindness, and have mercy on all humankind; for their souls are hunted like prey by lions, ready to tear them apart and use them for their torments, due to their forgetfulness and ignorance. Have mercy on us, Master, our Savior, save us from this deep stupor."

Jesus said to His disciples, "Take courage, do not fear, for you are blessed. I will make you rulers over all these and place them under your control. Remember, I told you before My crucifixion, 'I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven.' Now, I say it again, I will give them to you." After speaking, Jesus chanted an invocation in the Great Name, and the regions of the Ways of the Midst disappeared from view.

Jesus and His disciples were surrounded by an exceedingly great light. Jesus said to His disciples, "Come to Me," and they came to Him. He turned towards the four corners of the world, spoke the Great Name over their heads, blessed them, and breathed on their eyes. Jesus said to them, "Look up and see what you can." They looked up and saw a brilliant light that no one could describe.

Jesus told them again, "Look into the light and see what is there." They replied, "We see fire, water, wine, and blood." Jesus, also known as Aberamentho, said to His disciples, "Truly, I tell you, I brought nothing into the world except this fire, water, wine, and blood. I brought the water and fire from the Light of light, from the Treasure of Light. I brought the wine and blood from the region of Barbelo.

Shortly after, My Father sent the Holy Spirit to Me in the form of a dove. The fire, water, and wine cleanse all the sins of the world. The blood signifies the body of humankind, which I received from the region of Barbelo, the great power of the Divine Invisible. The Spirit draws all souls and brings them into the region of Light. This is the ‘fire’ I came to ‘cast on the earth,’ as I said before. This is the ‘living water’ the Samaritan woman should have asked for. This is the ‘cup of wine’ in the Eucharist, and the ‘water’ that came from My side. These are the mysteries of the light that forgive sins—meaning their names only. After this, Jesus commanded that the powers of the Left return to their region, and the disciples found themselves back on the Mount of Galilee.

Then Jesus celebrated the mystical Eucharist and the first Baptism of Water, with ceremonies and invocations similar to those in the Codex Brucianus. The disciples asked further about the nature of the Baptism of Incense. Fire, the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, and the Spiritual Chrism, and ask that the "Mystery of the Light of Your Father" be revealed to them.

Jesus said to them: "Regarding these mysteries you seek, there is none higher than them. They will lead your souls into the Light of lights, into the realms of Truth and Righteousness, into the region of the Holy of Holies. In that place, there is neither male nor female, nor any form—only unending, indescribable Light.

"There is no mystery higher than the mysteries you seek, except for the mystery of the Seven Voices and their Forty-Nine Powers and Numbers, and the Name that is above them all, the Name that encompasses all their names, lights, and powers..."

Here the text breaks off, and resumes with a completely different subject. It discusses the punishment of those who curse, slander, murder, steal, show contempt, blaspheme, engage in same-sex relations, and commit an even more heinous act of sorcery, which provokes the Master's immense compassion to anger and condemnation.

The remaining pages of the Codex describe the after-death state of the righteous man who has not received the mysteries. Each sin must be suffered for, but even the greatest sinner, if he repents, shall inherit the Kingdom. The favorable time for the birth of those who will find the mysteries is also described. For the righteous person who has not been initiated, in their next life, they will not be given the drink of forgetfulness. Instead, a messenger from the Good Sabaoth will come, bringing a cup full of intuition, wisdom, and prudence. This cup will ensure that the soul remains alert and mindful, always seeking the mysteries of light until they are found, as directed by the Virgin of Light, so that the soul may inherit eternal Light.

The fragments conclude with the disciples asking Jesus for mercy, and the Codex ends with a note from a scribe about the apostles' preaching:

"They went out in pairs to the four corners of the earth, spreading the Good News of the Kingdom everywhere, with Christ supporting them through confirming words, signs, and wonders. Thus, the Kingdom of God was known throughout the land and the world of Israel, serving as a testimony to all nations from east to west."

#### The Summary of the Fragments of the "Book of the Great Logos According to the Mystery"

The first page begins with the words: "I have loved you and longed to give you Life." This is followed by a statement: "This is the Book of the Knowledges of the Invisible God," which is the Book of the Knowledge of Jesus the Living One. Through this book, all hidden mysteries are revealed to the chosen ones. Jesus, the Saviour of Souls, the Logos of Life, was sent by the Father from the Light-world to humanity. He taught His disciples the one true doctrine, saying: "This is the doctrine in which all Knowledge resides." This appears to be an introduction written by an editor or compiler.

Immediately after, a dialogue begins between Jesus and the disciples. Jesus says, "Blessed is the person who overcomes the world and doesn't let the world overcome him." He then explains that this person is someone who has found His Word and fulfilled it according to the Father's will.

The apostles ask the Master to tell them this Word because they have left everything to follow Him and want to learn about the Life of the Father. Jesus responds that the Life of His Father involves purifying their souls from all earthly stains and becoming the Race of the Mind, so they can be filled with understanding. Through His teaching, they can perfect themselves and be saved from the rulers of this world and its endless traps.

He urges them to quickly receive the knowledge He is about to share—His Word—because He is free from all worldly stains. The disciples praise the Master as the Light shining in the daytime, who has enlightened their hearts so they can receive the Light of Life through the knowledge that teaches the hidden wisdom of the Lord.

Jesus says, "Blessed is the person who knows this Word, brings Heaven down, and lifts the Earth upwards; the Earth becomes the middle, meaning it is nothing." Heaven is explained as the invisible Word of the Father. Those who know this Word—who become children of the true Mind—bring Heaven to Earth. Raising Earth to Heaven means ceasing to have an earthly intelligence by receiving the Word of these teachings and becoming a Dweller in Heaven. In doing so, they will be saved from the Ruler of this World, who will become insignificant to them, having no effect on them. The evil powers will envy them because they know Him, understanding that He is not of this world and that no evil comes from Him. However, those born of unrighteousness and not part of the Righteous Race will have no place in the Kingdom of the Father.

The disciples despair because they have been born "according to the flesh" and have known Him only "according to the flesh." The Master explains that it is not about the physical flesh, but the flesh of unrighteousness and ignorance. The disciples ask to be taught about ignorance (the opposite of knowledge), and the Master tells them that to understand this great mystery, they must first embody His purity and righteousness, wear His robe of glory, and seek to understand the teachings of the Word. Through this, they will come to know Him in the Fullness of the Father. The apostles respond, "Lord Jesus, teach us the Fullness and it will suffice us."

Unfortunately, the text breaks off here and no direct continuation is found. In Schmidt's Second Book of Ieou, we find the following narrative:

Jesus asks the twelve disciples and the women disciples to gather around Him and promises to reveal the great mysteries of the Treasure of Light, which even the powers of the Thirteenth Aeon do not know. If these mysteries are fulfilled, neither the Rulers of the Twelve Aeons nor the powers of the Invisible God can endure or understand them, for they are the profound mysteries of the innermost Treasure of Light. When these processes are complete, the Receivers of the Light-treasure come and take the soul from the body, carrying it through all lower realms into the Light-treasure. All sins of that soul, whether known or unknown, are erased, and the soul becomes pure Light. The purified soul not only passes through all lower realms but also enters into the Light-realm, moving inward through all its spaces, orders, and powers, to the innermost space of the Light-treasure.

These mysteries must be kept with the utmost secrecy and revealed to no one unworthy—not to father or mother, sister or brother, or any relative; not for food or drink, not for a woman or gold or silver, or anything in this world. Especially not to sorcerers, who practice foul rites and whose god is the son of the Great Ruler, Sabaoth Adamas—the enemy of the Kingdom of Heaven and leader of the six unrepentant Rulers. The mystery-name of this power is given and its monstrous form described.

Only those who have abandoned the entire world and all its gods and powers, and have placed their complete faith in the Light, listening to and submitting to one another like children of the Light, are worthy of the mysteries of the Light-treasure (the emanation of the Unapproachable God).

Since the disciples have left their father, mother, siblings, and all their possessions, and have followed Him, fulfilling His commandments, Jesus promises to reveal to them the mysteries:

The mystery of the Twelve Aeons and their Receivers, and how to invoke them so that the disciples can pass through their realms; the mystery of the Invisible God (the Thirteenth Aeon) and his Receivers (those of the Left), and those of the Middle, and those of the Right. Before anything else, He will give them the mysteries of the three Baptisms: the Baptism of Water, the Baptism of Fire, and the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. Additionally, He will provide the Mystery of Removing the Malice of the Rulers, followed by the Mystery of the Spiritual Anointing.

However, they must remember that when they pass on these mysteries to others, they must instruct them not to swear falsely or swear at all; not to commit fornication or adultery; not to steal or covet others' belongings; not to love silver or gold; not to invoke the names of the seventy-two evil Rulers or their angels for any purpose; not to rob, curse, slander, or speak falsely. They should simply let their "yes" mean yes and their "no" mean no. In short, they must follow the good commandments.

The disciples remind Jesus that His first promise was to give them the mysteries of the Treasure of Light, which are greater than the lower mysteries He mentioned. Since the disciples have not only given up everything in the world and kept all the commandments but have also followed Him for twelve years, Jesus assures them that He will also give them the mysteries of the Light-treasure. These include the mystery of the Nine Guardians of the three Gates of the Light-treasure and how to invoke them to pass through their realms; the mystery of the Child of the Child; the Three Amens; the Five Trees; the Seven Voices; the will or mystery of the Forty-nine Powers; and the mystery of the Great Name of all names, which is the Great Light that encompasses or is beyond the Treasure of Light.

The master-mysteries of the Light-treasure are those of the Five Trees, the Seven Voices, and the Great Name. There is another great Mystery that grants a person all other blessings—the Mystery of the Forgiveness of Sins. This Mystery transforms the soul into pure light, allowing it to enter the Light of lights. Such souls have already inherited the Kingdom of God while still on earth. They share in the Light-treasure and are immortal beings. Upon death, when they leave their bodies, all the Aeons scatter and flee west, to the left, until the souls reach the Gates of the Light-treasure. The Gates open for them, and the Wardens give them their seals and Great Name. They pass through various Orders, receiving successive seals and master-words, moving through the Five Trees and Seven Voices, and further still.

They enter the Orders of the Parentless, reaching the spaces of their inheritance—the Order of the Thrice-spiritual—until they arrive at the space of Ieou, the Lord over the entire Treasure—the central Treasure. From there, they go deeper into the inner Treasures, the innermost spaces, to the Silences, to Eternal Peace, in those Everlasting Spaces. Jesus promises to give all these mysteries to His disciples so they may be called "Children of the Fullness (Pleroma) perfected in all mysteries."

The Master then gathers His disciples, men and women, and says: "Come, all of you, and receive the three Baptisms before I tell you the mystery of the Rulers!" He instructs them to go to Galilee and find a person in whom most evil is dead, meaning someone who has ceased from sexual activity, and get from them two jars of wine and bring them to Him, along with two vine branches.

They follow his instructions, and the Master prepares an offering by placing a wine jar on each side and scattering berries and spices around them. He then has the disciples dress in white linen robes, puts a specific plant in their mouths, gives them another plant and the number of the Seven Voices to hold in their hands, and arranges them around the offering. Jesus spreads a linen cloth, places a cup and bread on it according to the number of disciples, surrounds it with olive branches, and puts olive wreaths on the disciples' heads. He marks their foreheads with a special seal (details and meaning of which are provided).

The Master and his disciples then turn to face the four corners of the world, and the disciples are instructed to stand with their feet together in a prayerful stance. He offers a prayer beginning with an invocation in a mystical language, interspersed with three Amens, and continues:

> Hear me, My Father, Father of all fathers, Boundless Light in the Treasure of Light. May the Supporters who serve the Seven Virgins of Light, who oversee the Baptism of Life, come! [The mystery-names of the Supporters are provided here.] May they come and baptize My disciples with the Water of Life from the Seven Virgins of Light, wash away their sins, cleanse their wrongdoings, and include them among the heirs of the Kingdom of Light!
>
> If You have heard me and shown mercy to My disciples, if they are counted among the heirs of the Kingdom of Light, if You have forgiven their sins and erased their wrongdoings, then let a miracle happen, and may Zorokothora come and bring the Water of the Baptism of Life into one of these wine jars!

The miracle occurs, and the wine in the right-hand jar turns into water. Jesus baptizes the people, gives them the sacrament, and marks them with a seal, bringing them great joy. This is the Baptism of Water.

The next ritual described is the Baptism of Fire. In this ceremony, vine branches are used and sprinkled with various incense materials. The eucharist is prepared similarly, and most details are almost the same, including the use of the Seven Voices, though the seal differs. The prayer is longer but serves the same purpose.

This time, the baptizer is the Virgin of Life, the Judge, who provides the Water of the Baptism of Fire. A miracle is requested in "the fire of this fragrant incense," and it is performed by Zorokothora, also known as Melchizedec. The nature of the miracle is not specified. Jesus baptizes the disciples, gives them the eucharistic sacrifice, and marks their foreheads with the seal of the Virgin of Light.

Next is the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. This ceremony uses both wine jars and vine branches, with otherwise similar details and again involving the Seven Voices. The specific givers of this Baptism are not mentioned, but since the final sealing is done with the seal of the Seven Virgins of Light, it is assumed they are the givers. Another unspecified miracle occurs.

Following this is the Mystery of Withdrawing the Evil of the Rulers. There is no mention of the eucharist in this part, but the ceremony is otherwise similar and includes an elaborate incense offering. The number involved is that of the First Amen, and the seal used is very intricate. The prayer asks that Sabaoth Adamas and all his chiefs may come and remove the evil or wrongdoing from the disciples. At the end of the prayer, the disciples are marked with the seal of the Second Amen, and the Rulers no longer have any power over them. They become immortal and can follow Jesus anywhere they wish to go.

Jesus then gives the disciples the mysteries of the Baptisms, the way to invoke the powers, their numbers, seals, and true names. He promises to give them the defenses or formulas that will allow them to enter the inner realms of these powers and pass through them. With this knowledge, when they leave their bodies, they will be able to pass through the realms of the six Aeons that have not repented, the realms of Sabaoth Adamas. These realms and their rulers will disperse before them. However, when they reach the six great Aeons of Iabraoth, who repented and believed in the Light, they will be stopped until they receive the Mystery of the Forgiveness of Sins.

The Mystery of the Forgiveness of Sins is found deep within the Treasures of Light and is the perfect salvation of the soul. Whoever receives it is greater than all the gods and powers of the twelve Aeons of the Invisible God, the Ruler of the Thirteenth Aeon. This Mystery is the Great Mystery of the Unapproachable God, and it perfects all other mysteries, making the soul complete. It is this Mystery that will allow the disciples to pass into the Aeons of the Invisible God, the spaces beyond what physical eyes can see, beyond the elements of water, fire, and air (or ether), the baptismal mysteries of which have already been given.

Using the Mystery of the Forgiveness of Sins, all the Aeons will retreat to the west, to the left, like veils before the eyes, up to the twelfth Aeon. This Aeon will be purified by the Light of the Light-treasure, clearing all the paths the disciples have ascended. The outer part of the Light-treasure (the exterior being the Space of the Thirteenth Aeon) will be revealed, allowing them to see Heaven from below.

At this point, Jesus will give them the symbols, seals, and numbers of the Mystery along with their meanings. When they receive these and leave their bodies, they will become pure light and ascend into the Light-treasure. The Guardians of the Gates of the Treasure will open to them, letting them pass through the inner spaces. The powers within these spaces will welcome them, giving them their mysteries, seals, and names of power. These include the Orders of the Three Amens, the Child of the Child, the Twin Saviours, the Great Sabaoth, the Great Iao the Good, the Seven Amens, the Five Trees, and the Seven Voices. There are also the Orders of the Uncontainables, the Impassables, and those beyond them in time and space; the Unstainables and those beyond them; the Immovables and those beyond them; the Parentless and those before them. Additionally, there are the Orders of the Five Impressions, the Three Spaces, the Five Supporters, the Thrice-spiritual, the Triple Power, the First Precept, the Inheritance, the Silences and Peace, and the Veils before the Great King of the Light-treasure, up to the Great Man himself, the King of the entire Light-realm, named Ieou.

These spaces and orders are also mentioned in the Pistis Sophia treatise, but I left them out of the summary to avoid confusing the reader. The topic is extremely complex, and no one has been able to fully reconstruct the detailed Gnostic scheme assumed by the writer or writers of our treatises.

This is largely due to the incomplete state of the Codex Brucianus and the lack of data in the Askew Codex. Still, they are to ascend to the Space of the Great Light, which surrounds or transcends the outer Treasure of Light itself. Ieou is there too; he is the Great Light. This is the Second, or inner, Light Treasure. The guardians will open the Gates, allowing passage into the Orders of the Triple Powers of the Second Light Treasure. From there, they will move inward to the twelfth Order of the twelfth Great Power of the emanation of the True God. There are twelve Great Powers, each with twelve Chiefs in their Orders (with the authentic names provided). These Twelve will stand in this Space and call upon the True God with this "Name" (or prayer), saying:

> Hear us, O Father, Father of all fatherhood [Here follows a sentence in a mystery language containing four of the vowels each repeated seven times, with the interpretation: Father of all fatherhood, for everything has come from the Alpha and will return to the Omega when the final consummation occurs.] We now invoke Your imperishable Names so that You may send forth Your great Light-power to follow these Twelve Uncontainables [meaning the twelve disciples], for they have truly received the Mystery of the Forgiveness of Sins, and therefore should not be prevented from approaching Your Light-Treasure.

The True God will send His Light-power, which will shine from behind the disciples and cause all the Treasures of the Second Light-realm to withdraw. These treasures will then reach the Space of the True God. The True God will pray to the Unapproachable God, the One and Only, who will send a Light-power from Himself into the Space of the True God. The disciples will be perfected and become an Order in that Treasure. They will sing hymns of praise to the Unapproachable God because, even while still in their bodies, they have received the Mystery of the Forgiveness of Sins and reached the Space of the True God.

The disciples ask to be given this Great Mystery. The Master promises to give it, but first, they must learn about the mystery of the Twelve Aeons, their seals, names, and explanations. These details are provided, including seal diagrams, names, numbers, and explanations. The explanations take the form of phrases like "Make way [mystery names], ye Rulers of the first (second, etc.) Aeon, for I invoke [other mystery names--these being superior names of the Light-treasure]."

The sixth or seventh Aeon is called the Little Midst because it belongs to the six Aeons that have believed in the Light. The Rulers of these Aeons have some goodness in them. In the twelfth Aeon are the Invisible God, Barbelo, and the Ingenerable God. The Invisible God is in a space alone in the twelfth Aeon with veils drawn before Him, along with many other gods called the great rulers of the Aeons, who serve the Invisible God, Barbelo, and the Ingenerable God.

In the thirteenth Aeon are the Great Invisible God, the Great Virginal Spirit (possibly Barbelo), and the twenty-four emanations of the Invisible God. The mystery-names of these twenty-four entities are given, along with the invocation of the higher names of the Light-treasure, which includes a series of triple omegas repeated four times and a series of triple etas repeated four times. The names of these emanations are said to be their original names.

Higher up in the fourteenth Aeon, there is a second Great Invisible God and another Great God called the "Great Just One" (xrestos), who is a power of the three Light-rulers within all the Aeons but outside the Treasure of Light. Here, there are also many emanations. The powers of this Aeon will try to detain the disciples so they may perform the mysteries of Jesus in those spaces, and in doing so, these powers themselves receive additional powers from the powers of the Light-treasure. However, the disciples are given the proper seals, numbers, and apologies to make the powers withdraw.

The three Great Rulers within all these Invisibles (the emanations of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Aeons) but outside the Treasure of Light are called the Triple-powered Gods and are above all others. They have received the mysteries of the Treasure of Light.

When the First Power emerged from the Light-kingdom, they initially remained in it, and when they emerged, the Kingdom of Light was preached to them. "I gave them," says the Master, "the mysteries I have given you, but I have not given them the Mystery of the Forgiveness of Sins. Therefore, now I say to you that when I separate all the Aeons, I will give these three Rulers of the Light, who are in the highest Aeon, the Mystery of the Forgiveness of Sins because they have believed in the Mystery of the Light-realm."

No one can go beyond them without receiving the Mystery of the Forgiveness of Sins. However, the Master reassures that there is no need to fear because there is no place of punishment in those areas, as their inhabitants have received the Mysteries, possibly of Baptism. The seals, names, and explanations of these powers are provided, but unfortunately, the text abruptly ends here, marking the conclusion of Schmidt's Second Book of Ieou.

In Schmidt's First Book, there is a description of the middle Light-world and its ruler, the True God, also known as the Demiurgos. Above this ruler are the Treasures of the Pleroma of the Father. Jesus continues as the narrator. The topic is highly complex, involving infinite emanations, treasures (storehouses of riches and fullness), spaces, orders, and hierarchies, along with diagrams, symbols, and numerous "authentic" names, which are said to be "in the language of my Father."

The authentic name of the supernal Demiurgos is translated as the True God or God of Truth and is given in Greek transliteration as Ieou. Schmidt transliterates this into German as Jeu. It is suggested that Ieou is a transliteration of the four-letter mystery name of the creator in Semitic and Chaldaean tradition, the tetragrammaton of the Kabalah. Theodoret mentions that the Samaritans pronounced this name as Iabe (Iave) and the Jews as Iao.

Since the sixteenth century, by adding the vowels of Adonai to the unpronounceable Y H V H, it has been pronounced Jehovah. It is now generally written as Yahweh, though there is no certainty, and it is known that Jehovah is incorrect. Ieou or Iao are likely Greek transliterations of the same Semitic name, which contained letters not representable in Greek. This name might be related to Yahoo or Yahuwh, possibly hidden in Iacchus (Yach), and later corrupted into Bacchus by the Greeks. Iacchus was the secret name for the creative power in a significant mystery tradition, while Bacchus was the name used in the popular cult.

Now, let's continue with our summary. Jesus, the Living One, has seemingly taken his disciples with Him through the unseen world and brought them to the plane of the True God. Here, He gives mystical teachings about the universe's creation in the Realm of Light. He first shows them Ieou in his pure form, as a simple emanation from the Father's Ineffable Treasures, before Ieou himself has sent forth emanations by the Father's command. A combination of letters and signs is said to be the "name" of this God, indicating the planes below or sub-planes of that realm.

Next, there is a diagram—a square surrounding a circle, with another square inside containing three lines. This diagram represents the treasures over which Ieou will rule and also represents Ieou himself before he emanated. From Ieou, many emanations will come forth by the Father's command, and these emanations will become fathers of treasures, each also called Ieou. Jesus, as the Logos, orchestrates this order, but the True God is the father of all these fathers because he is a direct emanation from the Father. Through him, all subsequent emanations will proceed.

Additionally, from each subordinate Ieou, other hosts will emerge by the Father's command to fill the treasures, and they will be called Orders or hierarchies of the Treasures of Light. Countless beings will arise from them. We are, therefore, in the Light-kingdom. We are then given a diagram representing the True God before he emanated, meaning when all future emanations were still potential within him. The diagram resembles an egg, with a smaller egg or nucleus inside it containing three lines. The top parts of both the egg and the nucleus are missing, likely to show the creative Light-beam from the Father entering them.

It's likely that in these diagrams, squares represent treasures or the material aspect, while circles represent gods or the energy aspect. These can switch roles because the material of one level becomes the energy of the level below. The three lines seem to symbolize the potential triad or trinity present in all creation, and this triad, within the four-sided squares, produces an infinite order of twelves. We should remember that these diagrams are probably not reproduced accurately, due to translation and repeated copying by unskilled scribes. The three lines are said to be the three Voices that Ieou will send out when ordered "to praise the Father," meaning to create, as this is how the creative song of praise is performed.

Next, we see a diagram of the first moment of this creation; it's interesting that the symbols look like a sperm and egg. Inside a square is a small circle with its diameter extended, resembling a sperm's head and tail; the egg consists of three concentric circles, the innermost being the same size as the sperm's head, also with a diameter. Thus, two of the lines or Voices are still hidden, with only one visible. Following this is a diagram where the top half repeats the previous one, and the bottom half consists of six concentric circles with a point at the center. The latter is called the seal (xarakter) on the face or forehead of Ieou and is said to represent the treasures.

This emanation from the True God occurs when a Light-power flows into the True God from the ineffable treasures above, in response to Jesus invoking the Name of His Father as the Logos. The Light-power is called the "Little Idea," likely to indicate that although it has the power to energize all creation, it is small compared to the true "Greatnesses" or Ideas in the Divine Mind.

What follows is beyond my ability to summarize. We have diagrams of a series of twenty-eight Ieous, before the text breaks off suddenly. It is now impossible to determine the original full number; Schmidt guesses it was thirty. The diagrams appear to have been copied carelessly but share certain general features. The upper part usually consists of six squares, one inside the other. Inside the smallest square is the word Ieou and the special mystery-name of the Ieou or treasure the diagram represents. These names are generally placed above a small oblong figure (or two lines), which are said to represent the "root" of the spaces or regions where the particular Ieou is located.

Above and below, cutting through the top and bottom sides of the six squares, are two parallel lines, which are said to denote the paths one must travel to enter the space of the father of the treasure. These paths where they cross the sides of the square are marked by Greek letters, alphas, which are said to represent the curtains or veils drawn before the father. Above each diagram of squares, we find three lines or strokes, now said to be the three Gates or Doors of each treasure. Each treasure has twelve orders, with the authentic names of the Heads of each order listed, along with the authentic names of the three Guardians or Watchers of the Gates. The lower half of each diagram shows the seal on the forehead of the Ieou. These seals are mostly circles with different contents, but it's very hard to see any connection between them.

Between the second and third Ieou diagram is a figure completely different from the rest. I have no idea what it means. After it, Jesus says: "From these orders, I will take Twelve and arrange them for Myself, so they may serve Me." This likely refers to the souls of the disciples that Jesus chooses for Himself before they are born, as we learn from the Pistis Sophia. The text suddenly stops at the twenty-eighth diagram, and according to Schmidt's arrangement, the next part is a hymn sung by Jesus to the First Mystery. After printing this fragment here, Schmidt decided these pages must belong to another work because they don't fit with the rest.

We are now in the lower plane of the Thirteen Aeons. Each Aeon has its own father or creator, its Ieou, with rulers and subordinate powers called decans and liturgi, meaning servants, ministers, or workers. There are thirteen praises, one for each Aeon, but the text of the first four is missing. Each petition generally follows this form:

> Listen to me while I sing Your praises, O First Mystery, who shone forth in his mystery [the mystery of that Aeon]; it was Your Light that made Ieou create this Aeon and establish its rulers, ministers, and workers. [Then comes the "imperishable name" of the Aeon.] Save all my Members (Limbs), which have been scattered among all the rulers, ministers, and workers of this Aeon since the beginning of the world, and gather them together and bring them into the Light!

The final petition ends with three Amens. The unique aspect of the praise associated with the Thirteenth Aeon is that it is considered a separate plane or space. By the command of the First Mystery, the Ieou of this space created the space of the twenty-four invisible emanations, including all their rulers, gods, lords, archangels, angels, ministers, and workers. Additionally, the "three gods" are assigned to the space of the Thirteenth Aeon. Furthermore, by the command of the First Mystery, the six Rulers under Iabraoth who believed in the Light-kingdom are placed just below the Thirteenth Aeon in a space of pure air, while the six unrepentant Rulers are assigned to the lower impure atmosphere.

Regarding the scattering of the Limbs, we remind the reader of Epiphanius' quote from The Gospel of Philip: "I have recognized myself and gathered myself from all sides. I have not sown children to the Ruler [the lord of this world], but have uprooted his roots; I have gathered my scattered limbs, and I know who you are."

We now move to a new topic. Jesus is leading His twelve disciples through the Treasures of the Middle Light-world, giving them the seals, numbers, and authentic names needed to enter and pass through these Treasures. There are sixty Treasures, but our story begins at the fifty-sixth, as the intervening pages are missing.

From the information provided, I believe there were also sixty diagrams of Ieou's, not just thirty as Schmidt suggests. Fundamentally, there were likely twelve main treasures, each viewed from five different perspectives, each called an order or arrangement. There was a twelve-part and a five-part structure, both present in Ieou, the God of the Middle Light-world, who resides in the center of the universe. Among the five parts, two are exterior, two are interior, and one is the middle order. Each treasure is surrounded by six regions or spaces, represented by diagrams.

By using seals (a series of unique diagrams), numbers, and names, the Guardians, Orders, and Veils disperse, allowing access to the innermost space of the father of the treasure, revealing his true name. Within each treasure, there is a Door or Gate, and outside, there are three Gates. Each outer Gate has three Guardians, but the inner Gate has only one, likely the father of the treasure himself.

After this explanation, the disciples ask how all these spaces and their fatherhoods came into existence. Jesus explains that it is due to the "Little Idea" left by the Father, who withdrew everything else into Himself. "It was from this Little Idea that I emerged, having my being in the Father; I burst forth and freed myself from it. I shone forth and it emanated me, the first emanation, its perfect likeness and image. After emanating me, I stood before it."

This was the First Voice. The Second Voice emanated, creating all these spaces one after another. The Third Voice created the rulers of all these spaces. Jesus, the First Voice and first emanation, gathered His own Order—the Twelve—and led them through all the spaces so they could serve Him. He gave them the power to pass through all these spaces to the innermost space of the ruler of them all, the True God.

The disciples reminded Jesus that He had promised to give them a master-name that would allow them to traverse any space without the need to repeat numerous individual names—a name that would unlock every gate to every treasure. They ask if this is the Great Name of the Father. Christ replied, "No, it is the Name of the Great Power that is in all spaces." He then gave them this name, which appeared to be a coded sentence with the seven vowels repeated three times. This name should be spoken in the Space of the True God, within the "space of the interiors that belongs to the space of the exteriors."

The name must be invoked while facing the four corners of the treasure, followed by a request that all paths to the Father be open to the disciple, "for I have invoked the Great Name of the God of all spaces." When done, all veils will lift, and all rulers will retreat to "their own form." The Master continued, "I have told you the master-name; guard it and do not repeat it constantly, so that all spaces may not be disturbed by its glory."

Jesus then commanded His disciples to follow Him further into the seventh treasure. This seventh treasure does not seem to be part of the sixty treasures but belongs to a different order. Here, He instructed them to surround Him and respond with a threefold "Amen" for each praise, as He sang a hymn of praise to the Father for the emanation of the treasures. The Father was first addressed by the Ineffable Name, then as "God, My Father," and finally as the "Unapproachable One." The beginning of each praise-giving starts with: "I praise You, Unapproachable God, for shining forth in Yourself," and ends with: "What is Your will now, but that all this should be, Unapproachable God?"

The hymn's topic is that God has withdrawn into Himself and His Truth, except for one Little Idea, which He left as the shining Light-world within the Father. This Light is a radiance of the Father, created by His will, and is Jesus, the Father's only emanation. Jesus is the perfect likeness and complete image of God. The second emanation creates the spaces around the Father. The third emanation brings forth the powers and rulers of the Light-spaces, called Treasures. All these powers are energized by a Great Power from the Father, making them True Gods, distinguished from the gods of popular belief.

This Power energizes not only the various fathers of the treasures but also the subordinate powers. It also emanates the Guardians or Watchers and the sixty fatherhoods, one for each treasure, known as the "Orders of the Five Trees." This Power also creates the seals and the great name. It is called the [First?] Mystery and the Light-image surrounding the Father. These Light-spaces are known as the Spaces of the "Great Logoi according to the Mystery," which contain the Father's glory. This suggests that the "Great Logos" mentioned in the treatise is the same as the First Mystery, the Great Power, and therefore identical with Jesus. The Great Logoi are also called Ieou's.

The hymn continues:

> I praise You, O Unapproachable God, for revealing Yourself; You have manifested Your One and Only Mystery. You are unapproachable even for these Divine Words. You remain unapproachable among them, in this Great Word according to the Mystery of Ieou, the father of all Ieou's, which is Yourself. Yet, what is Your one and only will but that we should come closer to You in these Words, O God that none can approach, to whom we have nevertheless drawn near in this Great Word according to the Mystery of Ieou?

I think "Word" here has two meanings. It generally means Reason or Word, but here it seems to also mean Sermon, Discourse, or Teaching. The hymn ends with praises saying the Father has withdrawn or inbreathed Himself entirely into His Universal Form and Idea, leaving the Little Idea as a means to show His boundless Riches, universal Glory, and mighty Mysteries. The Great or Universal Idea and the Little Idea correspond to the ideas of the macrocosm and microcosm in the spiritual world. The hymn ends with a final triple Amen.

The remaining two fragments are in an appendix by Schmidt. The first fragment is part of a hymn of praise, each praise beginning with:

>Listen to me, while I sing Your praises, You Mystery before all Uncontainables and Impassables, who revealed Your Mystery, so that the Mystery from the beginning should be completed.

The hymn includes the following, with imperishable names added after each term:

> The Mystery revealed itself as the Water of the Ocean. The Earth in the middle of the Ocean became purified. The entire substance of the Ocean became purified, including the Sea and all species within it. Through its radiance, it calmed the Sea and everything in it, as their power was in chaos against the natural order.

The hymn abruptly ends, leading to a description of the soul's journey through regions controlled by demonic forces and the use of imperishable names to escape their grasp. These regions are governed by various ministers of the Great Powerful Ruler on the Middle Path. The names of these ministers match those found in the "Books of the Saviour." This Great Powerful Ruler, described as "filled with wrath," succeeds the Ruler of the Outer Darkness, a space that changes all forms. He is positioned on the Middle Path to capture souls like a thief. The pages of these fragments are bordered differently from the rest of the manuscript.

#### Selections from the Untitled Apocalypse of the Codex Brucianus

Selections from the Untitled Apocalypse of the Codex Brucianus start in the middle of a description of divine beings and realms:

> He [the God beyond Being] established Him so that they might strive towards the City where their Image resides. In this City, they exist and live; it is the House of the Father, the Garment of the Son, the Power of the Mother, and the Image of the Fullness (Pleroma). He is the First Father of All; the first Being; the King of the Intangibles. In Him, the All moves. In Him, He gave Form to the All. This is the self-created and self-generated Space; the Depth of the All. He is the Great One, whose true existence is deeper than the Depth. He is the one to whom everything came. Everything was silent before Him and did not speak to Him, because He is beyond description and understanding. He is the first Source; His Voice has spread everywhere. He is the first Tone, through which everything understands. His limbs create countless powers, each originating from them.
>
> The second space came into being, called Demiurge, Father, Logos, Source, Mind, Man, Eternal, and Limitless. This is the Pillar; He is the Overseer. He is also the Father of everything; on His Head, the Aeons form a wreath, shining their rays. His Face is unknowable in the outer Worlds—those Worlds seek His Face, wanting to know it, for His Word has reached them, and they yearn to see Him. The Light of His Eyes reaches the Outer Pleroma, and the Word from His Mouth reaches the Above and Below of the Outer Worlds. The Hair of His Head represents the number of Hidden Worlds, and His Face is the model of the Aeons. The Hairs of His Face represent the number of Outer Worlds, and the spread of His Hands symbolizes the Cross; the Cross spreads ninefold, on the Right and the Left.
>
> The source of the Cross is the Man beyond comprehension. He is the Father; He is the Source of Silence; He is desired in every Space. He is the Father from whom the Monad emerged like a light-spark, compared to which all Worlds are like darkness. The Monad has moved everything with its light. They have received Knowledge, Life, Hope, Peace, Love, Resurrection, Faith, Rebirth, and the Seal."These are the nine aspects that come from the Father, who is both Father and Mother to Himself, and whose Pleroma (fullness) transcends the Twelve Depths.
>
> 1. The first Depth is the Source from which all sources originate.
> 2. The second Depth is Wisdom from which all wisdom originates.
> 3. The third Depth is Mystery from which all mysteries originate.
> 4. The fourth Depth is Knowledge from which all knowledge originates.
> 5. The fifth Depth is Holiness from which all holiness originates.
> 6. The sixth Depth is Silence from which all silence originates.
> 7. The seventh Depth is the Gate without substance, from which all substances originate.
> 8. The eighth Depth is the Forefather from whom all forefathers originate.
> 9. The ninth Depth is the All-father-Self-father, in whom all fathers exist, being their only father.
> 10. The tenth Depth is Power from which all powers originate.
> 11. The eleventh Depth is the First Invisible, from which all invisibles originate.
> 12. The twelfth Depth is Truth from which all truth originates.
>
> This second space, as a Monad, surrounds the Depths and embodies the Truth that encompasses them all. It is the Image of the Father, the Truth of Everything, and the Mother of all Aeons. It surrounds all Depths, is incomprehensible, and contains all Seals without having a Seal itself. It is eternally blessed, the eternal Father, ineffable, unthinkable, incomprehensible, and unsurpassable. In it, all things found joy, rejoiced, and brought forth countless Aeons, known as the 'Births of Joy,' because everything rejoiced with the Father.
>
> These are the worlds from which the Cross emerged; from these spiritual elements, the Man arose. "This is the Father and the Source of Everything, whose parts are gathered together and made complete. All names come from the Father—whether they are called Ineffable, Unknowable, Incomprehensible, Invisible, Unique, Solitary, Power, All-powerful, or names that are only spoken in silence—they all come from the Father, whom all the outer worlds see like stars in the night sky. Just as people wish to see the sun, the outer worlds long to see the Father because of his surrounding invisibility. He gives life to the Aeons forever, and through His Word, the Indivisible has come to understand the Monad; and by His Word, the holy Pleroma came into existence.
>
> This is the Father, the second Creator; through His Breath, Forethought made that-which-does-not-exist. That-which-does-not-exist arose through His will, for He commands everything to come into being. In this way, He created the holy Pleroma: four Gates, each with a Monad, six Supporters for each Gate (totaling twenty-four Supporters), and twenty-four myriads of Powers for each Gate. Additionally, there are nine Groups of Nine for each Gate, ten Groups of Ten for each Gate, twelve Groups of Twelve for each Gate, and five Groups of Five Powers for each Gate, along with an Overseer who has three faces—one that is uncreated, one that is true, and one that is indescribable—for each Gate.
>
> One of his faces looks outside the Gate to the outer Aeons, another looks at Setheus, and the third looks upwards—to the Sonship in each Monad, where Aphredon and his twelve Righteous Ones are above. Above is the Forefather, in that realm is Adam, the Man of Light, with his 365 Aeons, and the Perfect Mind, all surrounding a network that never dies.
>
> The indescribable face of the Overseer looks into the Holy of Holies, the Boundless One, who is the head of the Holy Place. He has two faces; one looks into the Depth and the other towards the Overseer, known as the 'Child.' Within this Depth, called the 'Light' or the 'Shining One,' lies the Alone-born, who reveals three Powers and is mighty in all Powers.
>
> The Alone-born is indivisible and never divided; it is for Him that everything has opened up, for all Powers belong to Him.

These passages, taken in order from the first pages, according to Schmidt's arrangement of the leaves, give the reader some idea of the nature of the unabridged contents of this apocalyptic treatise. For the rest, we must content ourselves with a translation of some of the more intelligible or striking passages.

The original seer seems to have described his vision of the inner spaces from different perspectives in a series of visions. Another writer's comments are interspersed. The first clear instance of this is a passage that was unfortunately damaged by the Coptic translator. The commentator admits the subject is very difficult, if not impossible, to describe with human language; yet he believes no one could succeed better than the original seer or those who spoke through him. These spaces and beings are more extraordinary than human intellectual abilities, so it's impossible for anyone to understand them unless they are fortunate enough to encounter a "kinsman" of those higher beings—a "relative of the mystery"—someone who has learned and experienced these states of consciousness.

Even then, the Mystery of the Father cannot be fully expressed, as even advanced seers like Marsanes and Nicotheus, past seers of the Gnosis, have stated. All the Perfect have seen Him and praised Him to the best of their abilities, but none have successfully revealed Him.

Later, while discussing the "Metropolis of the Alone-begotten," the same writer quotes another Gnostic Master who, upon understanding, said: "Through Him exists That-which-really-is and That-which-really-is-not, allowing the Hidden-which-really-is and the Manifest-which-really-is-not to exist." This quote comes from a Gnostic named Phosilampes, but the ideas are so similar to those of Basilides that it seems Phosilampes might be a pseudonym for this teacher.

A significant part of our treatise focuses on the Logos and His creative powers and self-emanation. For example:

> This is Setheus, who dwells in the Shrine as a King and God. He is the Logos-Creator; He commands everything to function. He is the Creative Mind, following God's command. He is worshiped as God, Lord, and Savior, and everything admires His grace and beauty. The inner universe forms a crown for His head, the outer universe is under His feet, and the middle universe surrounds Him, praising and saying:
>
> "Holy, holy, holy is He, [here follow the seven vowels each repeated three times]. You are the Living One among the living; the Holy One among the holy; Being among beings; Father among the fathers; God among the gods; Lord among the lords; Space among the spaces." They also praise Him by saying: "You are the House and the Dweller in the House." And they address the Son hidden in Him: "You are the Only-begotten, Light, Life, and Grace."

There is an account of the descent of the Light-spark or Light-stream from above, reaching down to matter:

> Then the Veils opened and Light penetrated into Matter below, to those without form or likeness; thus they gained the likeness of the Light. Some rejoiced as they became rich with the Light; others wept, becoming poor as their possessions were taken. Grace came forth, and captivity was taken captive, praising the Aeons who received the Spark within. Guardians were sent to help those who believed in the Light-spark.
>
> This Light-spark is indivisible and led the struggle for the universe. Everything was given to him by the One who is exalted above all. The immeasurable Depth was given to him, along with the countless fatherhoods within."In the realm of existence lies the divine or sacred land.

The beings adorned with this light sing praises to the King, the Only-Begotten, the Logos, saying:

> "Through You, we have gained fame and seen the Father of all, and the Mother of all things hidden everywhere. She is the creator of all ages, gods, and lords; she holds the knowledge of all unseen things. Your image is the mother of all limitless beings and the power of all impassable entities. Through Your image, we saw You, sought refuge in You, stood firm in You, and received the eternal crown known through You. Praise to You forever, O Only-Begotten One. Amen!."

We learn that this being...

> became a body of light and entered the realms of the Indivisible, reaching the Only-Begotten who resides in the Monad (the Father) who dwells in silence alone. His powers received the grace of the Only-Begotten, meaning His goodness, and he received the eternal crown. He (the Logos) is the Father of all light sparks; He is the chief of all immortal bodies; He is the reason resurrection is granted to these immortal bodies...

Higher states of being are described, and we hear of the Perfected One "who received the grace of the Unknowable, and thus a Son-ship that the Pleroma could not endure due to the excess of its light and brilliance within Him."

The Gnostic seer's intuition ascends even higher, speaking of the Logos-Demiurgos...

> ...accompanied by a host of powers with crowns on their heads. Their crowns emit rays; the brilliance of their bodies is like the life of the space they have entered; the word (logos) from their mouths is eternal life. The light that shines from their eyes brings them peace; the movement of their hands connects them to the space from which they came, and looking at their own faces gives them self-knowledge. Returning to themselves repeatedly strengthens them, and reaching out with their hands makes them stable. Hearing with their ears leads to understanding in their hearts, and the unity of their bodies represents the gathering of Israel's scattered people. Their unity fortifies them in the Divine Word.
>
> The complete unity of the Creator-Word with those who emerged from the reordering was achieved. They all became one, as it is written: "They all became one in the One and Only One."
>
> Then the Creator-Word became Divine Power, Lord, Savior, Christ (or Righteous), Good, Father, and Mother. His efforts succeeded, and He was honored and became the Father of believers. He became the Lord and the Mighty One.

In this final accomplishment, everything is ordered anew for the Victor. He is given the first fruits of the Sonship sacrifice, granting Him the power to become thrice-powerful. He received the vow of the Sonship because the universe had been enslaved, and He took on the entrusted struggle. He purified matter and transformed it into a World, an Aeon, and a City, called 'Immortality' and 'Jerusalem.' It is also known as the 'New Earth,' 'Self-sufficing,' and 'Perfect Freedom.' This land is life-giving and divine.

The Wreath and Robe of the glorified are celebrated. This is the Wreath mentioned in the scriptures: 'It was given to Solomon on the day of the joy of his heart.'

> The first Monad sent Him an indescribable garment made entirely of Light, Life, Resurrection, Love, Hope, Faith, Wisdom, Knowledge, Truth, and Peace. The entire universe is within this garment, has discovered itself in it, and has recognized itself through it. The garment provided light to everything, and countless powers were given to it so that it could uplift the universe once and for all.
>
> The Monad gathered its ventures, shaped them like a surrounding veil, poured itself over them, elevated all, and organized everything according to specific orders, laws, and foresight. It separated what exists from what does not exist. What does not exist is the evil manifest in matter. The Vesture-power distinguished the existent from the non-existent, calling the existent 'eternal' and the non-existent 'matter.' It placed veils and purifying powers between them to cleanse and purify.

The future work of the Glorified is further described:

> Countless glories, angels, archangels, and ministers were given to Him to serve Him, including those of matter. Authority over all things was granted to Him, and He created a mighty Aeon for Himself, with a vast Pleroma and a great Sanctuary within it. He placed all the powers He received in this Sanctuary and rejoiced as He brought forth His creatures again, following the command of the hidden Father who sent Him these treasures. The crown of Fatherhood was given to Him, establishing Him as the father of those who followed Him, namely, His disciples.
>
> And He cried out and said: "My children, I am in pain for you until Christ is fully formed in you." He also said: "Indeed, I would place a holy virgin with Christ as her only husband."
>
> When He saw the Grace the hidden Father had given Him, He wanted to lead everything back to the hidden Father, because it is the Father's will that everything should return to Him.
>
> Those who repented left behind the material world and ascended to the realm of the One who is Father to Himself alone. They took a vow, as stated by Him: "Whoever has forsaken father, mother, brother, sister, wife, child, and possessions, and takes up their cross and follows Me, will receive the promises I have made. I will give them the mystery of the hidden Father, for they have loved what is His and have fled from those who pursued them with force."
>
> So He gave them Glory, Joy, Jubilation, Gladness, Peace, Hope, Faith, Love, and Eternal Truth. These are the nine gifts given to those who have left the material world. They have become blessed and perfect, recognized the True God, and understood the mystery given to humanity. For this reason, He revealed Himself so they could see Him, even though He is truly invisible. For their benefit, He revealed His Word, so they might know Him and become divine and perfect.

Speaking of the First-born and His glories, the spiritual powers of His cosmic vesture are described again:

> They gave Him a Vesture to complete everything in Him."In it are all bodies: the body of fire, water, ether, earth, air, angels, archangels, powers, mighty ones, gods, and lords. In short, all bodies are in it, so nothing can stop Him from moving up and down to the underworld.
>
> He is the First-born, promised everything by the Inner and the Outer. He separated all matter and spread Himself over it, like a hen over her chicks. The First-born prepared matter and created countless species and kinds. As the matter warmed, it released His multitude of powers, which grew like plants and were categorized by kind and species. He gave them the law: to love one another, honor God, praise Him, seek Him, and wonder about their origin, which is narrow and difficult, and not to return there but to follow Him who gave them the law.
>
> He lifted them from the darkness of matter, their mother, and taught them about Light, which they hadn't known existed. He commanded them not to harm one another and left to join the Mother of the universe beside the Father, so they could give laws to those who emerged from matter.

The Mother's powers sing a hymn to the Son, praising the One and Only, saying:

> You alone are the Boundless; You alone the Depth; You alone the Unknowable; You are He whom all seek but cannot find without help, for no one can know You against Your will, and no one can praise You against Your will. Your will alone created space for You, as no one can contain You, for You are the space of all. I pray that You give guidance to the people of the world and directions to my offspring according to Your will. Do not grieve my offspring, as no one is ever grieved by You; yet no one has ever fully understood Your plans. You are the one whom everyone, both inner and outer beings, relies on, for You alone are uncontainable, beyond all vision, and beyond all substance. You alone have given distinct characteristics to all creatures and revealed them in Yourself.
>
> You are also the Creator of those things that have not yet appeared. Only You know them; we do not. You alone reveal them to us so that we may pray to You for the sake of Mother Sophia to bring them forth, for we can only know them through You. You have elevated Yourself to the realm of hidden worlds so that they might know You; it is You who have allowed them to know You, bringing them to life in Your incorporeal body, and teaching them.
>
> You have begotten the Man in Your self-born Mind, reflecting and conceiving him. He is the Man born of Mind, shaped by Reflection. You have given everything to the Man. He wears them like garments, enveloping Himself with creation as with a mantle. This is the Man whom the universe seeks to know.
>
> You alone have commanded the Man to reveal himself so that You may be known through him, as You created him. You have revealed Yourself according to Your will. You are the one to whom I pray, Father of all fatherhood, God of all gods, Lord of lords. I implore You to guide my forms and offspring, so that I may prepare joy for them in Your name and power.

The hymn becomes confusing as the mystic identifies himself with Sophia.

> One and Only King, who never changes, give me power so I can help my children know You as their Savior.

The infinite Light descends upon Sophia, completing the world’s order in the grand drama and purifying the soul.

> The Lord of Splendor descended and separated matter into two parts and two regions, giving each clear boundaries. Those who fled to Him worshipped Him, and He placed them at His right side, granting them eternal life. He called the right side the 'Place of Life' and the left the 'Place of Death'; the right the 'Place of Light' and the left the 'Place of Darkness'; the right the 'Place of Rest' and the left the 'Place of Suffering.'
>
> He created boundaries and veils between them so they could not see each other and placed guards at the veils. He honored those who worshipped Him and exalted them above those who resisted Him. He expanded the right side into countless spaces, creating many orders, aeons, worlds, heavens, firmaments, regions, and places, and set laws and regulations for them.
>
> 'Stay true to My word, and I will grant you eternal life, send you powers, and strengthen you with spirits of power. You will have the authority to do as you wish, without hindrance. You will create aeons, worlds, and heavens so that spirits born of the mind can dwell there. You will be gods, knowing you come from God, and you will see that He is within you, dwelling in your aeon.'
>
> The Lord of the universe spoke these words to them and then disappeared from their sight, hiding Himself. The elements of creation rejoiced that they had been remembered and were happy to have escaped their narrow and difficult confines and prayed to the hidden Mystery:
>
> Grant us the authority to create our own aeons and worlds, as You promised Your servant. For You alone are unchanging, boundless, self-conceived, self-born, and self-fathered. You alone are unshakeable and unknowable. You alone embody silence, love, and the source of all. You alone are pure and spotless matter, with a lineage no one can trace and a manifestation no one can comprehend.
>
> Hear me, Father imperishable, Father immortal, God of the hidden worlds, You who are the only Light and Life, the invisible, ineffable, unstainable, and invincible one. You existed before everything else. Hear our prayer to the One hidden everywhere. Send us spirits to dwell with us and teach us what You have promised. Let them live within us, making us their vessels, as is Your will. Establish law and order in our work according to Your will and the statutes of the hidden aeons. Guide us, for we belong to You.

In response to this prayer, it is described how the mysteries (such as those of baptism and others) were given to those who repented. These mysteries involve stages of purification, allowing individuals to ascend to higher levels of consciousness through the purity of their inner selves, corresponding to certain states or regions.

> He listened to them and sent forth separating powers that understand the statutes of the hidden aeons. He sent them out as instructed by the hidden ones and established orders based on the hierarchy and hidden laws. They started building from the ground up to ensure everything was properly constructed.
>
> He created the air-world as a resting place for those who had emerged from matter, so they could stay there until those below them were established. After that, the true dwelling place, the place of repentance, and the aetherial reflections of the mansions of the Inheritance followed. Within these are the self-born reflections. There, they baptize themselves in the Name of the Self-born, who is their God, and powers are established beside the spring of the Water of Life.
>
> Within these realms are the Pistis Sophia and the preexisting and aetherial Jesus with his twelve aeons."

The names of the powers in the last two spaces are given, but unfortunately, there is a gap in the manuscript, and the following pages are damaged in many places.

Still, higher and higher spaces are described as the purified souls ascend the Great Ladder. The Heavenly Man, and the Lord of the Pleroma, is praised:

> The Father has sealed Him as His Son within them, so they would know Him internally. And the Name moved them within, so they saw the Invisible Unknowable. And they praised the One and Only One, Conception, and the Mind-born Logos, praising the three, who are one, for through Him they became supersubstantial.
>
> The Father took their whole likeness and made it into a City or a Man; He shaped the universe in His likeness—that is, all these powers. Each one of them knew Him in this City; all began to sing countless songs of praise of the Man or the City of the Father of the universe. And the Father has taken his glory and made it into a garment for the Man. He formed his body in the likeness of the holy Pleroma.

Next follows the complete description of the Limbs of the Heavenly Man. The rest of the manuscript contains a Hymn to the Light, quoted from another Gnostic hymn-writer, introduced by the words "he says," and continues as follows:

> I praise You, Father of all fathers of the Light; I praise You, boundless Light more excellent than all the boundless ones; I praise You, uncontainable Light surpassing all uncontainables; I praise You, ineffable Light, before all ineffables.

The hymn continues with many praises, often of great beauty, until the manuscript abruptly ends in the middle of a sentence.

#### Notes on the Contents of the Bruce and Askew Codices

The attentive reader will have already noticed that the contents of the Pistis Sophia treatise, the Extracts from The Books of the Saviour, and the fragments titled The Book of the Great Logos according to the Mystery, are closely related; they clearly belong to the same school. The results of Schmidt's research into this interesting question are most evident in his response to Preuschen's criticism of his work, a copy of which Schmidt kindly sent me. (See Zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche Theologie, Part IV, 1894.)

Schmidt summarizes his findings, combining the results of his research. If I may offer a general opinion on this complex subject, I would say that all three compilations we are considering belong not only to the same school but also to the same effort at synthesis and reformulation. It is evident that each contains older materials, and it is almost certain that the writer of the Pistis Sophia was familiar with the material of the Extracts of Ieou and Baptism expositions. The more challenging question is the relationship between the Extracts and The Book of the Great Logos, and the most difficult question is determining the school and authors to which they belong.

So far, the only thing certain about their date is that the compilers of these documents had access to the same sayings as those who compiled the Canonical Gospels. This suggests they were created around the end of the first quarter of the second century. However, the unusual phrase used to introduce a quote from the Pauline Letters ("Thou didst say unto us aforetime by the mouth of Paul our brother") shows such a disregard for the Canonical Acts that it suggests an earlier date.

Some have dated the documents to the third century due to their complex nature, but I don't find this convincing. When we consider the complicated nature of the newly discovered pre-Irenaean Gnostic work and the highly complex content of the superior untitled manuscript of the Codex Brucianus, which Schmidt places in the second century, an earlier date seems more likely. Some materials are undoubtedly very old, but the compilation is our main concern.

I believe all three were compiled by the same group or even by the same writer, though some might find this hypothesis risky. It's clear that these treatises belong to the core of Gnosticism, familiar with its inner traditions, secret documents, and practical experiences. Whether you call this stream of Gnosticism "Ophite," "Barbelo-Gnostic," "Gnostic," or "Valentinian" doesn't matter much to the compiler or compilers of these documents.

It is evident that the Extracts and part of The Book of the Great Logos are both based on the same original source. The text of the Baptism extract in the Askew Codex is slightly different from the same rite in the Bruce Codex. This is likely because they were translated by different people who took liberties with their versions and often struggled to translate Greek into Coptic, as seen in many passages.

A certain reformulated version of Gnosis is referred to as The Books of the Saviour or The Book of the Great Logos. The original Greek documents may not have had titles, and these were likely added by the copiers or Coptic translators and scribes.

The Pistis Sophia mentions a work called The Two Books of Ieou, stating they were given by the Saviour to Enoch and preserved from the Flood. If these references in the Pistis Sophia are genuine, The Two Books of Ieou cannot be the same as the common document in the Extracts and The Book of the Great Logos. Instead, this document was likely a reworking of the Books of Ieou.

The Books of Ieou probably belonged to an ancient tradition, likely Egyptian, containing many symbols, seals, passwords, and mystery names. These traditions were associated with the pre-Flood Egypt ("the Egypt of the First Hermes or Agathodaemon") and were linked with Semitic traditions by Jewish and Christian Gnostic groups. I have discussed this in detail in my work on the Trismegistic literature.

Therefore, I believe the common document in the Extracts and The Book of the Great Logos was not the actual Books of Ieou mentioned in the Pistis Sophia. Instead, it contained the essence of the Ieou Books, transformed by a Gnostic writer into a new form. I also suggest that this writer was the same person who authored the Pistis Sophia, who reformulated the Books of Ieou based on the Gnosis of the Living Master.

These things do not appear to have been done in order; they were likely various attempts at creating a consistent synthesis of old wisdom, attempts that probably did not satisfy the writer. They seem to be the results of a lifetime of work and may have been revised or reworked several times. Who can say for sure given our current lack of historical data? And if we ask: Who could have made such an attempt? I see no other candidate among known Gnostic writers than Valentinus. However, proving this conclusively seems unlikely, as we know very little about him and his writings; we only know of his great reputation and his attempt to reformulate Gnosis. In fact, what we call Valentinianism doesn’t help us in this speculation at all.

According to the Church Fathers, "they of Valentinus" seem to have formulated their ideas somewhat differently, and their contributions form only a small part of the larger syntheses we are examining. However, the information from the Church Fathers is very incomplete, and they mostly dealt with the more popular aspects of Gnosticism. The complex subjects and inner teachings in our Codices could not have been circulated publicly; they were meant for "disciples." Although the Pistis contains more popular content in parts, if it had been widely circulated, it is odd that no mention of such an extraordinary exposition remains. I put forward this speculation cautiously; it suggests a completely different understanding of Valentinianism, an internal rather than external view.

Our understanding of Gnosticism has been revised frequently with new discoveries, so we can still hope that some new find will shed light on this currently obscure problem. In the introduction to my translation of the Pistis Sophia, I realize I previously expressed my conclusions more bluntly than I would now. So, as I repeat my thoughts on the probable history of the Askew Codex, I will refine some of my statements.

The original Greek work known as Pistis Sophia was likely compiled by Valentinus in the latter half of the second century, possibly in Alexandria. By "compiled," I mean that Valentinus did not create this Apocalypse or Gospel entirely from scratch. Instead, he structured the narrative, selected texts and ideas from various scriptures (Hebrew, Christian, Egyptian, Chaldaean, Greek, etc.), and adapted the terminology.

Several copies of this original work were likely made, and errors may have crept in. One of these copies was probably taken up the Nile and translated into the local language since Greek was not widely understood there. The translator was not very accurate and had limited knowledge of the subject, leaving many technical terms in the original language and likely guessing at others. Additionally, some content might have been added or removed to align with orthodox beliefs. For instance, the lengthy Psalms that Pistis Sophia recites in her repentances, followed by the shorter Salomonic Odes, suggest that the compiler originally cited only a few significant verses from each psalm.

The later, more orthodox translator, with a penchant for repetitive piety typical of monks both in the East and the West, probably added the less relevant verses he was familiar with. However, he had to leave the Salomonic Odes as they were due to his unfamiliarity with the originals. The translator must have translated or had a translation of other similar documents, which he or a later scribe called The Books of the Saviour. From these, he took what he thought were relevant passages and added them to the Pistis translation.

I believe these Books also came from the literary workshop of Valentinus. The entire manuscript of the Coptic translator seems to have been copied by an unskilled copyist who made many spelling mistakes. It was copied hurriedly by one person, and I suggest that two copies were made, with pages from one copy sometimes replacing pages from the other. Since the pages were not identical in wording, this could explain some confusing repetitions and gaps. This copy was likely made towards the end of the fourth century.

The history of the manuscript after this date is impossible to guess. However, it must have had an interesting journey to escape destruction by both Christian and Muslim fanatics, and during this time, some pages were lost. The contents of the inferior manuscript of the Bruce Codex probably had similar adventures and may have come from the same Coptic center.

In these brief sketches, it would be out of place to conduct a detailed investigation into the nature of the aeonology, cosmology, soteriology, christology, and eschatology of these documents or to trace their changes. The evolution of the universe follows a certain order, but its involution seems to change that order; the soteriology affects the aeonology and cosmology.

In my opinion, this is why the scheme underlying the Extracts and The Book of the Great Logos is considered an "older form" than that underlying the Pistis treatise. The structure behind the Pistis Sophia has been thoroughly analyzed by Kostlin and later revised and corrected by Schmidt. Schmidt also tried to trace changes in the general structure underlying the Extracts (previously mistaken for the Fourth Book of Pistis Sophia) and The Book of the Great Logos, as well as the structure assumed in the Pistis Sophia. These changes were prompted by new revelations about the three Spaces of the Inheritance in the final treatise.

To help the reader, we present the general outline of the scheme in the Pistis Sophia, but note that it represents just one version of the cosmic mystery at a specific time or phase of consciousness.

1. The Ineffable:
   - The Limbs of the Ineffable.

2. The Highest Light-world, or The Kingdom of Light:
   - The First Space of the Ineffable.
   - The Second Space of the Ineffable (or the First Space of the First Mystery).
   - The Second Space of the First Mystery.

3. The Higher (or Middle) Light-world:
   - The Treasure of Light.
   - The Place of the Right.
   - The Place of the Midst.

4. The Lower Light- or Aeon-world (a mix of Light and Matter):
   - The Place of the Left:
     1. The Thirteenth Aeon.
     2. The Twelve Aeons.
     3. Fate.
     4. The Sphere.
     5. The Rulers of the Ways of the Midst.
     6. The Lower Firmament.
   - The World of Men.
   - The Under-world:
     1. Amenti.
     2. Chaos.
     3. Outer Darkness.

Now, let's briefly consider the superior manuscript of the Bruce Codex. We should avoid trying to explain the system assumed by its compiler(s), despite Schmidt's high opinion and appreciation expressed in his Introduction (pp. 34 and 35):

> What a different world we encounter in our thirty-one leaves! We find ourselves in the pure realms of the highest Pleroma, witnessing the creation of a world rich with heavenly beings. Each space and its inhabitants are described in detail, allowing us to vividly picture the glory and splendor of this Gnostic heaven. Unlike the confusing and fantastical speculations in Pistis Sophia and the two Books of Jeu, everything here is harmonious and logically ordered. The author, deeply influenced by Greek philosophy and the Platonic ideas, views the origin of evil as Matter (Hyle), in line with Plato's beliefs. In this work, it is not Christ who communicates with the disciples, nor Jesus who is God's messenger and redeemer. Instead, we have a brilliantly conceived piece by an ancient Gnostic philosopher, whose bold speculations and rich thoughts leave us astonished and moved.
>
> This work is not a product of declining Gnosticism like Pistis Sophia. It comes from a time when Gnostic genius soared like a mighty eagle, moving towards pure light and knowledge, losing itself in ecstasy. In short, this Gnostic work is of great importance, taking us to a period of Gnosticism, and therefore Christianity, of which we know very little.

While we agree with Schmidt's high appreciation of the content's sublimity, we must differ with him regarding the clarity and logical order of the contents as they are currently preserved. If everything is so clear and logically ordered, it's surprising that Schmidt hasn't tried to explain the content. I've spent many hours puzzling over his translation, trying to make sense of it, but I've always failed. However, my study has led me to disagree with Schmidt’s belief that the work is by a single author.

My current, tentative conclusion is that the original material was an apocalypse—a series of visions about the inner workings of things. These visions weren't in a specific order but were recorded at different times as the seer described nature from various perspectives. The original writer seemed to follow the Basilidian Gnosis, using its teachings and terms. Yet, he had his own insights and, inspired by what he saw, he described greater things by comparing them to the lesser, yet still glorious, things he could express.

These apocalyptic visions were later expanded, annotated, and unified by a knowledgeable writer familiar with Gnostic literature and who had personal experiences of these visions. This writer tried to create a consistent work from the apocalyptic material, which he highly valued, but often failed. He acknowledged that it's impossible for any human language to fully describe such profound mysteries.

I believe that this later author's work belongs to the same literary circle we've been discussing. In this passage, we have another example of efforts to revise and synthesize Gnostic teachings, with the main attempt linked to the work of Valentinus. The story of the Greek original is likely similar to that of the Pistis Sophia original. It was probably translated around the same time and had similar experiences.

#### The Akhmim Codex

We now present our readers with the limited information currently available about the latest discovery in Gnosticism. Ten years ago, Dr. Carl Schmidt told me he hoped to publish a work on the subject, including a text and translation, in about two years. Unfortunately, his much-anticipated work has not yet been published. We are, therefore, entirely reliant on the report he made to the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences, published in their Transactions and dated July 16th, 1896.

Schmidt's communication, titled "A Pre-Irenaeic Gnostic Original Work in Coptic," highlights the immense importance of this discovery. His paper is highly technical and scholarly, but the following summary provides a general idea of a topic currently of interest to a limited number of specialists but should, in time, be familiar to all serious students of Christian theosophy.

In January 1896, Dr. Rheinhardt acquired this valuable papyrus manuscript in Cairo from an antiquities dealer from Akhmim. The dealer claimed it was discovered by a local worker in a niche in a wall. The manuscript is now in the Berlin Egyptian Museum, with each leaf carefully protected with glass. Unfortunately, the manuscript is incomplete; it originally had seventy-one pages, but six are now missing. Each page has about eighteen to twenty-two lines. The writing is exceptionally beautiful, suggesting it dates back to the fifth century.

After a brief preface, the manuscript is titled "Gospel according to Mary," and on page 77, it is labeled "Apocryphon of John." On the same page, it is also titled "Wisdom of Jesus Christ," and on page 128, the same title appears. The next page starts without a title, but at the end of the manuscript, it is labeled "Acts of Peter." Therefore, the manuscript contains three distinct works: "The Gospel of Mary" and "The Apocryphon of John" being the same piece.

The first work begins with:

> One day, when John, the brother of James—the sons of Zebedee—went up to the temple, a Pharisee named Ananias approached him and asked, 'Where is your Master, that you do not follow him?' John replied, 'He has gone back to where He came from.' The Pharisee said, 'The Nazarene has deceived you and led you away from the traditions of your ancestors.' Hearing this, I left the temple for the mountain, feeling very sorrowful, and wondered, 'Why was the Savior chosen, why was He sent to the world by His Father, who is His Father, and what is the nature of the place we are destined to go?'

While he is deep in thought, the heavens open, and the Lord appears to him and the disciples to address his doubts. The Savior then leaves them, and they are again sorrowful and weep. They ask, "How can we go to the heathen and preach the gospel of the kingdom of the Son of Man? If they did not receive Him, how will they receive us?"

Mary stood up, hugged everyone, and spoke to her brothers: "Don't cry or be sad, and don't doubt. His grace will be with you all and will protect you. Let's praise His goodness because He has prepared us and made us human." Peter asked her to share what the Lord had revealed to her, recognizing the special honor the Lord had always given her above all women.

Mary then began to recount a vision of the Lord in a dream. Unfortunately, some pages of the text are missing at this point. As soon as she finished, Andrew stood up and said he couldn't believe the Lord had given such new teachings. Peter also doubted her testimony and criticized her. Mary, in tears, asked Peter, "Peter, what do you think? Do you believe I made this up or lied about the Lord?"

Levi then stepped in to support Mary and scolded Peter for always arguing. Due to missing pages, the continuation of this dispute is unclear. On page 21, a new episode starts and continues uninterrupted until the end of the first treatise. The Lord appeared again to John, and John immediately went to his fellow disciples to share what the Savior had revealed to him.

Schmidt suggests that the original title was The Apocalypse or Revelation, not The Apocryphon of John. The book of the Wisdom of Jesus Christ starts with:

> After His resurrection from the dead, His twelve disciples and seven women disciples went to Galilee to the mountain because they were uncertain about the nature of the All and the mysteries and holy order. Then the Savior appeared to them, not in His previous form but as an invisible spirit. His form was like a great angel of light, His essence indescribable. He wasn't clothed in mortal flesh, but in pure, perfect flesh, as He taught us on the mountain in Galilee which was called...
>
> He said, "Peace be unto you; My peace I give unto you." They were all astonished and afraid.

The Lord told them to ask Him their questions, and each disciple brought forward their doubts and received answers.

The Acts of Peter are also Gnostic in origin and part of the apocryphal stories of the Apostles. This document describes one of Peter's healing miracles. The significance of the manuscript is that it preserves three previously unknown Gnostic writings and provides us with a text known to Irenaeus, a key early authority on Gnosticism.

Irenaeus begins the last section of his first book with the words: "And besides these, from those we previously mentioned as followers of Simon, many Barbelo-Gnostics have emerged, appearing like mushrooms from the ground." In chapter 29, he mainly discusses a group of Barbelo-Gnostics and the teachings found in one of their books, which is not mentioned by other heresiarchs.

Theodoret, another refuter, only knows of this teaching because he copied Irenaeus. This source is our Gospel of Mary, and we can now verify Irenaeus' account point by point, showing how difficult it was for him to accurately reproduce the complex Gnostic systems. Irenaeus starts his exposition with:

> Some of them believe in an eternal Aeon in a Virginal Spirit, whom they call Barbelo, where there is an unnameable Father.

In this new document, the "Father of All" is described as the Invisible, Pure Light that cannot be seen with mortal eyes, and as Spirit, which no one can comprehend. He is Everlasting, Unspeakable, and Unnameable, since no one existed before Him to give Him a name. It is said:

> He thinks of His Image alone and sees it in the Water of Pure Light surrounding Him. His Thought came to life, revealing herself, and stood before Him in the Light-spark; this is the Power that existed before everything else. This Power revealed itself, being the perfect Forethought of all things; the Light, the Likeness of the Light, the Image of the Invisible; the perfect Power, Barbelo, the Aeon perfect in glory—glorifying Him because she manifested herself in Him and thinks of Him. She is the first Thought, His Image; she becomes the First Human; the Virginal Spirit, the one with triple power, triple names, and triple birth; the Aeon that does not age, the Man-woman, who came forth from His Forethought.

According to this, the "Father of All" is at the top of the system, the "Invisible." After Him comes His "Image," which is Barbelo, the "perfect Power," and the "unageing Aeon" mentioned by Irenaeus. By thinking of His Image, His Thought reveals herself in the Light-spark, which is Barbelo. Irenaeus summarizes this briefly and abstractly: "He desired to reveal Himself to Barbelo. Thought emerged and stood before Him, asking for Foreknowledge."

Our text continues: "Barbelo asked Him for Foreknowledge. He nodded, and when He did, Foreknowledge appeared and stood with Thought, which is Forethought, and they glorified the Invisible and the perfect Power, Barbelo, because through her, Foreknowledge came into existence."

Again, this power asked for incorruptibility to be given to her. He nodded, and when He did, incorruptibility appeared and stood with Thought and Foreknowledge, praising the Invisible One and Barbelo, because she existed thanks to them.

For their sake, she asked for everlasting life to be given to them. He nodded again, and everlasting life appeared. They stood and praised Him and Barbelo, because they existed through her and the Invisible Spirit's manifestation.

This group is called the pentad of the Aeons of the Father, which includes the First Man, the Image of the Invisible, Barbelo, Thought, Foreknowledge, Incorruptibility, and Everlasting Life.

At Barbelo's request, the Invisible One brought forth three additional feminine Aeons after Thought:

> Foreknowledge, Incorruptibility, and then Everlasting Life. Barbelo rejoiced in them and, pleased with her creation, generated a Light similar to herself. This Light is said to be the beginning of enlightenment and creation of all things. The Father, seeing this Light, anointed it with His goodness to perfect it, and this is identified as Christ.

Irenaeus likely referred to the passage stating:

> He is the decad of the Aeons, the Father of the unbegotten Father. Barbelo gazed into Him and gave birth to a blessed Light-spark, similar in greatness. This is the Only-begotten, who manifested in the Father, the self-generated God, the first-born Son of the All, the pure Light-spirit.
>
> The Invisible Spirit was delighted with the Light, which had come into existence and first appeared in the first Power—His Forethought—in Barbelo. He blessed the Light with His goodness to make it perfect.

This Only-begotten is the same as the Light or Christ. Irenaeus doesn't explain this clearly, and later he only mentions: "Therefore the First Angel, who stands near the Only-begotten," etc. The Only-begotten asks for Mind to be given to him; once he receives it, he praises the Father and Barbelo as Mind.

Irenaeus continues: "And this, they say, is Christ, who again requests Mind to help him; and then Mind appears; and after this, the Father sends forth the Word."

Here, Irenaeus misses a step and forgets the third male Aeon, Will. Our manuscript provides the following:

> The Invisible Spirit wanted to act. His Will acted and revealed itself, standing with the Mind and the Light, praising Him. The Word followed the Will, as through the Word, Christ created everything.

This separates the upper Ogdoad from the Decad, the lower aeon coming from separate pairs. Next, we have the Self-begotten from Thought, the Word, of whom it is written:

> He has been greatly honored because he came from His first Thought. The Invisible has set him as God over everything. The True God gave him all powers and made the Truth within him subject to him, so that he could understand everything.

Irenaeus summarizes this as:

> Then later, from Mind and the Word, they say, the Self-begotten was sent to represent the Great Light. He was highly honored, and everything was made subject to him. Truth was also sent with him, joining with the Self-begotten and Truth.

Currently, it is impossible to analyze the system from the given fragments. However, it is suggested that the treatise reveals three core phases of the Pleroma, or ideal world: (a) the In-generable, (b) the Self-generable, and (c) the Generable—representing the Father, the Logos, and the All. The Gnosis is a more intricate system than any other known, with limitless idealistic insights into primal processes.

From the Light of Christ and Incorruptibility, four great Lights emerge to surround the Self-begotten. They are named Harmozel, Oroiael, Daveithe, and Eleleth. Additionally, from Will and Everlasting Life, four others arise: Charis, Synesis, Aisthesis, and Phronesis. Irenaeus writes:

> And from the Light which is Christ, and Incorruptibility, four Luminaries were sent forth to surround the Self-begotten; and from Will and Life Everlasting, four emanations were sent forth to serve under the four Luminaries. They call these Grace (Charis), Free-will (Thelesis), Understanding (Synesis), and Prudence (Phronesis). Grace was paired with the first Luminary, which they consider to be the Saviour and call Harmogen; Thelesis with the second, named Raguel; Synesis with the third, named David; and Phronesis with the fourth, named Eleleth.

This passage provides important information. We learn the correct names and see that three of them (Eleleth, Daveithe, Oroiael) are also in the Codex Brucianus. This links the Codex with the first piece in our manuscript. These proofs are enough to establish that The Gospel of Mary was written before A.D. 180, and that the Greek original, from which the Coptic translation was made, predates Irenaeus.

Dr. Schmidt believes the work originated in Egypt. The school that used it was the same one Irenaeus referred to as the Barbelo-Gnostics, or simply the Gnostics. This school was further divided into many smaller groups, whose names and teachings Epiphanius detailed. Among them, many books were circulated under the name of Mary. Epiphanius mentions works like "The Questions of Mary" (both "The Great" and "The Little") and "The Genealogy of Mary." Celsus also encountered this school and might have known our work, mentioning that some heretics trace their origins to Mary and Martha, and he references the well-known diagram of the Ophites.

Our original work shows that Irenaeus copied from it only up to a certain point; then, in another section, he used a second work from the same school that he had found. Dr. Schmidt has shared this interesting information, followed by a note from Professor Harnack. Harnack states:

> This discovery is crucial for early Church history. Not only do we have one (or perhaps three) original Gnostic works from the second century—could 'The Wisdom of Jesus Christ' be the famous work of Valentinus?—but it also shows that Irenaeus quoted from one of the three treatises. For the first time, we can compare the original Gnostic system with the Church Father’s interpretation. The examination reveals that, due to omissions and a lack of effort to understand their opponents, the Church Father distorted the Gnostics' complex speculations.
>
> Another fact, which is very hard to uncover from the writings of their opponents, is that the Gnostic system involves a psychological process within the first principle that the Gnostics wanted to explain. Tertullian mentions once (Adv. Valent., iv.) that 'Ptolemaeus, a student of Valentinus, turned the names and numbers of the aeons into personified substances, external to the deity, whereas Valentinus himself included these within the highest part of the godhead as impressions of sensation and feeling.' However, which of the Church Fathers has taken the time to truly understand the speculations of Valentinus and the other Gnostics?
>
> According to Hippolytus (Philos., vi. 42), the followers of the Gnostic Marcus complained about the misrepresentation of their teachings by Irenaeus; the followers of our newly discovered book could also have complained about the confusing way Irenaeus represented their teachings. Previously, we only knew of a Gnostic work, likely from Egypt in the second century, through a summary by a Gallic bishop around the year 185. Now, we have found it again in a Coptic translation from the fifth century, an unusual method of transmission!

If the last chapters of Book I of Irenaeus are copied from the lost Syntagma of Justin or some other earlier work, as top critics have suggested, then the original document is much older than the dates given by Schmidt or Harnack in the above Transaction.

Any student of Gnosticism will immediately realize that the significance of this new find cannot be overstated. The new documents shed light not only on the Codex Brucianus but also on the Pistis Sophia system. We now have three key sources to base our study of Gnostic theosophy on, and there is hope that we can finally clarify the ideas of the best Gnostic thinkers, which have been obscured and overshadowed by biased criticism.

The task for a dedicated student is to find suitable terms for Gnostic concepts, organize the ideas correctly, and demonstrate that the Gnostic approach to understanding the universe and human origins can be just as valid as modern scientific methods, which look at these problems from a different perspective. It's important to remember that figures like Valentinus were theosophists, working on similar studies as their contemporaries worldwide. Major cosmological theories share similarities with Gnostic cosmogenesis, and studying these can reveal their common origins. Gnostic views on human origins have much in common with general theosophical ideas, and recent research supports many aspects of Gnostic psychology.

Gnostic terms are not more difficult to understand than those used by other theosophical writers. There is a clear parallel between how different Gnostic writers use these terms and how the Church Fathers misunderstood and misrepresented Gnostic views, similar to how other theosophical writers have been treated by their critics. Both Gnostics and the Church Fathers contributed to the confusion and misrepresentation.

In summary, we should apply the same critical standards to Gnostic writings as we do to all similar literature. Today, we openly discuss many topics that the Gnostics expressed through symbols and myths. However, our actual understanding of these subjects isn't significantly more advanced than that of the Gnostic scholars. Back then, as now, only a few truly understand what they are writing about; the majority simply copy, compare, adapt, and speculate.

#### Some Forgotten Sayings

In the early centuries of Christianity, there were many traditions, legends, and religious stories in circulation, known as Memoirs, Acts, and Gospels. These contained sayings of the Lord, or Logoi, which were prophetic statements similar to those made by members of the Schools of the Prophets in the Old Testament.

Over time, some of these traditional and legendary settings of the Logoi were declared to be historical, and a canon of orthodox tradition was established from the mid-second century onwards. The term "mythical" here refers to stories that symbolically convey teachings about the nature of God, the universe, and the human soul.

As only a few writings were selected for the canon, many Logoi were rejected. The latest collection of these excluded Logoi was made by Resell and published in 1889 in Gebhardt and Harnack's series "Texte und Untersuchungen," under the title "Agrapha: Aussercanonische Evangelienfragmente."

Some of these non-canonical fragments are variations of familiar canonical sayings, mainly interesting for reconstructing one of the original sources the synoptic compilers used. A few are found in the Pauline Letters, while others are entirely unfamiliar to those who only know the canonical books of the New Testament. These sayings are particularly interesting to students of early Christian origins, so I have included a selection translated from Resch's text. Some of these sayings were also included in a religious novel by a Jewish writer, titled "As Others Saw Him," published in 1895 in London by William Heinemann.

Be merciful to receive mercy; forgive so that you may be forgiven; as you do, it will be done to you; as you give, it will be given to you; as you judge, you will be judged; as you serve, service will be done to you; with the measure you use, it will be measured to you in return.

Wisdom sends forth her children.

He who is near Me is near the fire; and he who is far from Me is far from the kingdom.

If you do not observe the small mysteries, who will give you the great ones?

Those who wish to see Me and reach My kingdom must attain Me through pain and suffering.

Good must come, but blessed is he through whom it comes; similarly, evil must come, but woe to him through whom it comes.

The weak will be saved by the strong.

Guard the mysteries for Me and for the sons of My house.

Attach yourself to the holy ones, for those who do so are made holy.

The form of this world passes away.

(Form, meaning configuration, as there are other worlds and other phases of this world). As often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, proclaim My death and confess My resurrection and ascension until I come to you.

Remember to have faith and hope, as they inspire love for God and others, which leads to eternal life.

There are ways of mixing that result in death and others that lead to life.

Seeing a man working on the Sabbath, He said: "Man, if you know what you are doing, you are blessed; but if you do not know, you are cursed and breaking the law."

Why are you amazed by the miracles? I offer you a great inheritance that the entire world cannot hold.

When asked by a man when His kingdom would come, the Lord replied: "When two become one, and the outside is like the inside, and the male is with the female, neither male nor female.

Do not call anyone 'Father' on earth, for there are only rulers on earth; in heaven is the Father from whom all descent comes, both in heaven and on earth.

Do not sadden the Holy Spirit within you, and do not extinguish the Light that shines in you.

As you see your reflection in water or a mirror, see Me in yourselves.

There are false Christs and false teachers who have blasphemed the Spirit of Grace and rejected its gift; they will not be forgiven in this age or the age to come.

Grace is the divine power from above, the power of the Logos that transforms a person into a "christ." Grace, or Charis, is the companion of the Logos, representing his power or shakti. False "christs" are those who have been initiated but have broken their vows. An aeon is a specific period of time.

God desires the repentance of sinners rather than their punishment.

God wishes for everyone to receive His gifts.

Those who have wondered will rule, and those who have ruled will find rest.

[This is a dark saying; it has been compared to a phrase from Plato: "There is no other beginning of philosophy than wondering"--that is to say, regarding the works of the Deity with wonder and reverence. This is the beginning of philosophy, or gnosis, and the end of it makes the man king of himself, and thus master of gods and men; thus is he at peace.]

My mother, the Holy Spirit, recently took me by a single hair of my head and carried me to the great mountain Tabor.

[This might symbolize the soul’s journey to the spiritual realm.]

Those who seek me will find me in children from age seven onwards; for I am revealed in them during the fourteenth aeon.

[This could refer to the higher self or divine spark from the Logos, or to stages of initiation, as initiates must become like "little children."]

When Salome asked how long death will prevail, the Lord answered: As long as women give birth; for I came to end the works of the female. Salome said to Him, "Then I have done well by not giving birth." And the Lord replied, "Eat from every pasture, but avoid the one that brings the bitterness of death." When Salome asked when these things would be revealed, the Lord answered, "When you rise above shame, and when the two become one, and the male and female are neither male nor female.

Pray for your enemies; blessed are those who mourn for the unbelievers' destruction.

I stood on a high mountain and saw a giant man and a dwarf. I heard a voice like thunder and approached to listen. He spoke to me and said, "I am you, and you are me. Wherever you are, I am there. I am scattered in all things, and wherever you gather me, you gather yourself...

[Here again we have the mountain of initiation. The initiate beholds the vision of the Heavenly Man, the Logos, and of himself, the dwarf; of the Great Man and the little man, the light-spark which sits in the heart.]

May your Holy Spirit come upon us and purify us.

[From a very ancient version of the Lord's Prayer, instead of the clause "Thy kingdom come."]

Do not possess anything on earth.

Even if you are close to me, if you do not follow my commandments, I will cast you away.

Sons of Adam, use these temporary things, which are not truly yours, to gain what is eternal.

For even among the prophets, after they have been anointed by the Holy Spirit, they have still spoken words of sin.

If a man gives up everything for my sake, he will gain eternal life at my second coming.

["For my sake" refers to the power of the Great Name used by the Master in his teachings; the second coming is the arrival of the Christ-spirit at the candidate's initiation. "Eternal life" refers to the spiritual existence that lasts forever.]

If you do not make the below into the above and the above into the below, the right into the left and the left into the right, the before into the behind, and the behind into the before, you will not enter the kingdom of God.

[This means you will not reach the central point and enter the spiritual realm.]

I am to be crucified again.

I recognized myself and gathered myself from all directions. I did not produce children for the ruler, but I uprooted his roots and collected my scattered parts. I know who you are, for I come from the higher realms.

[This is the soul's defense as it passes through the unseen world, each part governed by a ruler, the minister of Death. Just as the Logos gathers his children (the light-sparks, parts of his body) and brings them home, the ego collects its parts and becomes unified.]

What you preach to the people, do in actions before everyone. You are the key that opens and shuts for every person.

[This saying is attributed to the disciples; directly, it would be "I am the key."]

_____________________________________;

Many other sayings could be added from Gnostic texts, especially the Coptic Codices, but enough has been provided to show that much valuable material has been forgotten and lost. Recent discoveries have shown how precious some of this material was. The ancient papyrus fragment discovered at Oxyrhynchus by Grenfell and Hunt in 1897 preserves the earliest form of the Logoi known to us. Of the six decipherable sayings it contains, one is familiar, two include new material and important variations, and three are entirely new.

If the proportion of unknown to known sayings was as high in the rest of the manuscript as in the single leaf we have, then we have indeed lost more through the Canon than we have gained. The newly discovered sayings are as follows, excluding the one already familiar to us:

Jesus said: Unless you fast to the world, you will not find the Kingdom of God; and unless you observe the Sabbath, you will not see the Father.

Jesus said: I stood in the middle of the world, and in flesh I was seen by them, and I found everyone drunk, and none thirsty among them. And My soul grieves over the souls of men because they are blind in their hearts and do not see.

Jesus said: Wherever there are two, they are not without God; and wherever there is one alone, I am with him. Lift the stone, and you will find Me; split the wood, and I am there.

[The first part of this saying is very imperfect; I have followed Blass's conjectures. See Taylor's Oxyrhynchus Logia, Oxford; 1899].

Jesus said: A prophet is not accepted in his own country, nor does a physician heal those who know him.

Jesus said: A city built on a high hill and established cannot fall or be hidden.

Jesus said: You hear with one ear (but the other you have closed).

Since the publication of the first edition of this work, the rubbish heaps of ancient Oxyrhynchus have yielded another battered scrap of papyrus containing material from a similar collection of sayings. The decipherable parts of this new fragment, as presented in Grenfell & Hunt's edition (New Sayings of Jesus; London, 1904), are as follows:

> The words Jesus the Living One spoke to Thomas and others, saying: Everyone who listens to these words shall never taste death.
>
> Jesus said: Those who seek should not stop until they find. When they find, they will be amazed; being amazed, they will rule, and ruling, they will find rest.
>
> Jesus said: You ask, who leads us to the kingdom if the kingdom is in Heaven? The birds of the air, the animals under and upon the earth, and the fish of the sea are the ones that lead you. The Kingdom of Heaven is within you, and whoever knows themselves will find it. Therefore, strive to know yourselves, and you will realize that you are the children of the Father. You will know that you are in the City of God, and you are the City.
>
> Jesus said: Everything that is not before you and that which is hidden will be revealed to you. For there is nothing hidden that will not be made known, nor buried that will not be raised.

## Conclusion

> O Light of God, adorable! We worship You, so that You may pour Your light into our minds!

Based on the Gayatri.

## Afterword

Reader, if you have come this far, you may have journeyed with me or found your own path. But if you have reached this point, it seems to me that we have journeyed together to a place of light. For some short hours, we have had the privilege to converse with those who loved and love the Master. With their words still ringing in our ears and the life of their love still in our veins, how can we speak ill of them? "Come unto Me, you weary!"

In such a light of love, how can we find it in our hearts to condemn those who devoted themselves completely to Him? When I read their words and look at their lives, I see the label "Heresy" fading away, and instead, I see the figure of the Master standing with hands outstretched in blessing above their heads.

I don't understand why this aspect of early Christianity has been forgotten. Perhaps there was a reason for its withdrawal; but today, at the beginning of the twentieth century, with the greater freedom and tolerance we now enjoy, can't we lift the veil again?

The old forms don't need to return—though some of them were beautiful! But the old power is still there, waiting to take on new forms, even more beautiful, if we turn to Him as He truly is, not limited by our sectarian beliefs.

How long will it take for us to learn that there are as many ways to worship God as there are people on earth? Yet each person still says: My way is best; mine is the only way. Or if they don't say it, they think it. These things are beyond our reason; religion is something in us greater than reason, and because it is greater, it gives greater satisfaction.

To save ourselves, we must lose ourselves; though not irrationally, if reason is transcended. If we have lived many lives before, in how many ways must we have worshipped God or failed to worship Him? How often have we condemned the way we praised before! Intolerant in one faith, equally intolerant in another, condemning our past selves.

So, what do you think of Christ? Must He not be a Master of religion, wiser than our highest ideals of wisdom? Does He condemn His worshippers because their ways are different; does He condemn those who worship His Brethren, who also taught the Way?

Regarding the rest, why worry about being overly precise? Who can truly understand and decide on these complex topics for everyone else? Let each person follow the Light as they perceive it—there’s enough for everyone; so that eventually we may see "everything transformed into light—sweet, joyous light."

These are all my words, except to add, like an ancient Coptic scribe, "O Lord, have mercy on the soul of the sinner who wrote this!"

## Bibliographies

Since there's no comprehensive bibliography on this subject, I’ve made a preliminary attempt to compile a full Bibliography of Gnosticism. I believe I’ve included every important work (and article), and I think the list of works on Coptic Gnostic writings is fairly complete. There are still some articles in periodicals and publications of learned societies (especially French) to be added, though I don’t think there are many. I could have added more references to encyclopedias, but most articles in those are of little value.

I’ve divided the General Bibliography into:

1. Early Works
2. Critical Studies prior to 1851
3. Works after the Publication of the Philosophumena text in 1851.

Division 1 generally includes works of little value; division 2 is limited by a lack of knowledge of Hippolytus' Philosophumena, which was first published by Miller at Oxford in 1851. This text has revolutionized the study of Gnosticism.

I’ve also separated the bibliography of work done on Coptic Gnostic writings, which I believe will further revolutionize our understanding of Gnosis in the future. I have commented on the most popular sources of information in English but have avoided other notes as they seem out of place in such a general work as this.

**Preface**

These volumes, complete as a series of studies in a specific tradition, aim to contribute to understanding the complex problems involved in the scientific study of the Origins of the Christian Faith. Essentially, they serve as preparatory material for examining the historical, mythical, and mystical origins of Christianity. Here, "mythical" refers to the inner, symbolic, sacred aspects, as opposed to the physical events known as "historical," and "mystical" pertains to initiation and mysteries.

I hope that serious readers will, after careful consideration, be able to envision a small part of the environment surrounding early Christianity and gain some insight into its beginnings. Although our collected material has been scrutinized using scholarly and critical methods, it also generously reveals itself as the outward manifestation of a truly significant endeavor, valuable to those willing to engage with it.We can trace the tradition of Hermes Trismegistus back in time to the sacred wisdom of Ancient Egypt. Studying this material with empathy can serve as an initiation into understanding that ancient knowledge. Although these volumes aim to demonstrate to experts that the content is presented according to modern research standards, they are also meant for those without formal qualifications but who can appreciate and think along with the authors of these beautiful writings.

Thrice-Greatest Hermes, Vol. 1, by G.R.S. Mead, [1906], at sacred-texts.com

Was he one or many, merging
Name and fame in one,
Like a stream, to which, converging,
Many streamlets run? 

Who shall call his dreams false? Who has searched or sought
All the unexplored and vast
Universe of thought? Who, confident in his own skill,
Shall with rule and line
Mark the border dividing
Human and divine? Trismegistus! Three times greatest! How your sublime name
Has descended to this latest
Generation of time! 
- LONGFELLOW, Hermes Trismegistus. 

This poem is dated January 1882. Chambers notes: "It is noteworthy that the last poem of Longfellow was a lyrical ode celebrating Hermes Trismegistus."Mead, [1906], at sacred-texts.com

THE REMAINS OF THE TRISMEGISTIC LITERATURE

WRITER AND READER

Years ago, when I started translating some of the Trismegistic writings, I never imagined it would lead to these volumes. My initial goal was simply to translate these beautiful theosophic texts into English that might reflect the worth of the original Greek. Back then, I was more captivated by the sermons than by the various problems they presented; I enjoyed the spiritual atmosphere they created more than the critical issues that kept arising as I tried to understand their significance in the development of religious ideas in the Western world. Even now, as I write this introduction for those willing to follow my efforts, I keep returning to the texts for inspiration. Each time I do, I am convinced that the best of these writings deserve all the effort one can give them.

Although these volumes, with their introductions, commentaries, and numerous notes, are structured like a technical treatise, I've aimed to make them accessible to the general reader, including those who speak only one language and may not be scholars but are still deeply interested in these studies. Therefore, these volumes may not have the precision of works by technical specialists filled with direct quotes from many ancient and modern languages. However, they appeal to a broader audience while still providing specialists with enough information to verify the statements and translations.Don't be put off by an introductory volume with the grand title of "Prolegomena," thinking that it must be dull and overly critical. The topics covered are fascinating in themselves (at least, I think so) and complement the Trismegistic sermons by often adding similar material to that found in our texts. Some of these Prolegomena developed from the Commentaries because certain subjects required such extensive discussion that they were better suited to a separate section, greatly benefiting the Commentary. Organizing all this material has been very challenging, and I haven't been able to maintain much logical order in the chapters. This is mainly because the existing Trismegistic literature is itself very disorganized, and I haven't yet found a way to bring order to this chaos.

THE EXISTING TRISMEGISTIC LITERATURE

To distinguish our works from the Egyptian "Books of Thoth," the Hermes Prayers of the popular Egyptian cult found in the Greek Magic Papyri, and the later Hermetic Alchemical literature, I have used the term Trismegistic literature instead of the usual term Hermetic. Much of this Greek Trismegistic literature has been lost. What remains, which I have tried to gather in full, falls into five categories:

A. The Corpus Hermeticum
B. The Perfect Sermon, or the Asclepius
C. Excerpts by Stobaeus
D. References and Fragments in the Church Fathers
E. References and Fragments in the Philosophers

The Corpus Hermeticum includes what was previously known as the "Poimandres" collection of fourteen sermons and the "Definitions of Asclepius.""The Perfect Sermon," also known as the Asclepius, no longer exists in Greek and is only available in an Old Latin version. There are twenty-seven excerpts from otherwise lost sermons collected by John Stobaeus, a pagan scholar from the late fifth or early sixth century. Stobaeus was an avid reader who compiled a valuable collection of extracts from Greek authors, deliberately avoiding any Christian writers. Some of these excerpts are quite long, particularly those from the sermon titled "The Virgin of the World." These twenty-seven excerpts do not include extracts from sermons that are still part of our collection.

From the Church Fathers, we have many references and twenty-five short fragments that were previously unknown to us, which greatly expand our understanding of the literature. Additionally, we get three fragments from Zosimus and Fulgentius, as well as several valuable references from Zosimus, Iamblichus, and Julian the Emperor-Philosopher.

At first glance, these may seem like scant remains of what was once a rich body of literature. However, considering that much of this literature was kept secret, we should be grateful that so much has been preserved. In fact, as we'll see later, if not for the fortunate selection of some sermons by a Hermetic apologist to demonstrate the loyalty of Trismegistic teachings toward kings and rulers, we might not have any Hermetic Corpus at all and would rely solely on extracts and fragments.

Even with the Hermetic Corpus available, we should remember that we only possess a fraction of the Trismegistic literature. It's like the floating debris of a once magnificent ship that sailed the seas of human endeavor and served as a sanctuary for many devout and cultured individuals.You'll find many references to lost writings from the School throughout our studies. Later, we will try to categorize the main types of this literature. For the other so-called Hermetic works—covering fields like medicine, mathematics, astrology, and alchemy—and for a list of many inventions attributed to Hermes Trismegistus (similar to those attributed to Orpheus in Greek tradition), students should consult Joannes Albertus Fabricius's *Bibliotheca Graeca*.

For Alchemical and Medieval literature, two essential works by Berthelot are *Collection des anciens Alchimistes grecs* (Paris, 1888) and *La Chimie au Moyen Age* (Paris, 1893). The development of this "Hermetic" tradition includes writings and traditions among the Arabs. See Beausobre's *Histoire Critique de Manichee et du Manicheisme* (Amsterdam, 1734), vol. 1, p. 326; Fleischer's *Hermes Trismegislus an die menschliche Seele, Arabisch und Deutsch* (Leipzig, 1870); Bardenhewer's *Hermetis Trismegisti qui apud Arabes fertur de Castigatione Animae Liber* (Bonn, 1873); and especially R. Pietschmann's work, *Hermes Trismegistus nach agyptischen und orientalischen Uberlieferungen* (Leipzig, 1875), which discusses the Hermes tradition among Syrians and Arabs.

Reitzenstein briefly discusses the development of this later Hermetic literature in his book *Poimandres*, on pages 188-200.### The Original Manuscript of Our Corpus

The fragmented state of the Trismegistic literature we possess makes creating a critical text challenging. Besides the main Corpus, texts need to be gathered from many authors' works. This comprehensive collection hasn't been done critically yet. As a translator, one must first find the best available critical texts of these authors. I believe I have managed this, but many ambiguities remain in the excerpts, fragments, and quotes. It would be highly beneficial for a scholar familiar with our literature to compile all these texts into one volume, utilizing the work of experts on the texts of Stobaeus and the Fathers, along with their own knowledge.

Even our Corpus lacks a thoroughly critical edition. Although Reitzenstein has done an excellent job on parts of it (C.H., i., xiii. (xiv.), and (xvi.)-(xviii.)), using five manuscripts and printed texts from earlier editions, he hasn't provided a complete text. A list of the known manuscripts at that time is in Harles' edition of Fabricius' Bibliotheca Graeca (pp. 51, 52). Parthey also gives notes on the two manuscripts he used in his edition of fourteen of the Corpus's Sermons. However, it's generally believed that more manuscripts might be hidden in Continental libraries.

All previous work on the manuscripts is now outdated due to Reitzenstein's insightful "History of the Text" (pp. 319-327). He presents the entire issue with the thoroughness typical of the best German scholarship. From him, we learn that our Hermetic Corpus was preserved thanks to a single manuscript found in poor condition in the eleventh century.Whole sections and single pages were missing, both at the beginning (after chapter 1) and the end (after chapter 16). Even in the remaining pages, especially in the last third, the writing was often illegible. In this condition, the manuscript came into the hands of Michael Psellus, the great reviver of Platonic studies in Byzantium, likely when his religious beliefs were being questioned. Psellus decided to circulate these writings again but wanted to avoid the suspicion that the contents reflected his own beliefs. This explains the peculiar note in C. H., i. 18, which initially appears to be a monkish denunciation of Poemandres as a devil trying to mislead people from the truth. However, the conclusion of the note shows such deep interest in the content that it must have been more than just a scholarly critique. The interest in these writings in the following centuries in Byzantium is evident from the fact that the last three chapters, which justify polytheism or Heathendom, were omitted in some manuscripts. Only the parts of the Corpus that seemed to align with a form of Neoplatonism compatible with Christianity were widely circulated.

The text was reproduced with thoughtless precision, so although its tradition is extremely poor, it is consistent, allowing us to reliably reconstruct Psellus’s copy from fourteenth-century texts. These Trismegistic Sermons gained wider influence with the rise of Humanism in the West.Georgius Gemistus Pletho, in the late 14th and early 15th centuries, introduced Neoplatonism from Byzantium to Italy as a form of religion, making a significant impact on Cosimo Medici. Marsilio Ficino, chosen by Cosimo to lead the future Academy, made a Latin translation of the Corpus, which was published in 1463, as the foundation for this endeavor. Cosimo had the Greek text brought from Bulgaria (Macedonia) by a monk named Fra Lionardo of Pistoia, and it remains in the Medicean Library. However, the Greek text was not printed until the mid-16th century. During this period, due to the Humanists' great interest in these writings, many manuscripts emerged aiming to make the text clearer or more elegant, but these are not valuable for the text's tradition.

TEXTS AND TRANSLATIONS

We will now discuss the texts and translations of the Trismegistic writings, a bibliographical task that the general reader might skip, but which the serious student will value.

The best account of the texts and translations up to 1790 is by Harles, who completely revised Fabricius's account.

The first edition was not a text but a Latin translation by Marsilio Ficino, published in 1471. Both the publisher's name and place of publication are missing, but the British Museum catalogue lists them as "G. de Lisa, Treviso," likely based on Harles's authority. This translation included the so-called "Poemandres," in fourteen chapters, titled Mercurii Trismegisti Liber de Potestate et Sapientia Dei (or The Book of Mercury Trismegist concerning the Power and Wisdom of God).The enormous popularity of this work is evident from the numerous editions it went through, especially for a book of that time. It had no less than twenty-two editions, with the first eight published within just twenty-five years.

In 1548, an Italian translation of Ficinus' Latin version of the "Poemandres" collection was published, titled Il Pimandro di Mercurio Trismegisto. This translation was done by Tommaso Benci and printed in Florence. A second edition, with many improvements by Paitoni, was printed in Florence in 1549.

The first Greek text was printed in Paris in 1554 by Adr. Turnebus. It included the "Poemandres" and "The Definitions of Asclepius," with Ficino's Latin version appended. The title was Mercurii Trismegisti Poemander seu de Potestate ac Sapientia Divina: Aesculapii Definitiones ad Ammonem Regem, edited by P. Angelo da Barga.

In 1557, the first French translation by Gabriel du Preau was published in Paris with a lengthy title, translating to "Two Books of Mercury Trismegistus Hermes, an ancient Theologian and excellent Philosopher. One on the power and wisdom of God, the other on the will of God, with a Dialogue by Loys Lazarel, Christian poet, titled the Basin of Hermes." This seems to be a translation of an edition of Ficinus' Latin version published in Paris by Henr. Stephanus in 1505. A certain Loys Lazarel, who also went by Septempedanus, added his own work of no significant value, as indicated by the title of Estienne's edition: Pimander Mercurii Liber de Sapientia et Potestate Dei. Asclepius, ejusdem Mercurii Liber de Voluntate Divina. Item Crater Hermetis a Lazarelo Septempedano.In 1574, Franciscus Flussas Candalle reprinted Turnebus' Greek text at Bordeaux in a quarto edition. He improved it with the help of the younger Scaliger and other Humanists and included a Latin translation, under the title "Mercurii Trismegisti Pimander sive Poemander." This text remains critically important today. Following this, he published a French translation in 1579, also in Bordeaux in a folio edition, titled "Le Pimandre de Mercure Trismegiste de la Philosophie Chrestienne, Cognoissance du Verb Divin, et de l'Excellence des Oeuvres de Dieu." This translation was assuredly made "from the Greek original, with extensive commentary." The full name and titles of Flussas, "Francois Monsieur de Foix, from the Candalle family, Captal de Buchs, Bishop of Aire, etc.," were included, and the work was dedicated to "Marguerite de France, Queen of Navarre."

Twelve years later, Franciscus Patricius (Cardinal Francesco Patrizzi) printed an edition of the text of the Sermons of the Corpus, "The Asclepius," and most of the Extracts and some Fragments. He arranged and altered the text quite arbitrarily, usually following Turnebus and Candalle's version but making numerous changes. He added a Latin translation, amending the versions of Ficino and de Foix in no less than 1040 places. These were included in his "Nova de Universis Philosophia," printed in Ferrara in folio format in 1591, and again in Venice by R. Meiettus in 1593, as an appendix to his expanded "Nov. de Un. Phil.," now fifty books. Patrizzi's Latin translation was also printed separately, along with the Chaldaean Oracles, in Hamburg in a 12mo edition in 1593, under the title "Magia Philosophica."The later edition has the title-page note, "now first brought out of the darkness from the Ranzovian Library," which Harles explains as a reprint by Henr. Ranzou, who is described in the book as "producer." It appears to have been reprinted in Hamburg in 1594 in octavo. Meanwhile, the Carmelite, Hannibal Rossellus, had been working diligently for many years on an edition of the "Poemandres" with extensive commentaries. This was printed in Cracow by Lazarus, in six folio volumes, from 1585 to 1590. Rossel discusses philosophy, theology, the Pope, the scriptures, and all disciplines in his extensive commentaries, which some people criticize as foolish, while others praise highly. His title is Pymander Mercurii Trismegisti. This was reprinted with the text and translation by de Foix in folio at Cologne in 1630, under the title Divinus Pimander Hermetis Mercurii Trismegisti.

Nothing had been done in England until 1611, when an edition of Ficinus' translation was printed in London. This was followed by a supposed translation of the "Poemandres" from Arabic, "by that learned Divine, Doctor Everard," as stated on the title-page. It was printed in London in 1650 in octavo, with a preface by "J. F.," and titled The Divine Pymander of Hermes Mercurius Trismegistus, in xvii. Books. Translated formerly out of the Arabic into Greek, then into Latin, Dutch, and now from the original into English. A second edition of Everard's version was printed in London in 1657, in duodecimo. There are also reprints of the 1650 edition by Fryar of Bath, with an introduction by Hargrave Jennings, in 1884; by P. B. Randolph, Toledo, Ohio, in 1889; and by the Theosophical Publishing Society, in the Collectanea Hermetica, edited by W. Wynn Westcott, in 1893. I cannot identify the Dutch translation Everard refers to, as the only one I know of was printed in Amsterdam in 1652 in duodecimo.The text is a translation of Patrizzi's work, titled "Sixteen Books of Hermes Trismegistus," translated from Greek. It includes a preface in Latin by F. Patricius, where he argues that this philosopher lived before Moses. Harles mentions an edition printed in Amsterdam in 1643 by Nicholas van Rauenstein, but I cannot find any other evidence of it.

The first German translation was by Alethophilus, printed in Hamburg in 1706 under the title "Hermetis Trismegisti Erkantnuss der Natur," containing seventeen pieces. This was reprinted in Stuttgart in 1855 in a collection by J. Schieble, titled "Kleiner Wunder-Schauplatz." The full title reads "Hermetis Trismegisti Einleitung in's hochste Wissen von Erkentniss der Natur und der darin sich offenbarenden grossen Grottes," with an appendix about Hermes. It is unclear why Schieble reprinted Alethophilus' translation when a new German translation with critical notes by Dieterich Tiedemann had appeared in 1781. Tiedemann's translation, titled "Hermes Trismegists Poemander, oder von der gottlichen Macht und Weisheit," was already considered rare by 1827, and the British Museum does not have a copy.

It is notable that despite numerous enthusiastic translations, there have been few editions of the original text. For over two centuries, no one attempted to compare different manuscripts.In 1854, Gustav Parthey published a critical edition of the fourteen pieces of "Poemandres" in Berlin, titled *Hermetis Trismegisti Poemander*. He included a Latin translation based on an original version by Ficino, which was later revised by de Foix and Patrizzi. Although Parthey had promised to edit the remaining writings of Hermes, he never did, and no one else has taken on this important task since. Reitzenstein has a very unfavorable opinion of Parthey's text. Firstly, Parthey accepted Patrizzi's arbitrary changes as authentic. Secondly, he did not personally examine the manuscripts he claimed to rely on. The first manuscript was carelessly copied and used by Parthey, while the second, copied by D. Hamm, was highly corrupted by numerous later "corrections" and additions, all of which Parthey mistakenly adopted as original. Therefore, Reitzenstein concludes that Parthey's text is doubly falsified, which is disappointing for those who value accuracy.

In 1866, a complete French translation of the Trismegistic treatises and fragments by Louis Menard was published in Paris. Titled *Hermes Trismegiste*, it included an interesting study on the origin of the Hermetic books, with a second edition printed in 1867. This translation is considered the most sympathetic version available. Everard's version of the "Poemandres" was reprinted in 1884 by Fryar of Bath. The rest of the treatises were retranslated by Anna Kingsford and Edward Maitland from Menard's French version (including his notes) and published in 1885 under the general title *The Hermetic Works: The Virgin of the World of Hermes Mercurius Trismegistus*.In 1882, J. D. Chambers published a difficult and extremely literal translation of the "Poemandres" in Edinburgh, along with excerpts from Stobaeus and references to Hermes by early Christian writers. This work was titled The Theological and Philosophical Works of Hermes Trismegistus, Christian Neoplatonist. Despite its flaws, Everard's loose and error-prone version is much easier to understand than Chambers' overly literal translation.

For the past six years, I have been publishing translations of the Trismegistic Sermons and some related studies in The Theosophical Review. These translations have now been carefully revised, and the studies have been significantly expanded and improved. In 1904, E. Reitzenstein from Strassburg published an insightful study titled Poimandres in Leipzig. He provided a critical text based on five manuscripts and the best early printed editions, demonstrating meticulous care and expertise in paleography and philology.

It is puzzling why Reitzenstein has not applied the same rigorous approach to the entire Corpus Hermeticum as he did to the selected sermons. He is well-suited for this task, and his efforts would be highly valued by many scholars. Regarding existing translations of Trismegistic literature, Everard's 1650 version, although popular in England for its elegant language, is filled with errors and misunderstandings, making it impossible to truly comprehend "Hermes" from this translation.Chambers's 1882 translation (from Parthey's text) is so literal that it often doesn't read like English, sometimes misses the meaning, and is generally frustrating. Menard's 1866 French translation (also from Parthey's text) is elegant and empathetic but takes many liberties, often straying far from the original text. The most accurate translation in terms of literal meaning is Parthey's Latin version (based on Ficino's Latin translation, as corrected by Candalle and Patrizzi). However, even this version occasionally has errors, and generally, one cannot fully understand the Latin without referring to the Greek. Translating "Hermes" requires not only a good knowledge of Greek but also an understanding of the Gnosis that Hermes often conveys so well.

R. (p. 320) claims the date is 1463, but I have found no evidence of this edition.

The dates of these editions are as follows, though there were likely others now lost: 1471, '72, '81, '83, '91, '93, '94, '97; 1503, '05, '16, '22, '32, '49, '52, '54, '61, '70, '76, '77; 1611, '41. They were printed in Venice, Paris, Basel, Lyon, and London.

The writer has carefully read it, and unlike the British Museum, he owns a copy of this rare work.

Upon reading, these prove to be of little value. 

R. 322 calls him a Minorite.

It is clear, however, that Everard translated from Ficinus' Latin version, and that the "Arabick" is a myth.

Only 200 copies were issued to subscribers, as if they were gaining great "occult" secrets.

Part of the full title runs: K. W.-S. d. Wissenschaften, Mysterien, Theosophie, göttlichen und morgenländischen Magie, Naturkräfte, hermet. u. magnet. Phil., Kabbala, u. and. höheren Kenntnissen, and much more in the same vein, but I am sure the reader has had enough. From 1855 to 1857, fourteen parts were published, mostly German translations of Hermes, Agrippa's Philosophia Occulta from Latin, and The Telescope of Zoroaster from French.

Op. inf. cit., p. 10.

I have not been able to use Tiedemann's work. R. 322 speaks highly of it.

The last edition before Parthey's was the reprint of Flussas' text, at Cologne in 1630, appended to Rossel's writings.

As mentioned before, I have not seen a copy of Tiedemann's German edition.**II**

**THE HISTORY OF THE EVOLUTION OF OPINION**

**KEY QUESTIONS**

We now need to consider the following interesting points:

The early Church Fathers generally accepted the Trismegistic writings as very ancient and authoritative. They often quoted these texts in their apologetic writings to support the core principles of Christianity. During the Renaissance, for over a century and a half, all Humanists embraced these writings as valuable additions to Christianity, agreeing with its doctrines so much that they attempted to replace Aristotle with Trismegistus in schools. However, over the past two and a half centuries, a growing opinion emerged, initially small but eventually dominant, that these writings were Neoplatonic forgeries and copied from Christianity. Finally, with the dawn of the twentieth century, this topic has moved beyond mere opinion and is being established through historical and critical research, revealing significant insights into the origins of Christianity and its connection with Hellenistic theology and theosophy, and shedding light on the development of Gnosticism. The first point will be detailed in an upcoming volume that will include translations of all passages and references to Thrice-greatest Hermes in the Church Fathers' writings, while the last point will become clear throughout our studies.Let's focus on the second and third points, especially the third. We have put a lot of effort into understanding all the arguments supporting this opinion, and we remain unconvinced unless we need to completely rethink the timeline of what's called Neoplatonism. We find that this opinion is built on unproven claims, and no single work convincingly argues the topic. Most writers just repeat or echo previous opinions, and their statements could just as easily support the Trismegistic school's precedence over Neoplatonism as the opposite. We will now review this jumble of conflicting opinions, highlighting the key points.

THE OPINIONS OF THE HUMANISTS

It's clear from the bibliography we've provided that the early scholars of the Renaissance were unanimously impressed with the Trismegistic writings. It's natural that they followed the judgment of the ancient Fathers on this matter; they believed the books were written before Christianity and were confident that Hermes was a real person, like Biblical figures such as Enoch and Noah (a belief common in those days), and that he lived before or at the same time as Moses.

In Ficino's first edition, we read: "Whoever you are reading this, whether a grammarian, rhetorician, philosopher, or theologian, know that I am Hermes the Thrice-great, admired first by the Egyptians and other nations, and later by the early Christian theologians, who were amazed by my rare divine teachings."Ficino believed that the author of the "Poemandres" texts had knowledge of both Egyptian and Greek. This view is interesting because Ficino, being free from the endless doubts of modern criticism, could connect clearly with his subject. Loys Lazarel and du Preau, the first French translator, shared this belief. The Italian Cardinal Patrizzi added these beautiful words, attributed by some to Chalcidius, which he attributed to Hermes:

"My son, I have lived in exile, far from home. Now I am returning safely. When I soon leave you, free from my bodily bonds, do not mourn me as dead. I return to a supreme and happy state where the citizens of the universe will go after this life. There, the Only God is the supreme lord and will fill His citizens with joy far greater than what we consider life here, which should rather be called death."

Patrizzi believed Hermes was a contemporary of Moses, based on Eusebius' opinion in his Chronicum. He thought it would greatly benefit the Christian world if the Trismegistic writings, which contained admirable and pious philosophy, replaced Aristotle's works in public schools, as he found Aristotle's works full of impiety.

These views were still prevalent as late as 1630, as shown by the continued favor of the extensive commentaries of de Foix and Rossel. However, about fifty years earlier, a bold skeptic had questioned the validity of the widely accepted Hermes tradition on at least one fundamental point. Patrizzi mentions that a certain Jo.Goropius Becanus was the first in many centuries to claim that Hermes (as a single person) never existed. Goropius, who seemed to be active around 1580 based on his antiquarian treatise on the "Cimbri or Germani" race and language published in Amsterdam, had no followers for this belief, which is now widely accepted by scholars. However, this issue relates to the Hermes legend and not directly to the Trismegistic works, so we can disregard the numerous conflicting opinions on "Hermes" from earlier writers, as none of them, before hieroglyphics were deciphered, hold much value.

The Theory of Plagiarism

Around the mid-17th century, the theory of plagiarism and forgery emerged. Joh. Henr. Ursinus, a pastor in Ratisbon, published a work in Nuremberg in 1661, in which he argued that the writings of Hermes Trismegistus were largely plagiarized from Christianity. His arguments faced strong criticism from Brucker about a hundred years later.

Ursinus's extreme view was later softened into the opinions that the Trismegistic works were either composed by a half-Christian or altered by Christian influence. The most notable early proponent of the first opinion was Isaac Casaubon, who dated these writings to the early second century. However, Casaubon's views were quickly refuted by Cudworth in his famous work The True Intellectual System of the Universe, first published in London in 1678.Cudworth argued that Casaubon was correct about the treatises titled "The Shepherd of Men" and "The Secret Sermon on the Mountain," claiming they were forged by Christians since Iamblichus' time. This is a curious stance since some treatises refer to "The Shepherd" as the foundational document of the "Poemandres" cycle. However, without solid arguments or critical investigation, we shouldn't dwell on these conflicting opinions. Colberg's vehement defense of orthodoxy against groups like Alchemists, Rosicrucians, Quakers, Anabaptists, and Quietists, whom he labeled as fanatics, culminated this debate, declaring Hermes as their patriarch.

THE ONLY ARGUMENT PRESENTED

It almost seems like Colberg was a reincarnated Church Father continuing his fight against heresy. This revived the heresy debate, and 18th and 19th-century criticism of the Trismegistic works often started with this bias, attributing them to Neoplatonism, seen as orthodoxy's main opponent from the 3rd century onward. Harles (1790) cited all major factors in this 18th-century opinion evolution. Yet, the only argument presented—and the only one ever offered—is that the doctrines in the Trismegistic writings are clearly Platonic, specifically the mystical Platonism taught by Iamblichus in the late 3rd century A.D., known as Neoplatonism. Thus, these writings were supposedly forged by Neoplatonists to support declining Paganism against the rising tide of Christianity.We accept the premises, but we completely reject the conclusion. Before highlighting the flaws in this conclusion of apologetic scholarship, we must review the literature on the subject from the last century. The eighteenth century offered no new arguments supporting this conclusion beyond the main premises we have already accepted. Has the nineteenth century provided any additional arguments to justify the stance taken by popular encyclopedias regarding these valuable and beautiful treatises?

If our encyclopedias rely on authority, they refer to Fabricius (Harles) and Baumgarten-Crusius. We've already seen that Harles isn't very helpful; will Baumgarten-Crusius offer more insight? We doubt it; instead of a substantial volume, we have a brief academic paper of only 19 pages, in which the author simply claims that these books were created by Porphyry and his followers. He bases this mainly on the belief that Orelli had proven the previous year that Sanchoniathon's Cosmogony was invented by the "Platonici." Furthermore, wasn't Porphyry an enemy of Christ, as he wrote fifteen books against the Christians? All of this hardly qualifies as an argument, let alone proof.

THE THEORY OF HILGERS

The same can be said of Hilgers' short academic thesis. He first points out the weaknesses in Mohler's strange opinion that the author was a Christian pretending to be a Pagan and deliberately inserted "errors." Hilgers concludes with the weak assertion that the author of the "Poemandres" cycle was familiar with Christian doctrine, particularly the Gospel of John and Paul's Letters, but he admits he cannot speculate beyond that.Hilgers doesn't seem to consider the possibility that the "Poemandres" could have come before the writings of John and Paul. However, this is just as reasonable as the connections he draws between the two groups of literature. But Hilgers has his own agenda, and a not very sharp one at that. He believes that "The Shepherd of Men" was written at the same time as "The Shepherd of Hermas," a simple work from the sub-apostolic age that was highly respected by early Christian communities for its moral teachings. Hilgers thinks our "Shepherd" was written to oppose the Hermas document, but he can only point to the similarity in their names as evidence. We will challenge this upside-down opinion in a later chapter on "'Hermes' and 'Hermas.'"

Hilgers believes he has proven that the author of our "Shepherd" was not a follower of Christ's teachings, but rather of the Neoplatonists, especially Philo Judaeus. In fact, he suggests the author might have been a Therapeut.

THE GERMAN THEORY OF NEOPLATONIC "SYNCRETISMUS"

Here we see another trend emerging. The more we study the Trismegistic writings, the clearer it becomes that they cannot be attributed to Neoplatonism if we accept that Neoplatonism began with Ammonius Saccas, Plotinus, and Porphyry in the third century. Therefore, some later scholars have tried to include Philo Judaeus, who lived in the first half of the first century, among the Neoplatonists. If we continue along these lines, we would soon trace Neoplatonism back to Plato and Pythagoras and be forced to drop the "Neo," returning to the original name "Platonici."By this time in Germany, the theory of Neoplatonic Syncretism, which aimed to support declining Heathenism against the rise of Christianity, had already formed. This is evident from the article on "Hermes, Hermetische Schriften" in Pauly's renowned Real Encyclopadie der classischen Alterthumswissenshaft (Stuttgart, 1844), where this stance is taken from the outset. However, in 1854, Parthey, in his preface, did not share this opinion. He expressed hope that a demotic text of the "Poemandres" might still be found in Egypt, indicating he believed the original was written in Egyptian, not by a Neoplatonist.

### THE FRENCH THEORY OF EGYPTIAN ORIGIN

Around the same time in France, in 1858, Artaud argued for the Egyptian origins of the Trismegistic writings in a sensible manner. He did so in his article on "Hermes Trismegiste" in Hoeffer's Nouvelle Biographie Generale, published in Paris by Messrs Firmin Didot. Artaud wrote:

"In a mystical sense, Thoth, or the Egyptian Hermes, symbolized the Divine Mind; he was the incarnated Thought, the living Word—the original model of the Logos of Plato and the Word of the Christians. Champollion, the younger, expressed the formal opinion that the books of Hermes Trismegistus contained ancient Egyptian doctrine, evident from the hieroglyphics on Egyptian monuments. When examined, these fragments reveal a theology that aligns with the doctrines in Plato's Timaeus—doctrines distinct from other Greek schools and thought to be derived from Egyptian temples, where Plato conversed with priests."

Artaud also believed that these Trismegistic treatises were translations from Egyptian.### The Views of Menard

Today, with our advanced understanding of Egyptology, this hypothesis must be stated more carefully to be accepted by scholars. However, it was clearly the conviction of Deveria, who, in a work he only managed to start, aimed to comment on the entire text of the Trismegistic Books from an Egyptologist's perspective. He believed these Books offered an almost complete exposition of the esoteric philosophy of ancient Egypt.

But the most sympathetic and intelligent account on the subject comes from Menard. His perspective provides a refreshing break from the dominant theory of German Neoplatonic syncretism. While we don’t agree with everything he writes, his views offer a much-needed fresh perspective. The fragments of Trismegistic literature we have today are the sole surviving remnants of the "Egyptian philosophy" that emerged from the merging of Egyptian religious doctrines with Greek philosophical ideas. In other words, just as Philo’s works related to Jewish sacred literature, the Hermaica related to Egyptian sacred writings. Legends and myths were turned into allegories and philosophies, replaced by visions and teachings.

But who created this theosophic method? This question is crucial for understanding the literary evolution of Christianity, as there are significant similarities between some Hermetic documents and certain Jewish and Christian writings, especially the opening verses of Genesis, Philo's treatises, the fourth Gospel (particularly the Prologue), and the writings of prominent Gnostic thinkers like Basilides and Valentinus.These kinds of considerations led Menard to examine the early environment of Christianity and the various phenomena associated with its growth from the perspective of an independent and enlightened historical scholar. "Christianity," he writes, "did not suddenly appear in a shocked and unprepared world. It had a period of development, and while it was forming its specific doctrines, the issues it sought to address were already being considered in Greece, Asia, and Egypt. Similar ideas were prevalent and took shape in various ways. 

The numerous sects that have emerged in our time under the name of socialism offer only a faint idea of the remarkable intellectual activity that had its main center in Alexandria. Humanity was tackling major philosophical and moral issues: the origin of evil, the destiny of the soul, its fall and redemption; the prize was the control of moral conscience. The Christian answer prevailed and caused other ideas to be largely forgotten, mostly relegated to history. When we come across remnants of these old ideas, we should recognize them as the work of a defeated competitor, not a plagiarist. Indeed, the success of Christianity was facilitated by those who considered themselves its rivals but were actually its forerunners. This title fits them, though many lived during the Christian era while others came a bit later; for a religion’s true establishment dates from the time it is accepted by nations, just as a claimant’s rule begins from their victory" (pp. ix., x.). Menard identifies three main groups in the Trismegistic writings, attributing them to Jewish, Greek, and Egyptian influences. He also sees a connection between these writings, Philo, and the Gnostics.Between the early Gnostic sects and the Hellenic Jews represented by Philo, there is a missing link. This link can be found in several Hermetic works, especially "The Shepherd of Men" and "The Sermon on the Mountain." These works might also explain the differences between the first three Gospels and the fourth. Menard suggests that "The Shepherd" likely originated from the Therapeuts of Egypt, who have often been mistakenly associated with the Essenes of Syria and Palestine. Unlike the Essenes, who practiced manual labor and communal living, the Therapeuts focused on abstract speculation and mystic allegories, contributing to Christian thought. This influence, combined with the idea of incarnation, led to the formation of Gnostic sects. "The Shepherd" should be earlier than these schools. "The Sermon on the Mountain" can be placed between "The Shepherd" and the first Gnostic schools, slightly earlier than Gnostic founders like Basilides and Valentinus.

If we consider Gnosticism, as described by Menard, to be the Christianized theosophy of Basilides and Valentinus from the early second century onwards, then the oldest Trismegistic texts are clearly earlier. Their form of Gnosticism is much simpler. If we followed a straightforward evolutionary theory, we would need to identify intermediate forms of Gnosticism between these texts and the more developed Gnosticism of Basilides and Valentinus.Menard seems to be somewhat aware of this when he writes: "In the Hermetic books, we can trace the fate of this Judaeo-Egyptian Gnosis. In the first century, it coexisted with Christianity without being absorbed by it, gradually transitioning from the Jewish school of Philo to the Greek school of Plotinus" (p. lxvii.). Menard used the term Christianity to refer to what later became known as Catholic or General Christianity, the tradition to which these Gnostics contributed key theological dogmas. But if the Gnostics were Therapeuts and the Trismegistic writers were also Therapeuts, why does Menard refer to them as Jews in his question, "Where are the Jewish Therapeuts at the end of the second century?" Philo may have tried to portray the Therapeuts as mainly Jewish to gain respect for his people, but the Therapeuts were clearly from various nations and spread across many communities, although many Jews were likely among them. In fact, Philo probably knew little about their communities beyond the Mareotic. Thus, the term "Therapeut" might clarify some aspects of these writings, but "Jewish Therapeuts" is not accurate. Menard's own response to his question indicates that even the Mareotic Therapeuts couldn't have been orthodox Jews. He speculates that some converted to Christianity and became monks or Gnostics of the Basilidian or Valentinian school, while others increasingly assimilated into Paganism.The author clarifies that by "Paganism," he does not mean "polytheism." During this period, everyone acknowledged a clear hierarchy in the divine order, with a supreme God at the top. For some, this supreme God was part of the world; for others, outside it. Menard's introduction is generally well-received by Reitzenstein, who praises its subtlety and agrees with Menard's theological insights. However, Reitzenstein disagrees with Menard on the idea of any direct Jewish influence on the Trismegistic literature, insisting that the "Poemandres" cannot be considered a Jewish-Gnostic text. Despite Menard's sensible views, the German theory persisted, reiterated by Zeller and Pietschmann in his scholarly essay, partially based on A. G. Hoffmann's article "Hermes" in Ersch and Gruber's General Encyclopedia of Sciences and Arts.

Aall offers an exception to this trend, suggesting, without providing evidence, that the Hermetic literature (though it's unclear if he means the existing Trismegistic sermons) originated as far back as the second century B.C. He believes it is an offshoot from the same source that later influenced the core concepts of Johannine theology.

ENGLISH ENCYCLOPEDISM

In England, the topic, like many others of a similar nature, has been largely ignored. However, with the encyclopedic efforts of the past generation, it has been briefly addressed in the typical encyclopedic manner. The German position is accepted without any proof or reference, presented as an "established fact of science."The "last effort of dying Heathendom" theory is presented with confidence and an air of authority, much like the family doctor whose words are accepted without question by the entire family—from the baby to the father—until a specialist is consulted.

Unfortunately, these authoritative-sounding declarations are often all the general public hears. This is the case with several mediocre articles in our current reference dictionaries. We are told that the writings are Neoplatonic, without any clarification or definition of the term. In these dictionaries, "Neoplatonic" typically refers to the philosophical tradition starting from Ammonius Saccas and Plotinus. This implies that these so-called Neoplatonic forgeries must date from at least the mid-third century onwards.

However, Justin Martyr (around 150 A.D.) praised these same writings and considered their author, "Hermes," among the "most ancient philosophers." This fact has been conveniently ignored by both German theorists and their English followers. Due to this and other reasons, Chambers, in the preface to his 1882 translation, redefined the term Neoplatonist to apply to Hermes and argued that Hermes should be regarded as the true founder of Neoplatonism.

Despite Justin's clear testimony, Chambers tries to place the earliest Trismegistic writings between the New Testament's composition and Justin's time. He spends most of his notes trying to find any New Testament verses that resemble the Trismegistic text.When we closely compare these so-called parallels, we must admit that if there is any plagiarism, it is not by Hermes. In fact, it is clear that there is no verbal plagiarism at all. The similarity of ideas points to a different issue because the key beliefs of mainstream Christianity are completely absent. There is no mention of the historical Jesus, his birth, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, or return for judgment, as Chambers acknowledges.

German Encyclopedism

Let's now look at what German encyclopedias say on the subject. F. A. Brockhaus' Conversations-Lexikon (Leipzig, 1884) repeats the old theory, calling the Trismegistic writings "the last monuments of Heathendom." The author reluctantly dates most of these writings to the second century, but doesn't explain how this conclusion was reached. 

An extremely valuable article, perhaps the best so far, is by Chr. Scherer on "Hermes" in W. H. Roscher's Detailed Lexicon of Greek and Roman Mythology (Leipzig, 1884, etc.). It includes numerous references to recent scholarly articles and scientific journals. However, this article only discusses the Greek Hermes, and for "Hermes Trismegistos," we are directed to an article on "Thoth," which hasn't been published yet.

This brings us up to the end of the last century. We may have missed some minor opinions due to the lack of a current bibliography on the subject, but we doubt any significant work has been overlooked.### A Recent Article by Granger

Frank Granger recently published an article in England this century. Although he offers some useful critiques and suggestions on various points, his main argument is rather conservative. He argues that our most important texts have Christian origins. Granger outlines his study by stating:

"We will have little trouble showing, contrary to Zeller's view, that the book [either our entire collection or just the first sermon] is mainly consistent and of Christian origin. Our discussion will also touch on later Greek culture as it developed in Egypt, raising several important issues. Among other things, we will explore how Hermes was integrated into Christian tradition and how Greek depictions of Hermes influenced early Christian art. Furthermore, we will find a bridge between Greek philosophy and science and genuinely Christian ways of thinking. However, the writer maintains enough of the old spirit that he cannot be mistaken for a defender of Paganism."

When Granger tries to prove his argument, he falls short, mainly relying on the popular phrase "increase and multiply." Towards the end of his study, he acknowledges that traditional values may need to be revised based on our literature. He writes:

"The traditional view of Gnosticism needs to be reconsidered in light of the Poemandres. It comes from a time when religious definitions were still forming—a time when the boundaries of free discussion were not yet strictly defined."The various forms of religious belief found in the works of Irenaeus, Hippolytus, and Tertullian were not seen by their proponents as conflicting with the Christian faith. Instead, they were viewed as new and valuable interpretations of common principles. Over time, ecclesiastical opinion settled on a particular direction. However, before this consensus was reached, each system of belief, including the one found in the Poemandres, had the potential to prevail. The Poemandres is not merely a heretical work; it can be seen as aligning with the earlier intellectual stance of Clement of Alexandria.

The difficulties faced by our essayist in his hypothesis of Christian origin would be greatly reduced by accepting the broader evidence from Trismegistic and related literatures. He should consider what he calls Gnosticism as Christianized Gnosis rather than Gnosticized Christianity. This approach leads Granger to estimate the date of the "Poemandres" to be towards the end of the second century. Despite this, he acknowledges the possibility of even earlier material being present. While we may disagree with Granger's conclusions about the "Poemandres," we agree with the importance he places on the Gospel according to the Egyptians. He notes that Salome, who is significant in this gospel, is the mother of St. John, and that the same Gnostic circles familiar with this gospel were also the first to reference the Fourth Gospel.The Fourth Gospel, also known as the Gospel of John, is believed to have been influenced by the Alexandrine Gnostics. Valentinus’ system can be seen as an imaginative interpretation of the early chapters of this Gospel. Heracleon, the first significant commentator on the Gospel of John, was both a Gnostic and a mentor to Origen, thus shaping orthodox theology. The key to understanding the Fourth Gospel lies in the Gnostic ideas found in the Poemandres, with Heracleon providing crucial insights. However, scholars have often ignored the valuable perspectives offered by the Gnostics. As a result, the Gospel has been misunderstood, particularly due to an overemphasis on the doctrine of the Logos.

There is some confusion about the final sentence's intent. While the doctrine of the Logos is a fundamental concept in Hellenistic theology, too much emphasis has been placed on the claim that the prologue of the Fourth Gospel represents a uniquely Christian doctrine. Furthermore, if the Fourth Gospel originated in Alexandrine circles and is deeply Gnostic, it raises questions about attributing its authorship to "St. John," as Granger seems to suggest. This leads to different conclusions than those Granger proposes.

Recent English scholarship on "Poemandres" concludes that it is a significant reflection of the religious and philosophical ideas from which Alexandrine theology emerged. "Poemandres" connects with Greek mythology and science, as well as Jewish and Christian literature. The author is more rational and consistent than many of his Gnostic contemporaries, including Clement.If, as we will demonstrate, the date of the "Poemandres" needs to be moved back at least a hundred years, and if it likely goes back even further, the entire issue changes, and the relationships between all the factors change proportionately.

REITZENSTEIN AND THE DAWN OF CLEARER UNDERSTANDINGS

In this century, the publication of Reitzenstein's Poimandres has changed the entire perspective and clarified the subject. Reitzenstein approaches the Trismegistic writings from an objective, historical, philological, and literary viewpoint. Free from any theological biases, he bases his conclusions solely on critical research in philology. However, he occasionally points out, somewhat slyly, that these findings are very interesting and potentially challenging for theologians, especially for those with traditional views. The overall scope of Reitzenstein's essay can be understood from its subtitle, "Studies in Greek-Egyptian and Early Christian Literature." Our Trismegistic writings are part of a large collection of Greek texts that are remnants of a once vast Hellenistic theological literature. Hellenistic theology refers to the blending of Greek and Oriental religious thought and experience, heavily influenced by Egyptian ideas and traditions. The Egyptian religion spread throughout the Hellenistic world, and many Greek writers have written about it. There are numerous references to Egyptian beliefs in Greek literature, much more so than references to Babylonian, Persian, or even Syrian beliefs.Despite this, the remnants of Hellenistic theological literature have never been thoroughly examined from a philological perspective. This neglect is due to Christian theologians' complete disregard for the subject and the absurd reasons often cited for dismissing Hellenistic-Egyptian religion. One notable theologian recently claimed that Egyptian worship was universally scorned as the height of human superstition by both Jews and Greeks. Given Egypt's significant role in Hellenistic literature, it must have also had a strong influence on Hellenistic culture and religious development. Early Christian literature provides evidence of this influence. Therefore, by studying Greek-Egyptian and Early Christian documents together, we can systematically compare their literatures. The language and themes of Christian writings inevitably reflect the broader Hellenistic theology of the time.

Reitzenstein's study focuses on Trismegistic literature, analyzing and comparing two typical sermons with other Hellenistic texts and Early Christian writings. His work is thorough, insightful, and scholarly. However, it is only useful to specialized scholars because it is filled with technical details and untranslated texts.Reitzenstein is part of a group of strict philologists who believe translating texts diminishes their dignity. This approach is quite convenient, and I've often wished I could use it when facing difficult translations. Reitzenstein doesn't translate anything but focuses on texts and advanced criticism. However, he doesn't provide the complete text of our literature or even the entire Corpus Hermeticum—only four chapters and a fragment of a fifth. His findings are hard to summarize, and he doesn't summarize them himself. His chapters are more like studies of Trismegistic literature rather than a full explanation. Despite this, his work is the most important and thought-provoking on the subject. I will frequently refer to his work, and I must acknowledge the gratitude all enthusiasts of our sermons owe him for highlighting the significance of Trismegistic literature in the history of early religious thought.

The main chapters of his studies are as follows:
1. Age of the "Poimandres" (referring to C. H., i. only)
2. Analysis of the "Poimandres"
3. Fundamental Conception of the "Poimandres"
4. "Poimandres" and the Egyptian Apocalyptic Literature
5. Expansion of the Hermetic Literature
6. The Hermetic Corpus
7. The Later "Poimandres" Document (The Prophet-Initiation)

The idea of plagiarism from Christianity must be completely rejected.The entire body of literature is based on the "Poemandres" as its original gospel, and this scripture's original form must date back to at least before the second century A.D. We cannot say exactly how much earlier it goes, but it cannot be later than the start of the second century. Therefore, looking for traditional Christian thoughts in this document is futile.

Reitzenstein tells us that he was initially interested in these writings because of their literary form. However, his interest grew as he recognized them as important records of a significant religious movement that spread from the East to the West, paving the way for Christianity and eventually carrying it forward. The best evidence of this religious revival is found in the literary form of Hellenistic theology. Given the eagerness to examine contemporary literature for insights into the origins and development of Christianity, it is surprising that the Trismegistic writings have been so neglected.

But there is an even more fascinating aspect of this subject that is not covered in purely philological or critical studies. The more one studies these mystical sermons without prejudice and tries to understand the writers' perspectives, the closer one feels to what might have been the true core of the best mystery traditions of antiquity.There are countless indications of the vastness and significance that lie beyond that threshold—among other valuable insights, the vision of the key to Egypt's wisdom and the interpretation of revelations through the clear understanding of the intelligible cosmos. Such greatness and mysteries have a power and beauty that even the most flawed traditions, passed down through unknowing hands, cannot completely hide. They are still recognizable, even though they appear in the tattered remnants of their once fine garments, to those who have the perception to see and hear.

Returning to the questions we raised at the beginning of this chapter:

If we rephrase the problems we are considering as questions, we need to find answers to the following:

Why did the early Church Fathers regard the Trismegistic writings as extremely ancient and authoritative, quoting them to support the main impersonal dogmas of Christianity in their apologetic writings? Why did all the Humanists during the Renaissance, for more than a century and a half, enthusiastically embrace these writings as a valuable addition to Christianity, believing them to align with its main doctrines, to the extent that they aimed to replace Aristotle with Trismegistus in the schools? Finally, why has the prevailing opinion over the last two and a half centuries evolved, starting small but now almost dominating, that these writings are Neoplatonic forgeries?

The answers to these questions are simple: The Church Fathers relied on the authority of ancient traditions that had never been questioned to show that they were not teaching anything fundamentally new—that, in essence, they were teaching the same core principles that Hermes had taught.They lived too close to that tradition to accuse it of plagiarism and forgery without risking a strong rebuttal from people who still heard its "living voice" and had its "written word." Renaissance scholars naturally followed the consistent tradition of antiquity, supported by the Church Fathers. However, over time, it was understood that if the old tradition was accepted, the unique originality of general Christian doctrines—the philosophical foundation of the Faith, separate from its specific historical beliefs—could no longer be upheld. Therefore, it became necessary to discredit the ancient tradition by any means possible.

We have already seen the success of this policy; we have also reviewed the growth of this opinion and shown its baseless nature and the difficulties its defenders faced. From this confusion, the wisdom of Thrice-greatest Hermes and the brilliance of his knowledge have once again emerged in the realm of humanistic inquiry and unbiased research. He is no longer to be called a fraud and thief but must be recognized as a genuine teacher, sharing his own insights and generously offering his knowledge to all who are willing to accept it.^21:1 Zoroaster from Bactria, Hermes Trismegistus, Sanchuniathon the Phoenician, and their writings, along with others, argue against the antiquity of the Mosaic Scriptures. These discussions are found in "Exercitationes Familiares," pages 73-180—a book that is now very rare.

^21:3 In "De Rebus Sacris... Exercitationes ad Card. Baronii Prolegomena," volume 1, note 10 (London, 1614), Casaubon concludes that the entire book, "Poemandres," is a pseudepigraph, likely the invention of a Christian or semi-Christian author (page 56).

Ehre Gott Daniel Colberg, in 2 volumes (Frankfurt and Leipzig, 1690, 1691).

^23:1 Op. supra cit.; the most "advanced" writer on the subject is Tiedemann, whose work we have already mentioned. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain a copy, and the British Museum does not have it. Tiedemann believes that none of the Trismegistic writings existed before the fourth century, while Fabricius, whose summary of prior opinion is extensively used by Harles, assigns them to the time of Porphyry and Iamblichus. Harles, however, dates the earliest writings from the end of the first to the middle of the second century (page 48, note).Certainly, here's the simplified and modernized version of the text:

Gibbon believed some of the Trismegistic writings had Christian origins and dismissed them as Christian forgeries, comparing Hermes to Orpheus and the Sibyls (vol. ii. p. 69, Bury's ed.).

You can see how the public is informed by looking at any popular knowledge digest. For example, The American Encyclopaedia (1874) describes Hermes Trismegistus as part of Neoplatonism's effort to give a deeper, more spiritual meaning to pagan philosophy by combining Egyptian and Greek wisdom and presenting it as an ancient divine revelation.

Menard should have described it as the popular Christian solution.

Zeller's "Geschichte der griechischen Philosophie," III., ii., 225 ff., recognizes the Gnostic nature of some parts of the Corpus Hermeticum but views the rest as reflecting declining Paganism. Erdmann agrees in "Hist. Philos.," i. 113, 2, Tr.The author focuses solely on our Corpus and attributes its sermons to various authors and periods. He argues that C. H. xiii. (xiv.) exhibits a Neo-pythagorean influence, a term even more ambiguous than Neo-platonic.

Hermes Trismegistos n. agyp., griech. u. oriental. Uberlieferungen (Leipzig, 1875) is a detailed article full of references, but it only addresses the Hermes legend and not our texts.

Aall's works (Geschichte der Logosidee in der Philosophie, Leipzig, vol. i. 1896, vol. ii. 1899) reference this on page 78, note 4. Reitzenstein's Zwei religionsgeschichtliche Fragen (Strassburg, 1901), page 93, note 3, also provides relevant insights.

Articles like "Hermes and Hermes Trismegistus" by L. Schmitz in Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology (London, 1870), Jowett's "Hermes Trismegistus" in the Encyclopaedia Britannica (9th ed., London, 1880), and Mozley's "Hermes Trismegistus" in Smith and Wace's Dictionary of Christian Biography (London, 1882) are outdated and their content similarly applies.

The Theological and Philosophical Works of Hermes Trismegistus, Christian Neoplatonist, is another significant reference.

This repeats de Foix's attempt over three hundred years earlier.

"The Poemandres of Hermes Trismegistus," in The Journal of Theological Studies, vol. v. No. 19, April 1904 (London) focuses on the Good Shepherd concept.

Menard's sensible view is reflected here.

I haven't encountered this statement before and regret that G. didn't cite his source. If this tradition existed, it would be very insightful. However, Salome, in the fragments we have, states clearly that she has never "given birth."

Even if the "opening chapters" are reduced to the Proem, this doesn't apply.Heracleon, a disciple of Valentinus, comments directly on this Proem but from an independent tradition. He is actually the first commentator we know of. (Reference 40:1, Ibid., p. 412, Thrice-Greatest Hermes, Vol. 1, by G.R.S. Mead, [1906], at sacred-texts.com)

III

THOTH THE MASTER OF WISDOM

This chapter will briefly discuss the nature, powers, and attributes of Thoth (Tehuti), the Master of Wisdom and Truth, based on Egyptian tradition. Since I don’t have enough knowledge of Egyptian, I can't verify the information directly from the texts. However, the information provided will come from experts, mainly from Dr. E. A. Wallis Budge's recent study, who is the keeper of Egyptian and Assyrian antiquities at the British Museum. First, let's see what the German scholar Pietschmann has said about Thoth in his monograph on Thrice-greatest Hermes according to Egyptian, Greek, and Oriental traditions.

The first part of Pietschmann's work, where he traces the concept of Thrice-greatest to an "ibis-headed moon-god," focuses on what he calls the god Tex-Tehuti among the Egyptians. It's unclear why Pietschmann chose this double form of the name for his subtitle. The variants of the name are Teh, Tehu, Tehut, and Tehuti, with the Greek form Thoth being an attempt to transliterate Tehut. There are at least eighteen variants of the name found in Greek and Latin.I would prefer to use the form "Tehut" if it were allowed; however, I'm not entirely sure if it is, since the more common but weaker-sounding form "Tehuti" is usually used by scholars. Since "Tehuti" does not sound very dignified to me, I will use the Greek form "Thoth," which is more familiar to English readers.

According to Pietschmann, Horapollo states that the ibis was the symbol of Thoth as the "master of the heart and reason in all men," although the reason for this remains a mystery among the "sacred animals." Thoth, as the Logos, resided in the hearts of all and was the heart of the world, directing and permeating all things.

The temple, being the dwelling of the God, was seen as a model of the world, and its construction as a replica of the creation of the world. Just as Thoth had established measure, number, and order in the universe, he was also the master-architect of temple-building and all mystical monuments. A text addresses Thoth as follows:

"You are the great, the only God, the Soul of the Becoming."

To assist him in the world, Thoth has a spouse, Nehe-maut, who is considered the Sophia aspect of the Logos among the Gnostics and likely represents Nature in our Trismegistic treatises. Together, Thoth and Nehe-maut initiate all order, rule, and law in the universe. Thoth especially represents the Spirit, the Inner Reason of all things, and is the Protector of all earthly laws and human regulations. A text states:

"His law is firmly established, like that of Thoth."

As the representative of Reason within the world, Thoth is the mediator who brings the world into manifestation. He is the Tongue of Ra, the Herald of Ra's Will, and the Lord of Sacred Speech.The words that come from his mouth become reality; he speaks, and it is his command. He is the Source of Speech, the Vehicle of Knowledge, and the Revealer of Secrets.

Thoth is the God of writing and all the arts and sciences. On a monument of Seti I, he is called "Scribe of the nine Gods." He writes "the truth of the nine Gods" and is known as the "Scribe of the King of Gods and men." Therefore, he is the inventor of hieroglyphics and the patron and protector of all temple archives, libraries, and scribes. At the entrance of one of the halls of the Memnonium at Thebes, the famous "Library of Osymandias," known as "The Great House of Life," Thoth is depicted as "Lord in the Hall of Books."

In the Ebers papyrus, we read: "His guide is Thoth, who bestows on him the gifts of speech, who creates the books, and enlightens those who are knowledgeable in them, and the physicians who follow him, so they may heal." One class of priests focused on healing the body, just as another focused on healing the soul. These books are also called "The Great Knowledge of Thoth." Thus, Thoth was the God of medicine, not so much by drugs but through mesmeric methods and certain "magic formulas." He is addressed as "Thoth, Lord of Heaven, who gives all life, all health."

Moreover, Thoth was also the Lord of Rebirth: "You have given life in the Land of the Living; You have made them live in the Region of Flames; You have placed respect for your counsel in the hearts of men—mortals, intelligences, creatures of light." The Land of the Living was the Invisible World, a glorious Land of Light and Life for the seers of ancient Egypt. Mortals, Intelligences, Creatures of Light were, according to Pietschmann, the "three grades of the Egyptian mysteries."The grades, based on our treatises, can be assumed as follows: (1) Mortals—students in training who were learning the doctrine but had not yet gained inner enlightenment; (2) Intelligences—those who had achieved enlightenment and become "men," meaning they had received the "Mind"; (3) Beings (or Sons) of Light—those who had united with the Light, reaching a state of nirvanic consciousness. This summarizes what Pietschmann tells us about Thoth as the Wisdom-God among the Egyptians.

THOTH ACCORDING TO REITZENSTEIN

In addition to Pietschmann's information, we can refer to Reitzenstein's second important study, "Two Questions in the History of Religion Based on Unpublished Texts from the Strasbourg Library" (Strasbourg, 1901). This study discusses "Creation myths and the Logos doctrine," focusing on specific Creation myths found in an unpublished Greek text. This text presents purely Egyptian ideas in Greek form with Greek god names, making it highly relevant to our current studies.

The author of this cosmogonical fragment was a priest or prophet of Hermes, who plays a crucial role in the creation story. Reitzenstein demonstrates that in the oldest Egyptian cosmogony, the universe is created through the Divine Word spoken by Thoth, who was originally equated with the Sun-god. This allows him to outline the attributes of Thoth in pre-Greek Egypt. However, as Budge covers this topic more comprehensively in his book "Gods of the Egyptians, or Studies in Egyptian Mythology" (London, 1904), vol. i, pp. [p. 52], we will now refer to his work.In the chapter entitled "Thoth (Tehuti) and Maat, and the other Goddesses associated with him," we rely on the most recent specialist work in Egyptology. While other experts may question some of his conclusions, Dr. Budge's data, based on extensive first-hand study of original texts, should be accepted by non-specialists. I will present Dr. Budge's material with my own interpretation of his facts.

THOTH ACCORDING TO BUDGE

In the Hymns to Ra in the Ritual or Book of the Dead and similar works, Thoth and Maat are depicted standing on either side of the Great God in his Boat, indicating their existence was believed to be as old as his. Maat is seen as the feminine counterpart or partner of Thoth, and her name is associated with ideas of Truth and Righteousness—what is right, true, real, genuine, upright, righteous, just, steadfast, and unchangeable.

HIS DIVINE TITLES

From inscriptions of the later dynastic period, we learn that Thoth was called "Lord of Khemennu (Hermopolis), Self-created, to whom none has given birth, God One." He is the great Measurer, the Logos, "He who reckons in Heaven, the Counter of the Stars, the Enumerator of the Earth and of its contents, and the Measurer of the Earth." He is the "Heart of Ra which manifests as the God Thoth." As Lord of Hermopolis, where his main shrine was located, and of his temples in other cities, he was called "Lord of Divine Words," "Lord of Maat," and "Judge of the two Combatant Gods"—Horus and Set. Other titles include "Twice-great" and "Thrice-great." Budge notes that from this last title, the classical writers derived the epithets "Trismegistus" and "Termaximus."We, however, doubt this and prefer Griffith's explanation, as we will discuss later. Besides these divine titles that associate him with the Logos in the highest sense, he was also seen as the Inventor and God of all arts and sciences. He was known as the "Lord of Books," "Scribe of the Gods," and "Mighty in speech," meaning "his words had power," according to Budge. He had the power of the "Spoken Word," a word that led to action and realization. He was said to have authored many of the "funeral works" that helped the "deceased" attain eternal life. However, these books originally were sermons for the living, describing the "death to sin and rebirth to righteousness." In the Book of the Dead, he holds a role with powers greater than those of Osiris or even Ra himself.

Symbols and Name

He is typically shown in human form with the head of an ibis or sometimes just as an ibis. The reason for this symbolism remains a mystery to this day. It is not very useful to list the emblems he carries or the crowns he wears without understanding the hidden meanings behind these symbols. These sacred signs were clear to those initiated into the "Language of the Word"; they revealed the mystery to them, while for others, they concealed their true significance. It has been suggested that Tehuti, the Egyptian name of Thoth, comes from tehu, the supposed oldest name for the ibis in Egypt, with the suffix ti indicating that he possessed the powers and qualities of the ibis.If this is the true origin, considering that Tehuti, in his highest form, is at least a synonym for the Logos of our system, I propose that we should elevate the "ibis" rather than diminish the grand concept of the Logos by associating it with a degraded earthly bird. We should believe that the Egyptians chose it wisely, seeing it as a distant reflection of a Great Bird from the Cosmic Depths, part of the circle of Sacred Animals which the Zodiac signs faintly represent. However, the Egyptians themselves seemed to favor deriving the name Tehuti from "tekh," which usually means a "weight" but is also a name for Thoth. The symbol for "tekh" is the "heart." Additionally, Horapollo (i. 36) states that when the Egyptians want to write "heart," they draw an ibis, adding that this bird was dedicated to Hermes (Thoth) as the Lord of Knowledge and Understanding.

Is it possible that Horapollo was either mistaken or did not reveal everything he knew? Perhaps the Egyptians originally wrote "heart" to represent Thoth, who oversaw the "weighing of the heart." Later, they might have substituted the bird "tekh" or "teknu," which closely resembles the ibis, for the more sacred symbol, due to their love of mystery and wordplay. Today, the most common name for Thoth is Egy. hab, Copt. hiboi, Gk. ibis; and the white ibis (Abu Hannes), known as the Ibis religiosa, according to Liddell and Scott, is one of Thoth's most common symbolic forms. Another common symbol for Thoth is the dog-headed ape. Thus, Thoth is represented by the ibis among birds and the cynocephalus among animals. The main reason for this, as we will see, is that the ibis was considered the wisest of birds and the ape the wisest of animals.In the Judgment Scene of the Book of the Dead, a dog-headed ape (Aan) sits on top of the beam of the Balance where the heart of the deceased is weighed. Its job is to watch the pointer and inform its master, Thoth, when the beam is balanced. Brugsch suggested that this ape is a form of Thoth, representing "equilibrium," and symbolizing the equinoxes, but this doesn't fully explain the ape's significance. 

Thoth, as we know, is the Balancer and "Judge of the two Combatant Gods," Horus and Set. He stands at the junction of Order and Chaos, but this still doesn't clarify the enigmatic dog-headed ape. It might be connected to a specific state of consciousness, reflecting the true Mind, similar to the lion and the eagle (or hawk); it mimicked that Mind better than other animals. 

Horapollo, relying on Hellenistic sources, tells us that the Egyptians represented the equinoxes with a sitting cynocephalus (dog-headed ape). He amusingly explains that at the equinoxes, the cynocephalus urinates once every two hours, or twelve times a day. This tale gives us insight into what the "sacred animal" symbolized in heaven, rather than its actual behavior on earth.

The main center of the Thoth-cult was Khemennu, or Hermopolis, a city notable in Egyptian mythology as the place where Ra rested for the first time after rising.Can I suggest that in this context, we have the mountain from our "Secret Sermon on the Mountain"? 

And that it was in the Thoth mystery tradition of Hermopolis that initiation candidates were taught to ascend the mountain of their inner selves, where the Spiritual Sun would rise and rest upon their heads "for the first time," as Isis mentions in our "Virgin of the World" treatise?

**THOTH AND HIS COMPANY OF EIGHT**

In Khemennu, Thoth was considered the leader of a group of eight deities—four pairs of divine powers, each pair consisting of male and female, positive and negative, active and passive elements. This is the oldest example of the Gnostic Ogdoad. Brugsch proposed this view long ago, and it is now strongly supported by Budge based on textual evidence, contrary to Maspero's opinion, who thought the Hermopolitan group was a copy of the Heliopolitan company that included Osiris and Isis. Budge firmly states that "the four pairs of gods of Hermopolis belong to a much older concept of divine genealogy than the gods of Heliopolis."

If this is accurate, we have a fascinating parallel in the Osirian type of our Trismegistic literature, where Osiris and Isis look up to Hermes (Thoth) as their teacher, considering him far older and wiser. 

The great struggle between Light and Darkness, the God of Light and the God of Darkness, dates back to the earliest Egyptian traditions. The battles of Ra and Apep, Heru-Behutet and Set, and Horus, son of Isis, and Set, are essentially different versions of the same story, though they belong to different periods. The Horus and Set version appears to be the most recent. The names of the Light God and Dark God change, but the name of the Arbiter, the Mediator, remains the same. This Mediator's duty was to prevent either God from achieving a decisive victory and destroying the other.Thoth was the Balancer, responsible for keeping opposites in balance. The Temple of Thoth at Khemennu, also known as the City of Eight, was called Het Abtit, or the "House of the Net." This is an intriguing name. From Chapter 153 of the Ritual, we learn about a mysterious Net believed to exist in the Underworld. The deceased feared this Net, as Budge explains, because they had to learn the names of every part of it—its poles, ropes, weights, small cords, and hooks—to escape it and use it to catch food for themselves rather than being trapped by those who set snares.

From a mystical perspective on the doctrine of Rebirth or spiritual resurrection, this Net symbolizes a condition of the inner nature that confines a person to the limitations of conventional life, separating them from the memory of their true self. The poles, ropes, weights, small cords, and hooks represent the anatomy and physiology of the soul's invisible "body" or "envelope." The average person is trapped by this Net of Fate, while the enlightened person transforms it to sustain themselves. Jesus' call to his disciples, "Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men," implies that the spiritual nourishment provided by Christ comes from people. In a prayer from this chapter of the Ritual, we read: "Hail, thou 'God who looks behind,' thou 'God who has mastered your heart,' I go fishing with the cordage..."Convert the following text into modern English; correct and simplify the text without altering its original meaning:

The text speaks about the "Uniter of the earth" and the one who makes a path through the earth. It addresses the Fishers, who are said to have given birth to their own fathers, laid traps with their nets, and moved through the water chambers. It asks them not to trap the speaker in the same net used for capturing helpless fiends and not to rope the speaker in with the same rope used for binding the wicked fiends of the earth, whose forms reached the heavens and whose weighted parts rested on the earth.

In another chapter, the smaller man speaks to the Great Man within him, asking Ra, who dwells in a divine shrine, to rise and draw in the winds, inhale the North wind, and swallow the beqesu of the net on the day he breathes Maat. "On the day you breathe Maat" implies the intake or inspiration of Truth and Righteousness, akin to the Holy Spirit or Holy Breath, the partner of the Ordering Mind or Logos. The winds likely represent the four major cosmic currents of the Divine Breath, with the North wind being the "down-breath" of the Great Sphere. The term beqesu remains undeciphered (possibly meaning knots?), but swallowing the Net suggests transforming it by inwardly digesting it so that the lower becomes one with the higher. This idea of a net is ancient, especially in its macrocosmic sense, as seen in the Assyrian and Babylonian stories of the battle between the Sun-god Marduk and the Chaotic Mother Tiamat, and her titanic, demonic forces of disorder and instability. Both Egyptian and Babylonian traditions likely stem from a common ancient source. Marduk is described as setting lightning before him and filling his body with burning fire.He created a net to trap Tiamat's insides, setting the Four Winds—South, North, East, and West—to ensure nothing could escape. He positioned the winds around the net that his father Anu had given him.

In the hymns of the popular Hermes cult found in the Greek Magic Papyri, one common way to address Hermes is "O thou of the four winds." Additionally, we can compare the rope the Fishers use to capture evil spirits on earth with a passage from Athenagoras. He tells us about the Mysteries, where the myth says that Zeus, after dismembering his father and taking the kingdom, chased his mother Rhea, who rejected his advances. She transformed into a serpent, and Zeus did the same, binding her with the "Noose of Hercules" (also called the Herculean knot) and joined with her. The symbol of this event is Hermes' Rod. The Caduceus represents balance between opposing forces; it is the power of Thoth that binds and unbinds, holding the keys to heaven and hell, life and death. Athenagoras is clearly referencing a Hellenistic form of the Mysteries influenced by Egypt. The "Noose of Hercules" is likely the "Noose of Ptah." Ptah is the creator and generator, and his "Noose" or "Tie" is probably the Ankh, or symbol of life, often depicted as a twisted rope representing the union of male and female life. Ptah is also the God of Fire, similar to Hephaistos in Greek mythology, who trapped Aphrodite and Ares in a net he cleverly designed, causing the gods on Olympus to laugh.In the list of titles of the many works belonging to the cycle of Orphic literature, one is called The Veil (Peplos) and another The Net (Diktyon).

During the Panathenaea, the renowned Peplum, Veil, Web, or Robe of Athena, the Goddess of Wisdom, was carried like the sail of a ship; this was a symbol of the Mysteries. Mystically, it represented the Veil of the Universe, adorned with stars, the multi-colored Veil of Nature, the famous Veil or Robe of Isis that no mortal has lifted. This Veil symbolized the spiritual nature of a person, and to lift it, one had to transcend individuality, break the bonds of death, and become consciously immortal. Eschenbach correctly associates this Veil with the famous Net of Vulcan. Aristotle, quoting the Orphic writings, mentions the "living creature born in the webs of the Net," while Photius notes that the book of Dionysius Aegeensis, titled Netting, or Concerning Nets (Diktyaka), discussed the generation of mortals. Plato himself compares the intertwining of nerves, veins, and arteries to the "network of a basket" or a bird-cage.

All this suggests that Thoth’s Temple of the Net had a deeper significance than simply being a building where a net or its emblem was venerated, as Budge weakly theorizes.

THOTH THE LOGOS

To continue, we have seen that Thoth was considered the "heart" and "tongue" of Ra the Supreme. This means he was not only the reason and mental powers of the god Ra, and the means by which they were spoken, but also the Controller of life and the Instrument of the Supreme Will's expression. He was the Logos in the fullest sense of the term, the Creative Word.He is the one who speaks the "words" that carry out the Will of the Supreme, and his speech represents Necessity and Law. His "words" are not the weak words of human language but the commanding orders of the Creative Will. "He spoke the words that resulted in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and he taught Isis the words that allowed her to revive the dead body of Osiris, enabling Osiris to father a child with her. He also gave her the formulas to bring her son Horus back to life after he was killed by a scorpion." All of this, I believe, symbolically refers to the mystery of resurrection, powered by the Logos. "Osiris" must die to be resurrected and to father a son, who is himself, through a spiritual immaculate conception. "Horus" must be poisoned to death by the scorpion of "Typhon" before being revived by the pure waters of Life. THE WORDS OF THOTH

Thoth's "knowledge and abilities measured the heavens and planned the earth and everything in them. His will and power maintained the balance of forces in heaven and earth. His skill in celestial mathematics correctly applied the laws (maat) that formed the foundation and maintenance of the universe. He directed the movements and seasons of the heavenly bodies, and without his words, the gods, whose existence depended on them, would not have maintained their place among the followers of Ra—they would have likely vanished into another universe. Thoth is the Judge of the dead, the Recorder and Balancer of all "words," the Recording Angel; for the testing of the soul in the Hall of Osiris is called the "weighing of words" and not of "actions."The "words" referred to were not the spoken words of a man, nor even the reasons he thought he had for his actions, but rather the deepest intentions of his soul and the ways of his will. This doctrine of "words" as expressions of will had both moral and magical applications. The power of prayer seemed to depend on the manner and tone in which the words were spoken. Thoth taught these powerful words and how to utter them; he was the master of what Hindus call mantra-vidya, the science of invocation or sacred chanting. In ancient Egypt, as in modern India and other places where such knowledge is valued, these mantras were believed to be especially effective in influencing the "bodies" and conditions of the fluid nature that exists between the solidity of the physical world and the fixed nature of the mind.

These "words" were connected to the vital "breath" and its knowledgeable use. They were only truly effective when the spoken words matched naturally in their vowels and consonants, or their fluid and fixed elements, with the inner elements of Nature. Only then were they considered true or authentic "words-of-power," compelling matter to shape itself according to true cosmic principles. In a book called The Book of Breathings, it is stated: "Thoth, the mighty God, the Lord of Khemennu, comes to you and writes The Book of Breathings for you with his own fingers. Thus, your soul shall breathe forever, your form shall be endowed with life on earth, and you shall be made a God, along with the souls of the Gods. They shall be the heart of Ra for you, and your members shall be the members of the Great God."### Thoth and the Osirified

In the Ritual, we learn about the services that Thoth performs for "Osiris," which actually means for those who have become like Osiris, as he performs these services for every person who has been acquitted in the Judgment. Among several significant passages cited by Budge, we present the following one as the most understandable and therefore the most important for us. It is found in Chapter 183 and is spoken by the one being resurrected into an Osiris:

"I have come to you, O son of Nut, Osiris, Prince of everlastingness. I follow God Thoth, and I have rejoiced at everything he has done for you. He has brought you sweet air for your nose, and life and strength for your beautiful face, and the North wind from Tem for your nostrils. He has made God Shu shine upon your body; he has illuminated your path with rays of splendor; he has removed all the evil defects from your body with the magical power of his words. He has made the two Horus brothers be at peace for you; he has calmed the storm wind and the hurricane; he has made the Two Combatants gracious to you, and the two lands at peace before you; he has taken away the anger from their hearts, and they have reconciled with each other."

### Thoth the Measurer

Budge further describes Thoth's attributes related to time periods and the instruments of time, such as the sun and moon. As Aah-Tehuti, Thoth is the Measurer and Regulator of times and seasons. He is not just the Moon-god, even though Budge claims he is. Thoth as Aah is the "Great Lord, the Lord of Heaven, the King of the Gods"; he is the "Maker of Eternity and Creator of Everlastingness." Therefore, he is not only the Aeon but its creator, which is vastly different from being just the Moon-god.### The Title "Thrice-Greatest"

On page 401, our source tells us that one of Thoth's titles is "Thrice-great," and that the Greeks derived the title Trismegistus from this. However, on page 415, it adds: "The title given to him in some inscriptions, 'three times great, great' [that is, greatest], from which the Greeks derived the name Trismegistus or 'ter maximus,' has not yet been satisfactorily explained, and the exact meaning assigned by the Egyptians is still unknown." If this title is indeed found in the texts, it would resolve a long-standing controversy, as it has been strongly denied that it ever appears in the hieroglyphics. Unfortunately, Dr. Budge does not provide any references. Our esteemed Egyptologist notes that valuable information on this subject has been collected by Pietschmann in a book we have already mentioned. However, we have not found any valuable facts in Pietschmann that clarify the term Thrice-greatest; we will revisit this issue in another chapter.

### The Supremacy of Thoth

The unique supremacy attributed to Thoth by the Egyptians has been well demonstrated. As the great authority to whom we owe much says in his concluding words: "It is clear that Thoth held a unique position in their minds, different from any other god. The attributes they ascribed to him were unlike most of those of any other gods. The character of Thoth is a lofty and beautiful concept, and perhaps the highest idea of deity ever formed in the Egyptian mind, which, as we have seen, tended to focus on the material side of divine matters."Thoth, as the embodiment of the Mind of God and the all-encompassing power governing heaven and earth, is a central figure in Egyptian religion. This belief is as profound as the idea of resurrection in a spiritual body and the doctrine of eternal life. Thoth is the Logos of God, becoming the Supreme Master of Wisdom in relation to humanity.

We now turn to a scholar with views considered unorthodox by conservative critics who focus only on the physical aspects of hieroglyphics. This scholar, in my view, has come closer to the truth and is highly regarded by enthusiasts of Egyptian mysticism.

The latest work by W. Marsham Adams deserves the attention of every theosophical student. While we may not fully agree with his detailed interpretations, particularly regarding the Great Pyramid, the value of his work lies in his intuitive understanding of the mystery cults derived from ancient texts, especially the Ritual or the so-called Book of the Dead, a name given by Lepsius that remains in use. According to Adams, the Egyptian priests called it The Book of the Master of the Secret House, with the Secret House being the Great Pyramid, also known as the "Light."### The Spiritual Nature of the Inner Tradition of Egyptian Wisdom

In his preface, the author clearly states that he sees Egyptian Wisdom as a major influence on some key teachings of early Christianity. This view is strongly supported by a careful study of Trismegistic literature and its sources, which will become evident as we proceed with our work. Before quoting from the former Fellow of New College, Oxford, whose recent death is mourned by all who appreciate Egyptian Wisdom, we must raise an issue. Mr. Adams has significantly limited the value of his work for scholars by failing to include necessary references to the texts he cites. This omission is a major flaw, and we would not be able to quote Mr. Adams were it not for our own Trismegistic literature, which strongly supports his view on the spiritual nature of Egyptian Wisdom's inner tradition. However, it is important to note that our author has not covered the same ground. He does not mention the Thrice-greatest one and seems unaware of our treatises.

Mr. Adams claims to have reached his conclusions solely from Egyptian texts and has been confirmed in his ideas by personally inspecting the monuments. He believes it is a waste of time to pay attention to Greek writings about Egyptian ideas, criticizing their "distortion and misrepresentation when filtered through the imaginative but unobservant Greek intellect." Thus, we have a writer addressing the same problem from a completely different perspective. While we consider the Greek tradition of Egyptian Gnosis to be highly valuable for understanding the Mind of Egypt, Mr. Adams reaches very similar conclusions through a different approach.**The Sacred Land of Egypt and Its Initiates**

The sacred land of those who had departed from the physical body, nourished by the Celestial Nile—the River of Heaven, which the earthly Nile symbolized—was divided into three regions or states: (1) Rusta, the Territory of Initiation; (2) Aahlu, the Territory of Illumination; and (3) Amenti, the Place of Union with the Unseen Father.

"In ancient Egyptian religion, the visible world was seen as a counterpart to the unseen world. This belief was not just a vague idea of life after death, but a detailed path showing how the righteous, once they leave the tomb, move through stages of Initiation, Illumination, and Perfection to prepare for an eternal union with Light, the Great Creator."

We learn that in Aahlu, the Territory of Illumination, the purified soul, called the Osirified, achieves the "Passage of the Sun"—meaning it has transcended the mortal mind. The soul opens the Gates of the Celestial Nile and receives the Atf-crown of Illumination, "shaped like the Zodiacal light, the glory of the highest heaven." This is likely the "crown of lives" mentioned in our sermons, which the soul receives in the realm called "Eight," and with which it goes to the Father.The guide and leader through all these stages was Thoth, the Eternal Wisdom. We are told that:

THOTH THE INITIATOR

"Thoth, the Divine Wisdom, clothes the spirit of the Justified a million times in a garment of true linen. This linen, with its purity and brilliance, is like the rays of light with which the sun covers the earth each day as it rotates. Similarly, the soul of a person is given new radiance each time they turn to their Creator." Additionally, in the harmony of the universe, the Egyptians saw "the Eternal Wisdom, Thoth, as the Mind and Will of God."

Pietschmann believes that Thoth, the God of Wisdom, is simply the ibis-headed moon-god, indicating that the Great Initiator originated from primitive ideas. However, Thoth was the Great Reckoner, the Recorder of Justice, and the Teller of the Karmic Scales. For the Egyptians, the moon was the timekeeper. The moon's motion relative to the sun takes about an hour to cover a space equal to its own disc. The 'Hour' was sacred in Egypt; each of the twenty-four hours during a day was dedicated to a specific deity, twelve of light and twelve of darkness. In the Ritual, when in the Hall of Truth, the adept is asked to "explain the God in the hour," which was Thoth, the 'Lord of the Moon and the Reckoner of the Universe.'

In relation to moon phases, the first day of the lunar month was called "the conception of the moon," the second its "birth," and so on until it was full.The time for all lower initiations was during the full moon. In the temple of Denderah, lunar representations on the walls show fourteen steps leading up to the fifteenth and highest step, where Thoth, the Lord of the Moon, is enthroned.

Thoth was called Lord of the Moon for reasons beyond the moon itself inspiring the idea of Thoth. The origins of the Wisdom-tradition should not be sought in its lower symbols. An inscription on the coffin of Ankhnes-Ra-Neferab, who was known as "the Sacred Heart of Ra," reads: "Your name is the Moon, the Heart of Silence, the Lord of the Unseen World." This inscription refers to the space up to the moon, or the "sublunary region," which is the first state after death where souls are purified from earthly stains.

The goal for the initiate was illumination, and the whole cult, discipline, and doctrines emphasized this path to Wisdom. Egyptian religion was fundamentally a Religion of Light. Most characteristic was the powerful sense of the fatherhood of God, which gave Egyptians a familiar and sometimes joyous view of death. The priests' sense of the divine personality and their ultimate union with the personal deity (the Logos) contributed to the mystery surrounding their religion.

Light was seen as the Father of the Religion of Illumination, and Life, his consort, was the Mother of the Religion of Joy. Life was central, encompassing all that was good. Life was the symbol of power in Amen's hand and the greatest gift of Osiris. The sage Ptah-Hotep, in what might be the oldest known document, advised, "Do not be ungrateful to your Creator, for he has given you life.""I am the Source of Light," says the Creator in the Ritual. "I cut through the Darkness. I make the Path clear for everyone; the Lord of Joy." Similarly, the seeker prays to the setting sun: "O pinnacle of Love, you open the double gate of the Horizon."

Here, we see the complete doctrine of Light and Life, which is the main theme of our writings. Additionally, the doctrine of the endless turning of the spheres, which "end where they begin," as "The Shepherd" says, is evident in the great fourth year festival of Hep-Tep or "Completion-Beginning," when "the revolution and the rotation of our planet were simultaneously finished and started anew."

TEMPLES OF INITIATION

We can believe that the ancient initiation temples in Egypt were models of the Higher Wisdom, or the "Heavenly Jerusalem," a term used by Jewish Gnostics, meaning they represented the archetype of world creation. This makes the observations of Adams on the temple of Denderah (or Annu) particularly interesting. The temple was rebuilt several times following ancient plans and was an important center of the mystery cult. It was dedicated to Hat-Hor, whose ancient title was the Virgin-Mother. "In the center of the temple is the Hall of the Altar, with entrances opening to the east and west. Beyond it lies the great hall of the temple called the Hall of the Child in his Cradle, from which access is gained to the secret and sealed shrine, entered once a year by the high priest on the night of mid-summer."

There were also various other halls and chambers, each with a unique name, mostly referring to the Mysteries of light and divine Birth. These names include: Hall of the Golden Rays, Chamber of Gold, Chamber of Birth, Dwelling of the Golden One, and Chamber of Flames.The famous planisphere of Denderah, a wall painting moved from the temple to Paris in the early 1800s, includes the northern and southern points. This allows us to match parts of the picture with different sections of the temple and find a notable correspondence between the inscription and the names of the chambers and halls.

The planisphere features names for the halls and chambers such as: Horus, the Entrance of the Golden Heavens, the Golden Heaven of Isis, Horizon of Light, Palace Chamber of Supreme Light, and Heavenly Flame of Burning Gold. The main hall of the temple is called the Hall of the Child in his Cradle, and similarly, the main image on the planisphere is the holy Mother holding the divine Child.

THE MYSTERY OF THE BIRTH OF HORUS. The great mystery of Egypt was the second birth, the "Birth of Horus." In "The Virgin of the World," a fragment of the lost Trismegistic treatise "The Sacred Book" preserved by Stobaeus, Isis tells Horus: I will not reveal this birth; I must not, mighty Horus, disclose the origin of your race, lest humanity learns the generation of the Gods. We know the nature of this rebirth from our treatises. However, despite such clear hints, the mystery of the Golden Horus remains unrevealed. In another part of the same book, Isis states that the sovereignty or kingship of philosophy belongs to Harnebeschenis. According to Pietschmann, this Egyptian name could be either Hor neb en xennu (Horus the Lord of Xennu) or Hor nub en xennu (the Golden Horus of Xennu). His symbol was the golden hawk, which flies closest to the sun and looks at it without blinking, representing the newly enlightened "man."Indeed, says Adams, "throughout the sacred texts of Egypt, no doctrine is mentioned more frequently than that of a divine birth."

To understand the Birth of Horus, the theosophical student might consider the stages described in the following passage by our author:

"In Egyptian teachings, a radiant being, capable of attaining divine glory in its renewed life, was surrounded by the 'khaibit,' or luminous atmosphere. This atmosphere consisted of ethereal layers that both shaded and spread its bright light, similar to how the Earth's atmosphere affects sunlight. With each transformation (Ritual, chapters 77-87), it moved closer to the conditions of humanity. Starting from the form of a golden hawk, symbolizing the divine essence of the eternal, self-existent being, it becomes the 'Lord of Time,' representing the Creator, since time began with creation. 

Next, it takes the form of a lily, depicted in the Ritual as the head of Osiris within the flower, symbolizing the divine manifesting in pure flesh. 'I am the pure lily,' it says, 'emerging from the lily of light. I am the source of illumination and the bearer of immortal beauty. I deliver the messages that Horus fulfills.' Later, the soul transforms into the form of the uraeus, 'the soul of the earth,' and finally, it takes the form of a crocodile, symbolizing subjection to human passions. These passions, part of human nature from the beginning, are not inherently evil but become so when they dominate the soul."

In addition to being worshipped as the Source of Light and Life, the Deity was also revered as the Fountain of Love."I am the Source of Joy," says the Creator in the Ritual. When the Atf-crown of enlightenment is placed on the head of the victorious candidate after completing the "Passage of the Sun," the hymn announces that "north and south of that crown is Love." Into this Love, the initiate was introduced through the Secret Scroll, which is named in one copy: "This Book is the Greatest of Mysteries. Do not let anyone see it--that would be a violation. 'The Book of the Master of the Secret House' is its name."

The entire doctrine in its chapters teaches Light and Life. But were most people truly educated in this wisdom? It was common to include some chapters of this Secret Scroll with almost every mummy. I believe there are three stages in the use of this scripture and the decline from knowledge to superstition seen in Egyptian history. First, there was genuine instruction and initiation during life; second, the teachings were recited over the uninitiated dead to help their souls in the afterlife; and third, chapters of the Book of the Master were buried as a talisman to protect the dead, long after the true meaning of the sacred words was lost, though they were still superstitiously seen as magical "words of power." Reciting some chapters over the dead was not just superstition but a powerful form of "prayers for the dead." After death, a person was in conscious contact with the unseen world, even if they had been skeptical of its existence or unprepared to understand it while alive.After the soul was freed from the body's prison, even those who were not initiated could be guided on the path they had to travel. Since they couldn't properly pronounce the sacred words, the initiated priest would recite or chant them.

**The Steps of the Path**

The teachings in those mystical writings explained the journey of the Just. When freed from the flesh, they passed through stages of spiritual growth: entering the light, learning wisdom, the second birth of the soul, instruction at the Well of Life, the ordeal of fire, and judgment. Ultimately, they became united with the Great Creator, adorned with the jewels of immortality.

However, this should not be taken literally, even for the initiated, and certainly not for the uninitiated. In mystical schools, knowledge was communicated in three ways: through simple instruction, distant vision, or personal participation. There are many phases of being, many steps on the great ladder, each reflecting a higher phase. For example, the solemn address by the "Gods in the House of Osiris," followed by the response of the "Gods in the House of Glory," and the joyous song of the holy departed before the judgment seat, echoed by their loved ones who have entered the fullness of life, indicates several stages.For example, when a man's consciousness normally unites with his higher self after fulfilling his spiritual aspirations in the intermediate heaven, it symbolizes the merging with the "those-that-are" from "The Shepherd" treatise. This represents the harvest of his past lives that are worthy of immortality. There are also higher unions, such as the initiated achieving unity with the "pure mind" or the Master joining with the nirvanic consciousness, leading to even greater Glories. Upon initiation, the newly enlightened individual, "clothed in power and crowned with light," revisits the places of his former weaknesses to understand, through his enlightened perception, how it is 'Osiris who balances the heavens.' He then uses his creative will with freedom, no longer a slave to the senses, and finds joy in the suffering that led to his Illumination and Mastery.

However, he must still ascend higher, beyond the earth, planets, and even the sun, across the vast and unfathomable depths to the distant Sothis, the Land of Eternal Dawn, to reach the Ante-chamber of the Infinite Morning.

AN ILLUMINATIVE STUDY

We could quote many other beautiful and interesting passages from Marsham Adams' illuminative study, but what has been said is sufficient for our purpose. The Wisdom of Egypt was undoubtedly the main source of our treatises. Even if only a small fraction of what Adams wrote is true, our case is proven. And if Egypt did not teach this Wisdom, then we must acknowledge Mr. Adams as the creator of one of the most grandiose religions of the universe.The student of inner nature understands that this is not an invention. Even if he is also a scholar and regrets that Mr. Adams didn't include his references, he must let the critics decide. They must either say that our author has made everything up, thus praising his genius, or admit that ancient texts have inspired Mr. Adams's ideas. If this is just a glimpse of what Egypt has preserved for us, who knows what future studies and interpretations might reveal!

Was Lazarus raised as a 'mummy' wrapped in grave-clothes?" In this context, it is interesting to note Tertullian (De Corona, viii.; Oehler, i.Referring to the "linen cloth" Jesus wore in John 13:4-5 as the "proper garment of Osiris" implies that the proper garment of Osiris at one point likely consisted of symbolic linen wrappings of a "mummy."

The title seems to appear only in the latest version of the twenty-sixth Saite dynasty—the time of King Ammon—but no better title can be suggested.

THE POPULAR THEURGIC HERMES-CULT IN THE GREEK MAGIC PAPYRI

THE "RELIGION OF HERMES"

At one time, the "Religion of Hermes" was not only widespread but almost dominant in popular Hellenistic circles. This can be seen from the many magic papyri that have been preserved and made accessible by diligent scholars like Leemans, Dieterich, Wessely, and Kenyon. The Greek Hermes prayers, along with many others of a similar kind, are clearly elaborations of older types and are strongly syncretistic. In these prayers, we can see popular forms based on ancient Egyptian magic traditions, which reflect the philosophical and theosophical ideas presented in our Trismegistic literature with clear and dignified simplicity.As we now understand that the so-called "Gnostic" Abraxas and Abraxoid amulets, gems, and rings were part of popular magical practices and not truly connected to Gnosticism, we can also be confident that the circles of high mysticism, who refused to offer even the pure sacrifice of incense and believed that only "prayers and praises of the mind" were worthy for God, had no direct involvement with the popular Hermes prayers, theurgical invocations, or the consecration of amulets. However, these invocations remain interesting and can provide insights into the higher teachings and practices that transformed external rites into inner spiritual discipline.

The following prayers, which I believe have not been previously translated, are taken from the latest revised texts by Reitzenstein, who has removed the magic names and improved earlier editions. I think these texts deserve a more thorough analysis. They seem to show similarities to the recensions of the Book of the Dead, suggesting that fragments from a greater past tradition have been reworked for a lesser age. The Trismegistic schools aimed to restore the memory of that greater past, which had been forgotten and turned into superstition rather than a living faith, and degenerated magic instead of powerful theurgy. The theurgy in our prayers is like that of dwarfs compared to the giants of the past.

### I. AN INVOCATION TO HERMES AS THE GOOD MIND

(From revised texts: R. 15-18; Leemans, Papyri Graec. Mus. Ant. Pub. Lug. Bat. (Leyden, 1885), II. 141, 14 ff., and V. 27, 27 ff.; Dieterich)1. Come to me, O you of the four winds, almighty one, who breathes life into men;

2. Whose name is hidden and beyond human speech, no prophet can pronounce it, and even demons tremble upon hearing it!

3. O you, whose tireless eyes are the sun and moon, shining in the pupils of human eyes!

4. O you, whose head is the heavens, body the aether, feet the earth, and the ocean surrounds you! You are the Good Daimon, father of all things good, and caretaker of the world.

5. Your eternal dwelling place is above.

6. The good influences of the stars, those daimons, fortunes, and fates, who give wealth, good nature, good children, good fortune, and a good burial, are yours. For you are the lord of life,

7. King of heavens and earth and all that inhabit them;

8. Your Righteousness is never dismissed, your Muses sing your glorious name, and the eight Wardens guard you, the possessor of pure Truth!

9. Your Name and Spirit rest upon the good.

10. May you enter my mind and heart for all my days, and fulfill all my soul's desires!

11. For you are I, and I am you. Whatever I speak, let it be so, for I have your Name to protect me in my heart.

12. And no serpent shall harm me, nor shall any spirit, demon, plague, or evil from the Unseen World oppose me, for I have your Name within my soul.I call upon you; come to me, Good One, entirely good, come to the good— you who cannot be enchanted or controlled by magic— who grants me good health, safety, abundance, good reputation, victory, strength, and a cheerful spirit!

Make my opponents lower their eyes, and grant me favor in all my actions!

II. AN INVOCATION TO LORD HERMES

1. Come to me, Lord Hermes, as babies come into the wombs of women!

2. Come to me, Lord Hermes, who gathers the food of gods and men!

3. Lord Hermes, come to me and grant me grace, food, victory, health, happiness, a cheerful spirit, beauty, and power in the eyes of all!

4. I know your Name that shines in heaven; I know your forms; I know your tree; I know your wood.

5. I know you, Hermes, who you are, where you come from, and what your city is.

6. I know your names in the Egyptian language, and your true name as it is written on the sacred tablet in the holy place in Hermes' city, where you were born.

7. I know you, Hermes, and you know me; I am you, and you are me.

8. Come to me; fulfill all that I desire; be favorable to me with good fortune and the blessing of the Good.

III. AN INVOCATION TO LORD HERMES

1. Come to me, Lord Hermes, you of many names, who knows the secrets hidden both beneath the heavens and under the earth!

2. Come to me, Lord Hermes, you benefactor, who does good for all the world!Listen to me and grant me favor with everyone on earth. Open the hands of all who give like you and make them give me what they have. Just as Horus, when he called on you, the greatest of all gods, in every trial and place, against gods, men, spirits, and all living things in water and on earth, received grace and riches from gods, men, and all living things beneath the earth, let me also receive grace, form, and beauty when I call on you.

Hear me, Hermes, doer of good deeds, inventor of all incantations, and speak good words to me. Hear me, Hermes, for I have done everything I should for your black dog-ape, lord of the underworld. Soften everyone towards me, give me power and form, and let them give me gold, silver, and all kinds of food continuously. Protect me forever from spells, deceits, witchcraft, evil tongues, and all forms of hostility from gods and men. Give me grace, victory, success, and satisfaction. For you are I, and I am you; your name is mine, and mine is yours, for I am your likeness.

Whatever happens to me this year, month, day, or hour, it will also happen to the Mighty God, whose symbol is on the holy vessel's prow.

AN INVOCATION TO THOTH AS LOGOS

I invoke you alone, who brings order to gods and men, who transforms into holy forms, creating from nothing and turning existence into non-existence. Holy Thoth, whose true face no god can endure to see!Make me present in every creature's essence—wolf, dog, lion, fire, tree, vulture, wall, water, or whatever you desire, for you have the power to do so.

An Invocation to Hermes as the Spiritual Light

1. I invoke you, the creator of all, who transcends everything, the self-born God who sees and hears all but is seen by none.
2. You gave the sun its glory and power, the moon its waxing and waning, and set their courses. You did not diminish the powers of darkness, which are more ancient than the sun and moon, but made them equal to it.

3. When you shone forth, the Cosmos came into being, and light appeared, and everything was ordered through you; thus, all things are under your command.
4. O you, whose true form none of the gods can see, who transforms into all of them in visions seen by men, O Eternity of eternities.

5. I invoke you, O Lord, so that your true form may appear to me, for I am in servitude below your world, a slave to your angel and your power.

6. Through you, the pole and earth are fixed.
7. I invoke you, O Lord, just as the gods you made to shine, so they may have their power.

These prayers provide striking examples of the popular Hellenistic form of the Hermes religion in its theurgic phase. In this belief system, Hermes is regarded as the Mind or Logos. The Mind is invoked to enter the mind and heart. With the shining of the Mind, the Spiritual or Intelligible Light shines forth in the world and in man. The Mind thus guides souls. It is also identified with the Good Daimon (of whom Chnuphis or Horus are variants), the Great Ocean, the Heaven-Space or Celestial Nile, the Great Green, the Light, and the Aeon.In relation to the above invocations, Reitzenstein provides the text of an interesting ritual of lower theurgy, known as the rite of the sacred flame. He describes this as "the mystery of lychnomancy or lamp-magic." This is a simpler form of the profound visions mentioned in "The Shepherd of Men" treatise and the following passage from Pistis Sophia (pages 272, 373):

"Jesus said to his disciples: Come to me!" 

[p. 93]

They approached him. He turned to the four directions of the world, spoke the Great Name over their heads, blessed them, and breathed on their eyes. "Jesus said to them: Look and see what you can see!" 

They lifted their eyes and saw a great Light, incredibly vast, which no one on earth could describe. "He said to them again: Gaze into the Light, and see what you can see!" 

They said: We see fire, water, wine, and blood." VI. THE MYSTIC RITE OF THE FLAME 

[Revised text, R. 25-27. Wessely, "Griechische zauberpapyrus von Paris und London" (Vienna, 1888), 68, 930 ff.] (a) Invocation to the Light 

1. I invoke you, O God, the living one, who shows your splendor in the fire, unseen Father of the Light! Pour forth your strength; awaken your spirit, and come down into this fire; inspire it with your holy spirit; show me your power, and let the house of the almighty God, which is within this light, be opened for me! Let there be light,--

[p. 94]

your breadth-depth-length-height-ray; and let the Lord, the God within, shine forth! (b) A Stronger Form to be used if the Flame dies down

2. I adjure you, O Light, holy ray, breadth-depth-length-height-ray, by the holy names I have spoken, and am now about to speak... stay with me in this hour, until I have sought your God, and learned what I desire! (c) The Theagogy or Invocation of the God proper 

3. I invoke you, mightiest God and Master...You who enlighten everyone and spread your light across the world with your power, O God of gods! 

O Word (Logos) who orders night and day, guiding the ship and holding the helm, dragon-slayer, Good Holy Spirit...! 

The East and West praise you as you rise and set, blessed by all gods, angels, and spirits! 

Come and show yourself to me, O God of gods!

Enter and reveal yourself to me, O Lord; for I invoke you like the three apes who symbolically call your holy Name.

In your ape form, enter and appear to me, O Lord; for I call your mightiest names!

You who sit on the heights of the cosmos and judge all, surrounded by the sphere of Surety and Truth!

Enter and appear to me, O Lord, for I existed before the fire and snow, and will exist after them;

I am the one who has been born from heaven.

Enter and appear to me, O Lord of mighty names, whom everyone holds in their hearts, who breaks open rocks and moves the names of gods!

Enter and appear to me, O Lord, who has power and strength in fire, who has a throne within the seven poles.

And on your head is a golden crown, and in your hand a staff with which you send forth the gods! 

Enter, O Lord, and answer me with your holy voice, that I may clearly and truthfully understand this thing!

If the above invocation fails, here is a stronger form of adjuration:

He enjoins you, the great living God, who is eternal, the shaker and thunderer, who creates each soul and every birth. Enter and appear to me, O Lord, joyful, kind, gentle, glorious, free from all wrath; for I adjure you by the Lord of all!

When the presence of the God is manifested:

Hail Lord, O God of gods, benefactor...! Hail to your glories forevermore, O Lord!### The Farewell to the God

18. Thank you, O Lord. Depart, O Lord, to your heavens, your realms, and your path, keeping me healthy, safe from all harm, free from fear of any spirit, free from all punishments and distress, listening to me for all the days of my life!

### The Farewell to the Flame

19. Depart, holy ray; depart, beautiful and holy light of the highest God! In connection with this, we also use the following ritual-prayer for consecrating an amulet ring.

### A Prayer of Consecration

1. I invoke you, greatest God, everlasting Lord, ruler of the world, above and below the world, mighty ruler of the sea;

2. You who shine at dawn, rising from the East for all the world, and setting in the West!

3. Come to me, you who rise from the four winds, joyous Good Spirit, for whom heaven is a place of celebration!

4. I call upon your holy, mighty, hidden names which you love to hear.

5. When you shine, the earth sprouts anew, the trees bear fruit when you smile, the animals give birth when you look upon them.

6. Grant glory, honor, grace, fortune, and power!

7. I invoke you, the great in heaven, O dazzling Sun, who spreads your beams over all the world!

8. You are the mighty serpent, the chief of all gods, you who possess Egypt's beginning and the end of all the world!

9. You are the God who sails over the ocean; you are the God who appears every day.

10. O you who are above the world and beneath the world, mighty ruler of the sea, listen to my voice this day, this night, these holy hours, and through this amulet let the purpose for which I consecrate it be fulfilled!Here's a modern English version of the provided text, simplified and corrected for clarity while preserving the original meaning:

P., appendix, 282. ^84:4 Compare Lactantius, i. 6 (Fragment II); and especially iv. 7 (Fragment VI). ^84:5 The "eyes and light of Horus," according to Plutarch in "On Isis and Osiris," chapter 52; mystically referring to the higher and lower "self" and much more. ^84:6 en tais korais—compare the discussion on the meaning of the title of our treatise, commonly translated as "Virgin (kore) of the World," in the commentary. ^84:7 Refers to the Ocean of Space, the "Great Green" of the Ritual. ^84:8 Meaning the father-mother of the universe. ^84:9 kumasterion—meaning heaven. See VII. 3 below. ^84:10 aporroiai—meaning personified influences. See Plutarch, "On Isis and Osiris," chapters 38, 53, 58; and especially "Pistis Sophia," where it appears frequently. Compare also K. K., 1; Stobaeus, p. 405, 17 (W.). ^85:1 eykerasia—apparently referring to the composition of "body" and "soul." ^85:2 Referring to the Pleroma or Aeon (see VI. 9 below). Reitzenstein (p. 18) rightly notes, as we have seen, that Egyptologists have long recognized that the god identified with Agathodaimon was originally the Hermes or Thoth of Hermopolis Magna, Lord of the Eight Wardens (the Ogdoad), symbolized by apes, praised by the Muses (possibly the Nine or Ennead), and spouse of Isis-Righteousness (cf. Plutarch, "On Isis and Osiris," chapter 3). ^85:3 See 13 below. ^85:4 Compare the extra-canonical saying: "I stood on a high mountain and saw a giant man, and another, a dwarf; and I heard a voice like thunder, and approached to listen; and He spoke to me and said: I am you, and you are me; and wherever you are, I am there. I am scattered in all things [that is, the Logos as seed or "parts"], and wherever you wish, you gather me; and gathering me, you gather yourself." (From the Gospel of Eve, quoted by Epiphanius, Heresies, chapter 26.3). Cf. II. 7. ^85:5 In the Egyptian sense—meaning your true "self" or "presence." See R. 17, note 6, for many references to this fundamental concept of Egyptian religion.Here is the simplified and modernized version of the text:

**^85:6** "Phylactery" originally means an amulet. For more information on the Egyptian origin of Jewish phylacteries, see R. 18, note 8.

**^86:1** "Drax" symbolizes any hostile elemental force. Compare with K. K., Stob., 402, 22 (W.).

**^86:2** "Kath' Aidoy" is mentioned here.

**^86:3** See note 9 above.

**^86:4** "Abaskantos, abaskantos."

**^86:5** "Suterian" means salvation.

**^86:6** See II. 2 below.

**^86:7** Compare this prayer for the descent of the Mind into the heart with the ascent of the man into the Mind in C. H., xiii. (xiii.) 3.

**^86:8** This echoes spiritual rebirth or regeneration.

**^86:9** In its highest sense, this refers to heavenly food or wisdom, the "supersubstantial bread," or "bread of life."

**^87:1** "Epafrodisian prosw'poy." See I. 13 above.

**^87:2** The symbols are: the ibis in the east, ape in the west, the serpent in the north, and the wolf or jackal in the south. The text suggests the wolf might actually be a dog.

**^87:3** The terebinth, or turpentine palm. Compare with the story of Terebinthus, whose four books Manes is said to have used for his system, according to the Acta Archelai.

**^87:4** The ebony, possibly symbolizing "dark" wisdom or initiation "in the black" in the K. K. Fragments.

**^87:5** "Ta barbarika onomata" means non-Greek names.

**^87:6** See I. 11.

**^87:7** Literally, with Agathodaimon. Compare with "sun theui"—"with God's blessing."

**^88:1** "Syndukontun" is a unique term. It can be compared with "dw'ku" (give) and "ste'ku" (stand). The image might be from the symbol of the sun sending out rays with hands for giving and blessing, seen in the frescoes of the Aten-cult period. See K. K., 11 and 31.

**^88:2** In the mystery-myth.

**^88:3** Originally means medicines or love potions.

**^88:4** "Eydialektos genou" is a unique and awkward Greek phrase, difficult to translate into English.

**^88:5** This likely refers to Anubis, the "dog" of Hades or the "death-genius," attendant of Thoth. "Black" is literally "Ethiopian."In Pistis Sophia, page 367, "Aethiopic Ariouth" is mentioned as a ruler among the infernal demons who is "entirely black." The Ethiopians were known for their sorcery and black magic. They were the traditional opponents of the "white magicians" of Egypt. This is comparable to "Hor, son of the Negress" in the "Second Story of Khamuas," found in Griffith's Stories of the High Priests of Memphis (Oxford, 1900), pages 51 and following.

This text is not necessarily a prayer for physical form, but rather a prayer that the subtle ka, or the plastic soul-substance, of a person may take a powerful and beautiful form in the unseen world. The term "eidulon" refers to an image or double. The theurgist is trying to associate his ka with that of the god. It is believed that the consecrated statue of the god was "animated" with this ka. This idea is discussed in P.S.A., and the "image" or "likeness of God" in Lactantius, ii. 10.

According to the Egyptians, a person possessed: (1) a physical body (khat); (2) a soul (ba); (3) a heart (ab); (4) a double (ka); (5) an intelligence (khu); (6) a power (sekhem); (7) a shadow (khaibit); (8) a spiritual body (sah); and (9) a name (ren). Refer to Budge, Gods of the Egyptians, volume ii, pages 299-300. These elements are not arranged in any particular order, and their precise meanings are not fully understood. Budge writes that the sekhem is closely related to the body but has undefined functions. It has been translated as "power," "form," and "vital force." Ultimately, the glorified body in heaven, which includes the soul, spirit, power, and name of the deceased, is called sahu.

Thoth and Maat are depicted sitting on either side of Ra in his boat. Hermes is referred to as the cosmic Logos. Thoth changes his form in every heaven-space or sphere.Compare Chapter 1, Section 13 of the Corpus Hermeticum, and also similar ideas in various Gnostic systems where Christ conceals himself in the forms of his servants throughout his descent. See also Chapter 11, Section 16 of the Corpus Hermeticum. Footnote 3: This refers to essence or possibly a type. Footnote 4: Likely a symbol for air. Footnote 5: Likely a symbol for earth. Footnote 6: Compare Chapter 11, Section 20 of the Corpus Hermeticum and Section 6 of the Poimandres. 

For the Egyptians, darkness was the ultimate mystery. As Damascius wrote in "On First Principles": "The Egyptians said nothing about the first principle but described it as an incomprehensible darkness, a thrice unknown Darkness." Refer to my book "Orpheus" (London, 1896), page 93, and for "Night," pages 154 and 170 onward. This might provide some insight into the initiation "in the black" mentioned in the K. K. excerpt. "Dark wisdom" was the most hidden of secrets. Footnote 2: In another hymn, Hermes, as the Logos, is called "Cosmos of cosmos," meaning the spiritual world or order. Footnote 3: This refers to the spiritual cosmos, or cosmos of the Mind. Footnote 4: Compare Isaiah 45:7: "I form the light and create darkness: I make peace and create evil: I the Lord do all these things." See also Chapter 1, Section 23 of the Corpus Hermeticum: "the avenging daimon"; and Section 15: "Within the Harmony he has become a slave." Footnote 5: Known in Hermetic literature as the "Religion of the Mind" (Mentis religio). See Section 25 of the Poimandres. 

Compare the creation story in Dieterich's "Abraxas," sections 17 and 43: "Through the Bitterness of God, Mind appeared... that restrains the heart, and was called Hermes."Compare the phrase "Bitterness of God" with the "Bitter Chaos" mentioned at the end of the J. source of the Naassene Document in "The Myth of Man" chapter. Also, consider the "Bitter Water" or Chaos in the Sethian System (Hippolytus, Philosophumena, v. 19). Julian, in Oration V., writes: "The oracles of the gods say that through purification, both our soul and body are deemed worthy of great help and preservation, as it is said: 'the mortal vesture of bitter matter is preserved.'" Could the "Bitterness" in Jacob Bohme's writings be a reflection of ancient Gnosis?

For pure Egyptian parallels, refer to R. 24, note 1. See the theogony in Dieterich's work (p. 18, 75): "And the soul came into being. And God said: 'Thou shalt move all things... Hermes guiding thee.'" Compare with Corpus Hermeticum, x. (xi.) 21: "But on the pious soul, the Mind ascends and guides it to the light of Gnosis;" also xii. (xiii.) 12, ix. (x.) 10, iv. (v.) 11, vii. (viii.) 2.

I have added these rubrics following Reitzenstein's example, but not his wording.

Compare the phrase "Jesus the living [one]" often found in the Introduction to the "First Book of Ieou" (Carl Schmidt, Gnostic Writings in Coptic Language from the Codex Brucianus, Leipzig, 1892, pp. 142-145—reprinted with his recent translation of the Pistis Sophia in Volume I of his Coptic Gnostic Writings, Leipzig, 1905); and also the Preface to the newly discovered sayings: "These are the words which Jesus, the living [one], spoke" (Grenfell and Hunt, New Sayings of Jesus, London, 1904).

Compare also the frequently repeated phrase "Father of all fatherhood, Boundless Light" in the same writings.

Refer to Dieterich, Jahrbuch für Philologie, Supplement, xvi. 802, 171, and 706. Also, compare Ephesians iii. 18 and the Valentinian interpretation of the terms in this text as given by Hippolytus, Philosophumena, vi.The interpretation of the Light Hymn in Pistis Sophia, 146, associates "height" with the "home" of the Light (Dunker and Schneidewin, p. 248). The magic names of power are omitted, as in other prayers. Horus is often depicted as the pilot of the sun-ship during its journey across the ocean of space, the "Great Green." The dragon likely symbolizes darkness. Consider C. H., i. 4.

The term "kynokefalos" might symbolize an idea where the ape is to man as this great elemental is to the God. It literally means "seated on the head of the cosmos." This refers to Eternity or Aeon, also known as the Pleroma or "fullness of grace," and is associated with Agathodaimon (see prayer, R. 30). Refer to Wessely, op. cit., 185 (R. 362) and compare John 1:14, "full of grace and truth," and 1:16, "Of his fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace."

The regenerate, or spirit-born, refers to "virgin-birth" or the "birth of Horus." Compare this to the soul's declaration upon entering the unseen world after death, found in an inscription in the tomb of an Orphic or Pythagorean initiate at Petilia, in what was once Magna Graecia: "Of Earth and starry Heaven child am I; my race is of the Heavens!" (See Inscr. Gr. Siciliae et Italiae, 638; and my "Notes on the Eleusinian Mysteries," Theosophical Review, xxii. 317.)

These are the logoi hidden in the hearts of all. This could be a figurative expression praising the power to dissolve the most stable things on earth and move the center of spiritual essences' stability. Alternatively, it might refer to the idea of the "God born from the rock," familiar from the Mithraic mystery-tradition, where the rock symbolizes the "firmament," considered solid or rigid by the ancients. This refers to the seven cosmic spheres.**Memnoinen**—an untranslatable term. Is it Egyptian? Or is it meant to be **Memnoneian**? If it’s the latter, it might relate to the Egyptian myth and the cult of Memnon (see Roscher's Lexikon, coll. 2661 ff.). The Memnon cult was somehow associated with Hermes, as even in the early third century, "statues of Hermes" were still visible in the temple ruins, according to Philostratus (Vit. Apoll., vi. 4). He also mentioned that the Memnon statue acted like a lyre struck by the rod (pleiktron), which means a ray (e aktis) of the sun (Imag., i. 7). Therefore, "the rod [of power], by which you send forth the gods," referring to your rays, with each god being a ray of the spiritual sun, might be called Memnonian. However, due to the current lack of information, this interpretation seems very stretched. ^96:2 **Doxai**—here means powers. ^97:1 **Aneiduloplekton**. ^97:2 **Kumasterion**. Cf. I. 5 above. ^98:1 The serpent symbolized the Logos, the underlying idea of the so-called Ophite systems of Gnosis. ^98:2 This refers to the first nome of Upper Egypt, where Elephantine was the main center of the popular Agathodaimon cult (R. 29, n. 4). The "world" here refers to the Egyptian civilized world, beyond which lay the darkness of Ethiopia.

**THE MAIN SOURCE OF THE TRISMEGISTIC LITERATURE ACCORDING TO MANETHO, HIGH PRIEST OF EGYPT**

**HERMES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE HELLENISTIC PERIOD**

The closer interaction between Greek thought and Egyptian mysticism began during the brilliant era of the Lagides, who gradually turned Alexandria into the intellectual, religious, philosophical, and scientific center of the Hellenistic world.Thoth-Hermes, from the earliest times, was the Egyptians' teacher of all ancient and hidden wisdom. He was the main author of all sacred writings and the scribe of the gods. So, we would expect his influence to be significant in new developments, which is clearly shown in the religious art of that time. This art includes statues of the Greek Hermes with either the feather of truth (Maat's symbol) on the head or a papyrus roll in the hand—both symbols of Thoth as a revealer and scribe.

The complex nature of the mystical and apocalyptic literature that emerged is well-documented. Following its Egyptian roots, it was all shaped in a theological and philosophical way, whether discussing physics, medicine, or astrology. For example, Pamphilus, the grammarian, knew about a Greek-Egyptian literature on "sacred plants" and their powers influenced by the thirty-six Decans. He said this knowledge came from the "Books ascribed to the Egyptian Hermes."

PETOSIRIS AND NECHEPSO

Even more interesting are the Greek fragments of Petosiris and Nechepso that have survived. These fragments date to at least before the end of the second century B.C. and show strong similarities with the Trismegistic literature we have. In these fragments, the Prophet Petosiris is depicted as the teacher and advisor to King Nechepso, similar to how Asclepius advises Ammon in our texts. Hermes reveals secret wisdom to two younger gods, Asclepius and Anubis, just as he does to Asclepius and Tat in our writings. Regarding Petosiris, Suidas (s.v.) says...He was an Egyptian philosopher who wrote about Greek and Egyptian theology, selecting from "Holy Books," and discussing astrology and Egyptian Mysteries. Proclus tells us that Petosiris had deep knowledge of all orders of Gods and Angels. He mentions a hieratic formula by Petosiris for invoking the greatest goddess, Necessity, and the ritual for addressing her when she appeared. The mystical nature of this literature is further illustrated by Vettius Valens, who tells us about Nechepso, an exceptional figure in sacred literature, who achieved direct knowledge of the Inner Way.

Vettius, writing in the first half of the first century A.D., laments that he did not live in those times when kings, rulers, and sages dedicated themselves to Sacred Science. Back then, the clear Aether spoke openly to them, revealing holy mysteries without holding back. Their love for these mysteries and their high virtue allowed them to transcend earthly bounds and become "heaven-walkers" and knowers of divine things.

Vettius quotes from Nechepso's Greek apocalyptic treatise, where the King describes spending the night in contemplation, gazing into the aether. In this ecstatic state, he left his body and heard a heavenly Voice, which was not just a sound but appeared as a substantial presence guiding him through the heavens. It is very likely that the magnificent vision of the star-spheres Vettius refers to as "the most transcendent and most blessed vision" was described in the same source.We can compare this to Trismegistus's wish for Tat to gain the wings of the soul and enjoy a beautiful vision, and Hermes seeing it through the Mind.

This shows that there were Greek books in the middle Ptolemaic period discussing the same topics as our Trismegistic literature. 

When Egypt came under the rule of Alexander's successors and the Ptolemies made Alexandria a center of Greek learning by founding the famous Museum, Library, and Schools, there was a great enthusiasm for translating, paraphrasing, and summarizing the old scriptures and records of other nations into Greek. The most famous translator and compiler was Manetho, who introduced the treasures of Egyptian mysticism, theology, mythology, history, and chronology to the Greek world. 

Manetho's reliability as a historian is increasingly accepted as we learn more from ancient monuments. He lived during the last years of the fourth century and the first half of the third century B.C., contemporary with the first two Ptolemies. He was a priest of Heliopolis (On) and was well-versed in both Greek culture and ancient Egyptian wisdom. Manetho wrote not only on historical subjects but also on the mystic philosophy and religion of Egypt. It is likely that Plutarch and others drew their information on Egyptian subjects from Manetho's works.Manetho got his information from hieroglyphic inscriptions in temples and other priestly records. Unfortunately, most of his books are lost, and we only have fragments quoted by later writers.

One important quotation for our current investigation is preserved by Georgius Syncellus, who cites a now-lost work by Manetho called "Sothis." The passage, introduced by Syncellus, goes as follows:

"We will make a few extracts about the Egyptian dynasties from Manetho's books. Manetho, being the high priest of the temples in Egypt, based his responses to King Ptolemy on monuments found in the Seriadic region. These monuments, he says, were originally written in the sacred language and script by Thoth, the first Hermes. After the flood, they were translated into the common language of that time but still written in hieroglyphics and stored in books by the son of the Good Daimon and the second Hermes, father of Tat, in the inner chambers of Egyptian temples.

In the Book of Sothis, Manetho addresses King Philadelphus, the second Ptolemy, personally, writing as follows:

"The Letter of Manetho, the Sebennyte, to Ptolemy Philadelphus.

To the great King Ptolemy Philadelphus, the venerable: I, Manetho, high priest and scribe of the holy temples in Egypt, citizen of Heliopolis but originally from Sebennytos, send greetings to my master Ptolemy.

We must calculate everything you wish us to examine and answer your questions about what will happen to the world."According to your instructions, I will show you the sacred books written by our ancestor, Thrice-Great Hermes, which I study. My lord and king, farewell.

THE IMPORTANCE OF MANETHO'S STATEMENT IN HIS "SOTHIS"

This is a quote from a document supposedly written before 250 B.C. It is one of several letters exchanged between Manetho and Ptolemy II. Ptolemy has learned about Egypt's past from its records and asks if the priests can predict the future. Manetho replies that they can, but it requires many calculations. Ptolemy also wants to see the documents from which Manetho got his information, and the high priest agrees to show them. These books are attributed to Hermes, the Thrice-Great, marking the first time this title appears in surviving Greek literature. Manetho explains that this Hermes is the second one, the father of Tat, and the son of the Good Spirit (Agathodaimon), who was the first Hermes. This outlines the hierarchy in our texts: (i) The Shepherd of Men, or The Mind; (ii) Thrice-Great; (iii) Tat. This represents the distinction between student and teacher, and the Master of masters.

If we look for historical references, we might conclude that the first Hermes, or the first priesthood in Egypt, used a sacred language that was no longer spoken by the time of the second Hermes, or second priesthood. This language was likely ancient Egyptian. The two lines of priests and prophets were separated by a “flood.” This flood might be related to the one Solon heard about from the priest of Sais, which occurred about nine thousand years before his time. We have detailed information about this flood in Plato's Timaeus and Critias.The Good Angel is the same as the Mind, according to the Trismegistic literature, and was considered the father of Hermes Trismegistus. This seems to symbolically suggest that ancient Egyptian civilization before the flood, likely caused by the sinking of the Atlantic Island, was highly advanced. This era was known as the time of the Gods, Divine Kings, or Demi-Gods, whose wisdom was passed down through mystic traditions. This wisdom was revived by the lesser descendants of that race, who either returned from exile or were reincarnated to lead the new populations that resettled the lower Nile plains after the floodwaters receded. 

Thus, we have three periods of Egyptian mystery traditions: 
1. The first Thoth or Agathodaimon, the original tradition preserved in sacred language and stone monuments, presumably from Egypt before the Atlantic flood.
2. The second Thoth, the Thrice-greatest, representing the mystery school after the great flood, with records and doctrines preserved not only in inscriptions but also in manuscripts, written in the sacred character but in the contemporary Egyptian language as spoken after the people resettled.
3. Tat, the priesthood of Manetho's era, and likely some centuries earlier, who spoke a later form of Egyptian, from which further translations or paraphrases were made in Greek.

Is "Sothis" a Forgery? This natural progression of fundamental doctrines in the Trismegistic tradition is dismissed by encyclopedism, which claims our sermons are Neoplatonic forgeries, though we have seen that their evidence is weak. It will now be interesting to examine how Manetho's testimony is handled.Our encyclopedias tell us that the book Sothis is clearly a late forgery, repeating this claim without providing any evidence. Let's see if any scholars outside of encyclopedias have tackled this issue. Very little research has been done on this topic. The most comprehensive summary is by C. Muller, who bases his claim on Bockh, who in turn relies on Letronne.

The arguments are as follows:
1. The term "venerable" (sebastos) wasn't used before the Roman emperors.
2. Egypt has no record of a flood.
3. Ancient Egyptian mythology doesn’t mention a first and second Hermes.
4. There is no Seriadic land in Egypt.
5. The term "Trismegistus" is a later addition.

Let's examine these arguments in order, keeping in mind that the question has been biased from the beginning. Encyclopedias argue that Manetho's Sothis is fake to maintain their stance on the inauthenticity of Trismegistic writings. Manetho’s clear statements challenge this hypothesis.

1. The term "sebastos" is later equated with "Augustus," the title of Roman emperors. It's argued that it couldn’t have been used before their time. But why not? To Egyptians, the king was divine—every inscription shows this—and "venerable" was always used for the gods. Why not use it for the "Great King"? It's a natural extension.

2. Plato shows that Egypt had accurate knowledge of a flood. He says Solon learned this from the priests of Sais, who kept all records in the temple of Neith.This is not the place to delve into Plato's Atlantis and the extensive history of opinions surrounding it, as that would require an entire book. However, I have familiarized myself with all the arguments for and against the authenticity of at least the core of this tradition, as well as the issues in comparative mythology and folklore involved. I've also reviewed recent literature that aims to support Plato's main ideas through seership research. This, combined with the general subject of Plato's "myths" and the latest perspectives on them, has convinced me that the greatest Greek philosopher was serious when, after exhausting his dialectic, he turned to mystery traditions to support the intuitions his intellect alone couldn't prove. It can, of course, be argued that every mention of a flood in Egyptian Hellenistic literature is just a repetition of what skeptics must see as Plato's brilliant fiction. However, it is equally arguable that all these references—including Plato's—originate from the same source: Egypt itself. In fact, on November 9, 1904, at a meeting of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, a paper by Professor Naville was read by Mr. F. Legge about "A Mention of a Flood in the Book of the Dead." The flood in question is described in the Leyden version as Chapter 175.

Cicero (106-44 B.C.) mentions five Mercurii, the last two of whom were Egyptian. One was the "son of Father Nile," whose name the Egyptians considered it impious to pronounce, so they presumably called him Agathodaimon instead. The second was the later Thoth, the founder of Hermopolis.Cicero likely didn't come up with this idea on his own; it was probably a common belief at the time, originally from the writings of Manetho. The Greeks and those influenced by Greek culture usually got their information about Egypt from Manetho. Even Reitzenstein, despite attributing the information given by Syncellus to a Pseudo-Manetho without much explanation, acknowledges that the genealogy of Hermes presented there is mostly old.

THE SERIADIC LAND

The claim that Egypt had no Seriadic land or country seems quite strong, but the following points might offer a different perspective. In Egyptian astronomy, the solar system nearest to ours, symbolized by the bright star Sirius, was of utmost significance. Important cycles were based on it, and it played a crucial role in the highest levels of Egyptian mysticism. Sirius was essentially Egypt's guardian star. Ancient Egypt was considered a sacred place, organized into provinces that mirrored the heavens, with centers in Egypt corresponding to centers or ganglia in the sky. Just as the Hindus had a Heavenly Ganges (Akasha-Ganga) and an earthly Ganges, the heavens had a Celestial Nile, and Egypt had a physical Nile, which was the lifeline of the land. The annual flooding of the Nile, critical for both ancient and modern Egypt, was meticulously observed and recorded, with its cycle based on Sirius, known in Greek as Sothis and Seth. Given this, calling the country the Seriadic Land makes perfect sense.In ancient times, the Nile's records were documented using pyramids, obelisks, and temples. Later, most monuments were built based on the tools of Egyptian astrogeological science. This science has been studied recently by an Egyptian scholar, whose findings are privately published and available in the British Museum. In the Preface, the author states:

"Astrogeological science led to a system of monuments that preserved accumulated human knowledge, outlasting writings, inscriptions, traditions, and nations. The main monuments became timeless markers of geological history. They recorded astronomical, geographical, and earth measurement knowledge from their eras using hydromathematics. These were known as Siriadic monuments because their main lines were scaled to the cycles of the star Sirius using the standard astrogeological cubit." 

While the author may overstate his theory, nilometry and related sciences were crucial to ancient priestly knowledge.

THE STELAE OF HERMES

Before addressing the final objection to the authenticity of Manetho's Sothis, let's discuss the Seriadic monuments known in antiquity as the Stelae of Hermes or Seth, often mistakenly referred to in Latin and English as the "Columns" or "Pillars" of Hermes.The average reader might be confused by the different spellings of the star's name, but it's important to remember that translating from one language to another is always challenging, especially when the languages are from different families. For example, the Egyptian name for Hermes, Tehuti, appears in at least nineteen different forms in Greek and two in Latin, such as Thoyth, Thath, Tat, and so on. Similarly, the name of the famous Indian lawgiver is transliterated into English as Manu, Menu, Menoo, and others. Regarding the "Mercurii Columnae," it was commonly believed that Pythagoras, Plato, and others derived their wisdom from these columns, meaning monuments.

The historian Ammianus Marcellinus, a friend of Emperor Julian, has shared an interesting detail about some of these pyramids or temples. He describes:

"There are certain underground galleries and winding passages, which, it is said, the ancient practitioners (knowing a flood was coming and fearing the loss of sacred ceremonies) built in various places inside the buildings, with great effort. They engraved the walls with numerous types of birds and animals, and countless otherworldly creatures, which they called hieroglyphic characters."

This gives us insight into another feature of some Seriadic monuments and the "Books preserved from the Flood," which were mentioned in many traditions. These are the records referred to by Sanchuniathon and Manetho.### The Sons of Seth-Hermes

The Egyptian account is straightforward enough, but when Josephus, in line with the traditional practice of his people to incorporate myths from older nations into Jewish history—examples of which are numerous in the Mosaic Books—mistakenly identifies the Egyptian deity Seth (Sirius) with the Biblical patriarch Seth, he enters the realm of fiction rather than history. He thus uses the Egyptian Seriadic tradition for his own purposes:

"All of these [the Sons of Seth] were of good character, living peacefully in the same country, free from conflicts or misfortunes until the end of their lives. Their primary focus was the study of astronomy and the orderly arrangement of the heavenly bodies. To ensure their discoveries were not lost to humanity, as Adam had predicted alternating destructions by fire and flood, they created two monuments: one of brick and one of stone. They engraved their findings on both monuments. This way, if the brick monument was destroyed by heavy rains, the stone one would survive and inform future generations of their discoveries, also indicating that a brick monument had once existed. This stone monument still stands today in the land of Siriad."

This passage is particularly interesting as it not only exemplifies the method of creating Jewish "antiquities" but also allows us to discern the original outlines of the Egyptian account that Josephus adapted. The Sons of Seth were the initiates of the ancient priesthood of the First Hermes.Adam has replaced the First Man in the sense of our "Shepherd" tradition. Josephus seems to see the two types of monuments as single structures rather than different classes of buildings. These might refer to the brick structures and temples of that time, as well as more durable stone monuments, like rock-cut temples or the oldest pyramids. I’ve wondered if there’s a hidden clue in the "brick monument" reference about the puzzling statement in the Babylonian Talmud that Jesus set up a "brick-bat" and worshipped it. According to the Talmud Jeschu Stories, Jesus "learned magic in Egypt," and ancient Egyptian magical knowledge was recorded on brick monuments.

Reitzenstein (p. 183) notes the similar traditions about the Seriadic Land in Josephus and what he calls Pseudo-Manetho. He adds that an inscription confirms the Seriadic Land as the native home of Isis, who is also called Neilotis or Seirias. She represents the fertile earth and is Egypt.

Now, let's address the arguments against the authenticity of Manetho's Sothis. Regarding objection (iv), we have shown strong reasons to conclude that rather than Egypt "not knowing the Seriadic land," Egypt was indeed the Seriadic Land, and the Books of Hermes were directly descended from its ancient stone monuments. Furthermore, our Trismegistic writings are a continuation of that same tradition. This logically and naturally fits together, effectively countering four out of the five arguments suggesting the Sothis document is a forgery.Let's now see if the remaining support can hold up the structure. The title "Thrice-Greatest" is under review.

We are informed that the term "Trismegistus" is a relatively recent term. This claim is based on the idea that all existing writings attributed to Trismegistus are actually Neoplatonic forgeries from the third or second century. Before this time, the name Thrice-Greatest was supposedly unknown. However, the term Trismegistus must date back to the earliest of these writings, and we'll determine that timeline at the end of our investigation. It's clear that the unique title Trismegistus was known in the first century, even among the Romans, as evidenced by the famous Latin poet Martial (v. 24). He praised a gladiator named Hermes with the line:

Hermes omnia solus et ter unus.

An anonymous translator in 1695 freely translated this as:

Hermes encompasses all men's gifts in one, 
And alone deserves the name Trismegistus.

This popular reference indicates that the name Trismegistus was well-known and had been in use for many years before Martial's time (A.D. 43-104?). But do we have other evidence? 

On the famous Rosetta Stone, which praises Ptolemy Epiphanes (210-181 B.C.), Hermes is called the "Great-and-Great." Letronne translates this as "twice great" and notes that the term "Trismegistus" was not known at that time. He argues that if it had been known, it would certainly have been used instead of the weaker expression "great-and-great." But why is this so certain? Let's investigate further. The Egyptian duplicated form of this attribute of Hermes, aa aa, meaning "great-great," is often found with a prefixed sign that can be transliterated as ur.So, if the simpler form is translated as "great, great," the intensive form would naturally be "great, great, great," or "three times great." However, we are dealing with the term "thrice-greatest," a superlative form. In Greek, we have many examples of adjectives intensified with the particle tris, but no early examples of their superlatives. This suggests that the term "Trismegistus" is a later invention. 

Might we not assume, lacking further information, that when the Egyptian intensified his repeated form, it was the highest level of greatness he could express in his language? Not so with Greek, which is more flexible. He could go further in Greek. So why didn't he use "thrice-greatest" instead of "great-and-great" on the Rosetta Stone? Because he was translating aa aa and not its intensified form. But why didn't he use the intensified form in the demotic inscription? There could be many reasons; perhaps, as Ptolemy was being praised for his justice, which he exercised "as Hermes the great-and-great," the repeated form was enough for this particular attribute of the idealized priesthood, while the more honorific title was reserved for Hermes as the personified Wisdom. Or, it might have been wise to avoid adjectives that could overshadow Ptolemy’s greatness.

I wrote this in November 1899 when the main part of this chapter was first published in The Theosophical Review. Shortly after, I found a new clue. In his book "Stories of the High Priests of Memphis: the Sethon of Herodotus and the Demotic Tales of Khamuas" (Oxford, 1900), F. Ll.Griffiths provides a translation of a very interesting demotic text found on the back of two Greek documents. These documents are official land-registers from the seventh year of Claudius (A.D. 46-47). There is strong evidence suggesting the demotic text was written within thirty years of that date. 

What about the content of this text? Since it belongs to an important cycle of Egyptian folk tales, it is likely that its form and substance are ancient. The papyrus tells a story about a time of great need when the Pharaoh of Egypt was being attacked from afar by Ethiopian sorcerers. He was saved, and the magic was sent back to the Ethiopian enchanters, by a man named Hor, son of Pa-neshe, who was very knowledgeable in magical texts. Before his great confrontation with the Ethiopian spells, it mentions that Hor:

"Entered the temple of Khmun; he made offerings and libations before Thoth, the Eight-times-great, the Lord of Khmun, the Great God."

Griffiths adds a note explaining that "Thoth, eight times great" appears here for the first time in Egyptian literature. This title is equivalent to "trismegistos" (thrice-greatest), a later term. Thoth, often called "great and great" on the Rosetta Stone, probably means "greatest". Thus, "eight times great" can be seen as trismegistos, showing a mathematical progression. The famous title of Hermes, which has puzzled scholars, is thus explained mathematically.The equation 6o = 3(2a) does not fill the gap on the papyrus, nor does it reference Thoth's city, 'the Eighth,' or the mythological meaning of that name. The name Khmun (Khemen-nw), which Budge transliterates as Khemennu, is interpreted by Griffiths as "the eighth city," meaning the eighth city in Upper Egypt along the river.

We hesitate to deny anyone such a fitting adaptation to the physical interpretation, but our readers likely already know that Khemennu was the City of the Eight, the City of the Ogdoad, and will expect a more mystical explanation of the name. We don't entirely object to Khemennu being the "Eighth City up the River," if that river is seen as the Celestial Nile, where the soul of the initiated sailed in the solar boat. Reitzenstein is mistaken in thinking that Griffiths connects the title Trismegistus with the eight cynocephali who are part of Thoth’s group; but we might make that connection. The symbolic nature of this Ogdoad is clearly shown in the inscription at Der-el-Bahari, from the Twenty-second Dynasty, recently published by Maspero.

In it, the Osirified says to the Supreme:

"I am One who becomes Two; I am Two who becomes Four; I am Four who becomes Eight; I am the One after that." Similarly, in the first Hermes Prayer mentioned in an earlier chapter, addressed to Hermes as Agathodaimon, Thoth is "guarded by the Eight Wardens." These Eight, we might speculate, were generated as follows: Two from One, Greatest; Four from Two, Twice-greatest; Eight from Four, Thrice-greatest. Such a combination would appeal to those trained in Pythagorean mathematical symbols, many of whom likely contributed to Egyptian Hellenistic theosophical literature.I conclude that the honorific title "Thrice-greatest" likely dates back to early Ptolemaic times. Therefore, in my view, the authenticity of Manetho's "Sothis" remains unchallenged by any current arguments. I consider Syncellus's quotation to be valuable for tracing the origins of Trismegistic literature. Whether any of our existing sermons belong to these early forms will be discussed later.

EARLIEST TRISMEGISTIC LITERATURE

From the material presented earlier in this chapter, we know that similar literature existed in early and middle Ptolemaic times. We can conclude that from later Ptolemaic times up to the first century A.D., this literature includes examples of cosmogenesis resembling the main elements in our "Shepherd" treatise. A notable example is the fragmentary cosmogonical poem printed by Reitzenstein in his "Zwei religionsgeschichtliche Fragen," which we previously mentioned. Reitzenstein dates this poem to the first century B.C., though it may be older. The poem claims to be part of the Hermes tradition, stating that Hermes, the Beloved Son of Zeus, is the Logos-Creator of the cosmos and the father of the prophet-poet who writes the vision.PHILO BYBLIUS

The Egyptian Hermes tradition not only influenced Greek cosmogony from Alexandria but also shaped the cosmogonies and historical writings of other nations. A notable example is the Phoenician Histories by Philo Byblius, who lived in the latter half of the first century A.D. The fragments of this work are significant to our study, as they suggest that both Egypt and Phoenicia, two highly revered cultures, obtained their cosmogonical knowledge and mystery traditions from the same source—the ancient Books of Thoth. This appears to be an adaptation of Phoenician records influenced by Egyptian tradition. However, Philo claims his work is a Greek translation or paraphrase of a compilation by an ancient Phoenician priest named Sanchuniathon, who based it on old Phoenician records and was knowledgeable in his own oral traditions.

The question of whether Philo had a genuine Phoenician document is not our primary concern here, as we are focused on the Egyptian elements of his account, not on unraveling the native Phoenician aspects. It is fair to note that although Philo introduces his account and includes occasional comments, these are clearly his own additions and can be easily distinguished from what seem to be translated passages.

ARE HIS "PHOENICIAN HISTORIES" A FORGERY? Since the time of Orelli, the prevailing theory has been that Philo might have fabricated this entire cosmogony and history.On the contrary, Porphyry made significant use of it in his criticism of Christianity, and Eusebius quotes the passages Porphyry used. Wagenfeld claims to have recovered the entire work of Philo and has vigorously defended its authenticity. There seems to be no reason to accept the forgery hypothesis, which appears to be even less credible than the forgery theory of the Trismegistic writings. Instead, the work, seen as an example of Phoenician stories influenced by Egyptian tradition, is a fascinating document for understanding ancient Semitic mystery traditions, distinct from Jewish adaptations of general Semitic legends—that is, the distinction between Semitism and Israelitism. Porphyry, being a Semite and a good critic, would unlikely base his arguments on a forgery. Philo wouldn't have dared to present a forgery with so many learned and passionate Jews ready to expose it. Philo tells us that Phoenician public traditions were chaotic, and "Sanchuniathon, a man of great learning and a diligent seeker of knowledge who especially wanted to understand the first principles of everything, carefully examined the Books of Taaut. He knew that Taaut was the first under the sun to discover the use of letters and writing. So he started from him, making him his foundation—from him, the Logos, whom the Egyptians called Thouth, the Alexandrians Thoth, but whom the Greeks turned into Hermes."### SANCHUNIATHON AND THE BOOKS OF HERMES

This clearly means that Sanchuniathon's information about the mystical beginning of things came from the Books of Thoth. This can be seen from the following passage:

He believes that the origin of everything began with a Dark Mist of a spiritual nature, like a Breath of dark mist, and a chaotic, dark, boundless state similar to Erebus. These conditions existed without limits for many ages. But when the Spirit fell in love with its own principles, they mixed together, and this merging was called Love. This Love was the beginning of all creation. However, Chaos did not understand its own creation. From its union with the Spirit, Mot was born. From Mot, the Great Mother, came the seeds of all creation, leading to the birth of all cosmic bodies.

Initially, there were Great Lives without sensation, and from these eventually came Great Lives with intelligence. These intelligent beings were called Zophasemin, meaning "Overseers of the Heavens." They were shaped like eggs and shone as Mot, the Sun and Moon, the Stars, and the large Planetary Spheres.

As the original nebula began to lighten, heat produced mists and clouds of sea and earth, leading to massive downpours and torrents of water in the sky. Even after being separated, these waters and earth elements were moved from their places by the sun's heat and met again in the nebula, clashing together with thunder and lightning. The Great Rational Lives watched over these events while male and female beings on land and sea cowered at the echoes and were afraid.Our author continues by saying: "We found these things written in the Cosmogony of Taaut and in his commentaries, based on his research and the evidence he discovered, which he then shared with us."

Philo's translation has many interesting points, but we won't go into detail here. However, one important point related to the Hermes-Aesculapius tradition, which is significant in the Trismegistic writings, must be mentioned.

"Cronus [Ammon] went to the land of the South and gave all of Egypt to the God Taaut as his kingdom. These events were first recorded by the Seven Sons of Sydyk, the Cabiri, and their eighth brother, Asclepius, as commanded by the God Taaut."

Aesculapius is immediately linked to the cult of the "Great Gods" (Kabirim), who, according to old Semitic tradition, were the Sons of King Sydyk (possibly Melchizedec). The ancient mysteries of these Great Gods are extremely fascinating, but we should not be sidetracked. 

It is clear that both Sanchuniathon and the writer of "The Shepherd" based their cosmogony accounts on the same sources, namely, the "Books of Thoth," or the Egyptian mystery tradition.^101:5 Boe'—likely a parallel to the Bath-kol in Talmudic Rabbinism. ^102:1 The same ecstatic vision of the soul after death is translated by Seneca (Cons. ad Marciam, 18, 2) from Poseidonius (135(?)–51 B.C.), who also likely drew from Egyptian Hellenistic literature. ^102:2 C.

The next year, Wagenfeld published the Greek text with a Latin translation titled Sanchoniathonis Historiarum Phoeniciae Libri IX. (Bremen, 1837). For more on the reliability of Sanchuniathon, see Count (Wolf Wilhelm) Baudissin's Studies on the History of Semitic Religions, vol. 2, "On the Religious Historical Value of Sanchuniathon's Phoenician History" (Leipzig, 1876). ^124:1 Possibly attempts to transliterate the dialectal variants of Upper and Lower Egypt for the name Tehuti. ^124:2 Wagenfeld's text, Introduction, p. 2; Eusebius, Preparation for the Gospel, I. ix. 29. ^125:1 This marks the beginning of the universe's out-breathing or any system; it is the Great Breath or Spirit moving on the Waters of Chaos, the primal nebula.

This union was symbolized not only among the Phoenicians but also among most other nations by an egg, around which a serpent twines. When the egg and serpent are shown separately, they represent "Chaos" and "Ether," matter and spirit; but when united, they symbolize the hermaphroditic or male-female first principle of the universe, spirit-matter, called in Greek translation Pothos or Eros. ^125:6 Compare "The Darkness comprehended it not" from the Prologue to the Fourth Gospel.Here, Philo, the translator, mentions that some refer to the prime substance of Chaos as "Slime," while others describe it as "Fermentation" in a watery medium. The primal elements and their subdivisions are discussed. The same distinction appears in the cosmogonic account in "The Shepherd," but with more detail. Presumably, the elements are still mingled together as described in "The Shepherd." This occurs after the land and water were separated. The term used is "egregoresen," the same as in the Greek translation of The Book of Enoch when discussing the Watchers (Egregores). The best source of information is the article "Megaloi Theoi" in Reseller's Detailed Lexicon of Greek and Roman Mythology, Vol. II. ii. (Leipzig, 1894-97).

VI

AN EGYPTIAN PROTOTYPE OF THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE POeMANDRES' COSMOGONY

THE HIGHER CRITICISM OF THE "POeMANDRES"

Reading through the remaining Trismegistic literature shows that it all refers back to the Poemandres teachings as the earliest form of the tradition in Greek. The current form of our "Poemandres" text is clearly not the original, but whatever the original was, it included the cosmological part. If we see this cosmogenesis as a purely literary work, higher criticism would aim to identify and trace its various elements. However, before attempting this, it's important to consider the nature of the document. It presents itself as an apocalypse or the record of an apocalyptic vision, rather than a compilation from existing literary sources.The text states that it is the work of a visionary and prophet, not a scribe or commentator. It claims to be an inspired document, a scripture, rather than the work of a scholar. There are many examples of this type of writing in other scriptures, so it's helpful to briefly consider their nature.

[p. 129]

In original apocalyptic writings, we generally do not find prior formal literary material being used—that is, previously existing written sources are not incorporated. Instead, the seer uses the forms and terms of existing ideas to express what they see. These forms and terms come from existing written and oral traditions, and the prophetic writer must use the thought-language of their time to express themselves. This does not negate the possibility of them having seen a true vision or being inspired. It is evident that whoever wrote the "Poemandres" was deeply influenced by the religious, mystical, philosophical, and scientific thought of their time, using the thought-language of their day. It is also clear that any "newness" in them came from the nature of the inspiration they received. This new inspiration allowed them to regroup and reconstruct the ideas they had learned from their studies.

REGARDING ITS COSMOGENESIS

Regarding our cosmogenesis, it has not been possible to trace the exact verbal forms of its elements to specific literary sources. However, it is possible to point to written sources with similar ideas. Additionally, a distinct prototype has been found in Egypt itself for the main features. This discovery is credited to Reitzenstein (pp. 59 ff.).The prototype can be found in an Egyptian inscription housed in the British Museum, which was first accurately read and interpreted by Dr. J. H. Breasted. Before using it, Reitzenstein had his colleague, Professor Spiegelberg, review it. When Maspero, in reviewing Breasted's work, further confirmed Reitzenstein's interpretation, Spiegelberg revised certain points in the translation based on Maspero's suggestions. The inscription, dated around the eighth century B.C., claims to reproduce an older text from the temple of Ptah at Memphis. The main content concerns the Osiris myth, but it incorporates the unique Ptah doctrine. 

Some believe Ptah was originally just the god of craftsmanship, equated with Hephaistos by Greek interpreters. However, he was more likely the Demiurge, closely associated with the Gods of Heaven and Light, and regarded as the Dispenser of all life. In this text, Ptah is closely linked with the Supreme Deity (Atum), who emanates eight deities (the Ogdoad), each representing a different aspect of Ptah. The fourth deity, "Ptah the Great," has a theological system attached to him, which, while not entirely disregarding the previous presentation, is loosely connected to it.

Before delving into this, Reitzenstein provides Professor Spiegelberg's translation of a Prayer to Ptah from the time of Ramses III (around 1233 B.C.), found in the Papyrus Harris (I. 44, 3 ff.), to clarify the context. The prayer is as follows:

A PRAISE-GIVING TO PTAH

"Hail to thee!"You are great, you are old, Tatenen, Father of the gods, 
God ancient from the beginning; 
Who made humans, 
Who created the gods, 
Who was the first creator, 
Who made everything that followed, 
Who created the heavens; he made it from his own heart; 
Who hung it up, 
As God Shu lifted himself; 
Who formed the earth with his own power, 
Who circled in the primal waters of the Great Green, 
Who created the invisible world, which brings rest to the dead bodies; 

Who let Ra come to make them happy, 
As Prince of Eternity, 
Lord of Eternity, 
Lord of Life; 
Who fills the lungs with air, 
Who gives breath to every nostril, 
Who gives life to all beings with his gifts. Length of life, fortune, and fate are under his control 
They live by what comes out of his mouth.
Who made contentment for all the gods, 
In his form of ancient primal water; 
Lord of Eternity, to whom Eternity is subject, 
Breath of Life for all beings. 

There are other similar hymns in which other gods are praised, especially Thoth and Horus. Now, let's turn to our inscription, and to that part of the text assigned to the fourth of the Forms of Manifestation, or Aspects or Persons, of Ptah. 

PTAH-THOTH THE WISE ONE

Ptah the Great is the heart and tongue of the god-circle.

(Two gods) are they, one as heart, the other as tongue, emanations of Atum. Ptah is exceedingly great; if he ... then their spirits are in this heart and tongue of his. When Horus arose in him (Atum) as Ptah, and when Thoth arose in him as Ptah, the power of heart and tongue came into being through him. It is Atum who brings forth his being out of every body and out of every mouth of all the gods. All humans, all quadrupeds, all creeping things live through his thoughts and words, whatever he wills.His divine essence is before him; he is teeth and lips, vessels and hands. Atum is part of his divine essence; Atum is in his vessels, in his hands. The divine essence also includes teeth and lips in the mouth that has spoken the name of everything, from which Shu and Tefnut emerged.

Then the divine essence organized the seeing of the eye, the hearing of the ear, the smelling of the nose, which made the heart's desires arise. And it is the heart that fulfills every desire, but it is the tongue that repeats what the heart desires.

He (Ptah) gives existence to all gods, to Atum and his divine essence, because every divine word comes into existence through the heart's desire and the tongue's command. He creates the ka; he makes all nourishment and all offerings with this word; he makes what is loved and what is hated. He gives life to the pious and death to the impious. He crafts every fabric and every creation.

The actions of the arms, the movement of the feet, the motion of all limbs are accomplished by the utterance of the word, because of the heart's desire, the word that comes from the tongue and brings everything into being. Thus arises the teaching: Atum made the gods to become Ptah Tatenen as soon as the gods came into existence. All things come from him: sacrifice and food, as well as offerings and all good things.

He is Thoth the Wise, whose power is greater than that of the other gods. Thoth united himself with Ptah after bringing forth all things and all divine words; after he had fashioned the gods, created the cities, and settled the regions. He established the gods in their shrines, ordained their sacrifices, founded their temples, and made statues for their contentment.If the gods enter their bodies, then Ptah is present in every piece of wood, every jewel, and every metal. Everything thrives under his influence if the gods are there. All gods and their spirits make offerings to him, uniting together for the Lord of the Two Lands.

With these words, the special theological system dedicated to the fourth aspect of Ptah concludes, and the text shifts back to the Osiris myth. EGYPTIAN SYNCRETISM 1000 B.C. From this fascinating inscription taken from an ancient document, we learn that in Egypt, around a thousand years before the "Poemandres," there was already a clear example of syncretism. This means an attempt to combine three different god myths or traditions into a single system. These are:

1. The Hermopolitan myth of Thoth as the Logos-Demiurge, who often appears as an aspect of the Supreme Being.
2. The doctrine of the Ptah-priests of Memphis, where Ptah as the Primal Deity creates himself, all gods and humans, and shapes the world.
3. The Heliopolitan theology, where Atum, the first of a group of nine gods, unites his eight fellow gods within himself and is the Primal God and foundation of everything.

The scribe or prophet used very early ideas, suggesting that multiple gods are just parts of one single God. Also, a specific god can resemble another more general god in certain traits. Thus, Atum is truly the Primal God, but his "Body" (or Pleroma) consists of eight different forms of Ptah. Atum has created them; therefore, he is "he who creates himself." Similarly, Ptah has created Atum and himself.The most important part of this universal Ptah-Being or Cosmic God is Ptah the Great, who represents the Heart and Tongue—Horus as the Heart and Thoth as the Tongue. Thoth manifests as the Tongue or Word to fulfill the cosmic purpose, but the Word is simply the thought that has emerged from the Person. Thoth and Horus are inseparably linked with Ptah. Reitzenstein believes that the reason for including this system in a discussion that otherwise focuses on the Osiris myth is due to the roles played by Horus and Thoth in that myth. However, this is clearly a unique system where Thoth is the One God, the Word through whom all things were made. This should be evident to any careful reader, so there's no need for further elaboration. Although we have only one example of this kind of syncretism, it was likely common in Egypt. Here, the idea of multiple gods united in one, each showing a dominant attribute separately but together possessing all attributes, was essential in a culture where many gods coexisted with the belief in one supreme being.

THE DOCTRINE OF "POeMANDRES" COMPARED WITH THAT OF ITS PROTOTYPE

Our inscription is not only generally useful but also particularly helpful in understanding the main elements of the "Poemandres" creation story. Translating the ideas of the Atum-Ptah-Thoth combination into Greek could only result in the terms theos (God), demiurge or demiurgic mind (demioyrgos or demioyrgos nous), and mind and word (nous and logos), as seen in our text.This argument is even stronger if we consider that if Thoth, after organizing the cosmos, reunited with Ptah, he must have completed the organization that came from Ptah. The writer clearly expresses that the Word is the Thought of Ptah in action, and they are inseparably united. Similarly, in the "Poemandres," the Logos returns to the Demiurgic Mind after completing the cosmic order and reunites with it. This fundamental similarity is not by chance, so we conclude that a doctrine similar to our inscription's theology is the main source of the "Poemandres" cosmogony. This establishes our cosmogony on Egyptian grounds. Adding to this, the general Egyptian belief that a person's soul, after being purified in the afterlife, returns to God to live eternally as a god with the gods, supports the idea that the main part of the "Poemandres" treatise is the Hellenized doctrine of Egyptian priests—the mystery tradition. This aligns with the belief from the Hermes Prayers that the God as Mind dwells in the pious. Similarly, Ptah in our inscription gives life to the pious and death to the impious. Early accounts show Ptah, the Mind, as the imparter of knowledge to the gods—essentially the inventor of philosophy, as Diogenes Laertius tells us: "The Egyptians declare that Hephaistos was the source of philosophy, led by priests and prophets." Ptah, the Mind, reveals himself to his followers and gives them good counsel; "Ptah hath spoken to thee," as Suidas tells us.The Greek-Egyptian saying, best explained by the Stele of Intef, informs us that people describe the heart of Intef as "an oracle of the god within everyone."

All this evidence clearly shows that the fundamental ideas of the "Poemandres" are Egyptian, discrediting the theory of Neoplatonic forgery. Even Deveria's conjectures are closer to the truth than the confident claims of many renowned scholars.

THE MAN-DOCTRINE

However, according to Reitzenstein (p. 69), what is not Egyptian is the doctrine of the Heavenly Man, the Son of God, who descends and becomes a slave to fate. This Man, though initially powerful, descends into weakness and bondage and must regain his freedom and original state. This doctrine is believed to have originated from the Chaldaean mystery traditions but was widespread in Hellenistic circles, with parallels in all major mystery traditions. We will analyze this further, especially through one of the most complex and puzzling Gnostic documents.

4. An epithet of Ptah. Compare with the Hymn to Ra by Budge (op. cit., i. 339): "Praise to thee O Ra, exalted Sekhem, Ta-thenen, Begetter of his Gods." Sekhem means vital "power"; Tathenen presumably represents Creative Life or Creative Power. Budge also mentions that Tathenen is symbolized as a fire-spitting serpent armed with a knife (p. 230).
5. The Heaven is the Great Heart of the Great Cosmos; in humans, the heart is the seat of true understanding and will.Shu generally represents the dry air between the earth and sky. In the Hymn to Amen-Ra, it says, "You are the One God, who formed yourself into two gods; you are the creator of the egg, and you produced your Twin-gods" (Budge, op. cit., ii. 89). Shu's twin or counterpart is Tefnut, who represents the moist air in earthly terms; but Shu is also associated with Light. The Ocean of Heaven refers to the sky. The life or breath of the Creator is mentioned. The water of the Great Green refers to the sea. Paut refers to a group or hierarchy, specifically an Ogdoad here. Thoth and Horus are named. The heart (Horus) controls action by means of fingers and toes through ducts or vessels (arteries, veins, and nerves), representing their hidden significance; while the tongue (Thoth) in the mouth, supported by teeth and lips, is the organ of speech and intelligent expression. The term likely means "commands" or "gives expression to." It brings things into being, acting as the Demiurge. The term should perhaps mean "word of the language of the gods"—the language expressed through actions in the world. It refers to the results of actions that gods and humans rely on for sustenance. Ptah, as the Demiurgic Power, is implied. Hieroglyphics were symbols of words of action, representing expressions of being in action. The term "copper" is used literally. The worlds of gods (immortals) and men (mortals) are mentioned. Reitzenstein suggests that Ptah, the God of Memphis, is the divinity of all Egypt, implying both the physical upper and lower lands, but I prefer a broader interpretation.This doesn't mean, I believe, that there was no "reincarnation." That is, the essence of a person did not create other "souls," but the "soul" of a specific life did not return. Instead, all that was worthy of immortality became a god among the gods, or "those who truly exist."

VII

THE MYTH OF MAN IN THE MYSTERIES

THE GNOSTIC TRADITION

"BUT All-Father Mind, being Life and Light, brought forth Man (Anthropos) equal to Himself."

This is the opening paragraph of the soteriological part of the "Poemandres" treatise from our Trismegistic literature. This Man or Anthropos is the Spiritual Prototype of humanity and every individual person, a technical term found in several early Christian Gnostic systems. For example, in a system outlined in the polemical Refutation of Irenaeus, which the Bishop of Lyons associates with an Ophite tradition, while Theodoret attributes it to the Sethians, we learn that in the Unutterable Depth were two Great Lights: the First Man, or Father, and His Son, the Second Man; and also the Holy Spirit, the First Woman, or Mother of all living. In this tradition, the Son of the Mother, the chief Formative Power of the seven Demiurgic Potencies of the sensible cosmos, is called Ialdabaoth (possibly meaning the Child of the Egg), who boasts himself to be supreme. But his mother, Wisdom, reproves his pride, saying to him: "Do not lie, Ialdabaoth, for above you is the Father of All, the First Man, and Man Son of Man."

THE "PHILOSOPHUMENA" OF HIPPOLYTUS

The main source of our information on this Anthropos tradition in its Christianized Gnostic form is found in Hippolytus' Philosophumena, or Refutation of all Heresies.In 1842, Minoides Mynas, a learned Greek sent on a literary mission by the French Government, discovered the only manuscript we have of this very valuable work in a monastery on Mount Athos. The manuscript, generally dated to the 14th century, originally had ten books, but unfortunately, the first three and part of the fourth are missing. However, the first book was already known, though it was mistakenly attributed to Origen, and was included in the main edition of the work by Emmanuel Miller (Oxford, 1851). The missing Books II and III discussed the doctrines and mysteries of the Egyptians and the Chaldeans, respectively. Hippolytus claimed that he revealed all their mysteries, as well as the secrets of certain Christian mystics whom he labeled as heretics in Books V-IX.

Interestingly, the exact books where these revelations were made are the ones missing. Not only have they disappeared, but the summary of their contents is also omitted in the Epitome at the beginning of Book X. This suggests that this information, which would be invaluable for understanding the history of religious ideas and the background of early Christianity, might have been deliberately removed. Why were these books taken out? Were later Christian Orthodox individuals deterred by religious concerns, or were they afraid to share this information? Hippolytus himself seemed to have no such reservations; he often boasted about sharing the most sacred secrets with the public, making it his mission to proclaim what had been whispered in secret.He took great pleasure in triumphing over "error" by boasting, "I have your secret documents, and I am going to publish them!" So why should those who followed him hesitate? They were surely similar to Hippolytus and would have been just as eager to bring down the pride of the hated Mystery-institutions. Could it be that they understood much better than he did that different conclusions could be drawn from his "startling revelations"?

THE NAASSENES

An early tradition of Jewish and Christian mystics, whom Hippolytus calls Naassenes, believed that different conclusions could indeed be drawn from the Mystery-rites and Mystery-myths. These Gnostics claimed that Christianity, or the Good News of Christ, was actually the fulfillment of the inner teachings of the Mystery-institutions of all nations; their ultimate goal was the revelation of the Mystery of Man.

It’s important to note that the Naassenes, who referred to themselves as Gnostics, are the first group of Christian "heretics" Hippolytus addresses. He places them at the beginning of his Refutation, suggesting they were either the oldest or represented the most ancient form of Christian "heresy." Although the name Naassene comes from the Hebrew word for Serpent (Nahash), Hippolytus does not call them Ophites. He reserves the term Ophites for another group he also calls Cainites and Nochaitae, which he does not consider significant enough to discuss further.The Naassenes had many secret books, called apocrypha, which were not widely circulated. They also considered the following scriptures as authoritative: The Gospel of Perfection, The Gospel of Eve, The Questions of Mary, Concerning the Offspring of Mary, The Gospel of Philip, The Gospel according to Thomas, and The Gospel according to the Egyptians. These texts suggest an Alexandrian or Egyptian origin.

ANALYSIS OF HIPPOLYTUS' ACCOUNT OF THE NAASSENE DOCUMENT

One of their secret manuscripts came into the possession of Hippolytus, the Bishop of Portus. Reitzenstein (pp. 81 ff.) examines this document, proposing the existence of a "Hellenistic Myth of the God Anthropos." He argues that by removing the Christian elements from the Naassene writer's work, we are left with a purely pagan document. According to Reitzenstein, Hippolytus' account of their views can be divided into three parts:

1. The first part explains the name "Naassene" and concludes with a statement that their tradition came from James, the Brother of the Lord, who passed it to Mariamne.
2. The third part also provides an explanation of the name and includes fragments of hymns from a liturgical collection.
3. Between these two parts lies a more detailed exposition where Hippolytus attempts to show that Naassene doctrines were derived from the Mysteries. He asserts that the Naassenes were essentially followers of the Mysteries of the Mother of the Gods, supporting this claim by quoting extensively from a secret document of their school.Our interest in these quotations differs significantly from Hippolytus's interest. As Reitzenstein has shown, the Christian quotations and ideas in this document clearly disrupt its original flow and can mostly be removed without affecting the overall sense. However, disentangling the Old Testament quotations from the Hellenistic source, and even more so from the New Testament quotations, is not as straightforward. The nature of these quotations suggests that there was a Jewish revision of the text before the Christians edited it. Reitzenstein does not go this far. 

Even if we only consider Reitzenstein's analysis, it is clear that the Old Testament quotations were not part of the original text. This implies that we are dealing with a text that was originally Pagan, later edited by a Gnostic Christian. The original Pagan text had been altered by the Naassene editor before it reached Hippolytus. Since the Christianized text must have circulated privately for some time before reaching the Bishop of Portus's library—and considering that Hippolytus believed he was looking at a foundational document of early Christian "heretics"—it is evident that dating the original Hellenistic source to the first century would not contradict the traditional view that Gnosticism first appeared during Trajan's reign (96-117 A.D.). We will revisit the question of the text's date later.Given the importance of both our treatises and the history of Gnosticism, I will provide a translation of Hippolytus' introductory, intermediate, and concluding sections. This will allow the reader to see the entire work as it comes from the heresy-hunting bishop. I will also go further in analyzing Hippolytus' material than Reitzenstein did, aiming to show the reader the natural separation of various elements. These findings are crucial for the history of Gnosticism and the development of Christian doctrines, and they warrant more than a brief chapter in our essay.

In the following analysis, H. stands for Hippolytus, C. for the Christian Gnostic final editor (the "Naassene" whose manuscript Hippolytus used), J. for the Naassene Jewish mystic who came before C. and modified the original, and S. for the original Heathen Hellenistic Source. Since H. and C. are less important for our immediate inquiry, I will print them in smaller type. J. will be in the same type as S. because J. is closer to S. and sometimes harder to separate from S. than from C.

To understand the text of Hippolytus, the reader should ignore all critical indications and read straight through.With these brief preliminary remarks, we will now present the reader with a translation of the first section, or introductory part, of Hippolytus' critique of the Naassene doctrines. Please remember that this is a depiction by one of their harshest critics.

HIPPOLYTUS' INTRODUCTION

The priests and leaders of this doctrine were initially called Naasseni, named after the Hebrew word "naas," meaning serpent. Later, they referred to themselves as Gnostics, claiming they alone understood the Depths. Many split from this group, turning the original school into numerous sects, expressing similar ideas in different doctrinal forms, as our argument will show. The Naassenes honor Man, and the Son of Man, as the Logos (Reason) of all universals. This Man is both male and female, and they call him Adamas. They have many complex hymns in his honor, which can be summarized as follows:

"From Thee, Father, and Through Thee, Mother—the two Immortal Names, Parents of Aeons, O Thou who hast the Heaven for Thy City, O Man of Mighty Names."

They divide him into three aspects, like Geryones; they say he has a mental, psychic, and material aspect. They believe that knowledge of this Man is the beginning of understanding God, saying:

"The beginning of Perfection is the knowledge of Man, but the knowledge of God is perfected Perfection."

Hippolytus says that these three aspects—mental, psychic, and earthy—came together in one man, Jesus, born of Mary. Each of these three aspects spoke from their own essence to their respective followers.There are three types of universal principles: angelic, psychic, and earthly; and three corresponding churches: angelic, psychic, and earthly, named the Elect, Called, and Bound. These are the main categories among many doctrines, which James, the Brother of the Lord, reportedly passed on to Mariamne.

To dispel the false accounts about Mariamne, James, and the Savior, let's examine the Initiations that these heretics use to create their myths. These include both non-Grecian and Grecian Initiations. By blending the secret Mysteries of various Gentiles and fabricating stories about Christ, they deceive those unaware that these are actually Gentile Orgies. Their system's foundation is Man Adamas, about whom it is written, "Who shall declare his generation?" They have taken the mysterious and contradictory nature of Man's origin and falsely applied it to Christ.

The Greeks say Earth first brought forth Man as a noble gift, desiring to create a life that is God-loving rather than just plants or animals. It is difficult to determine whether the first man, Alalkomeneus, arose among the Boeotians from the Kephisian Lake, or if it was the Idaean Kuretes, the Phrygian Korybantes, or others who were seen sprouting like trees by Helios. It could also be that Arkadia produced Pelasgos, older than the Moon; Eleusis Diaulos, who lived in Raria; Lemnos Kabeiros, a child of sacred orgies; or Pallene Phlegraean Alkyoneus, the eldest of the Giants.The Libyans say that Garamas, emerging from dry lands, was the first to pick sweet dates. Meanwhile, the Nile River in Egypt continues to nourish the land, creating fertile soil that produces life. 

The Assyrians believe that Oannes, the Fish-eater, was responsible, while the Chaldaeans claim it was Adam. This Adam, they say, was a man created by Earth—just a body without breath or movement, like a statue, representing the Man Above.

The Chaldaeans sing of this Man Above, brought into existence by many Powers, about which they have extensive teachings. They say that in order for the Great Man from Above to be fully humbled, he was given a Soul. This Soul causes the Great, Beautiful, and Perfect Man to endure suffering and discipline.

They seek to understand what the Soul is, where it comes from, and its nature, not through Scriptures but through Mysteries. They say that the Soul is very difficult to understand because it constantly changes appearance, form, and state, making it hard to describe or define.

These various transformations are recorded in a Gospel titled "According to the Egyptians." Therefore, they are uncertain—like all other Gentiles—whether the Soul comes from the Pre-existing One, the Self-begotten, or the Streaming Chaos.H: To start, when we examine the threefold nature of humans, we refer to the teachings of the Assyrians. They were the first to consider the soul as both threefold and unified. 

S: Every being, he says, seeks the soul in some manner, because the soul is the cause of all life. Anything that lives and grows needs a soul. Without a soul, there can be no sustenance or growth. Even stones, he claims, have souls, as they have the ability to grow. Growth is a form of sustenance, achieved through addition, which nourishes what sustains. 

The Assyrians call this mystery "Adonis" or "Endymion." When it is referred to as Adonis, it means that Aphrodite (representing creation) is in love with and desires the soul. According to their beliefs, Aphrodite embodies the process of creation.

However, when Persephone (or Kore) loves Adonis, the soul becomes subject to death and separates from Aphrodite, which means it departs from the realm of creation. If Selene falls for Endymion and loves beauty, it represents the higher nature desiring the soul.

If the Mother of the Gods emasculates Attis, viewing him as her beloved, it signifies the higher, eternal nature calling back the masculine power of the soul to herself.

According to their theory, humans are both male and female. Thus, sexual intercourse between man and woman is seen as harmful and is forbidden in their teachings.For Attis, he says, is emasculated—that is, the soul is separated from the earthly parts of creation that tend downwards and ascends in search of the eternal essence above—

where, he says, there is "neither male nor female," but a new creature, a new being who is both male and female. What they call "Above" will be explained later. They claim this theory is supported not only by the myth of Rhea but also by universal creation. They even argue that this is what was conveyed by the Word (Logos):

"For the invisible attributes of God—namely, His eternal power and divine nature—are clearly seen from the creation of the world, being understood through what has been made, so that people are without excuse. Even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but their foolish hearts were darkened.

"Claiming to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for images resembling corruptible man, birds, animals, and reptiles.

"Therefore, God gave them up to dishonorable passions. Their females exchanged natural relations for those that are against nature—

And what they consider natural will be discussed later. 

—"and likewise, the males abandoned natural relations with females and were consumed with passion for one another, males committing shameful acts with males—

And "shameful acts," according to them, pertain to the First and Blessed Formless Essence, the source of all forms for created things.

—and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error." They say that Paul's words encompass their entire hidden and ineffable mystery of blessed bliss.The promise of the baptism ritual, according to them, is nothing less than the introduction into eternal happiness for those who are washed with Living Water and anointed with a special Chrism.

They claim that not only the Mysteries of the Assyrians and Phrygians support this teaching about the Blessed Nature, which is both hidden and revealed, but also those of the Egyptians. This Nature, they say, is the Kingdom of Heaven sought within man, a teaching passed down in the Gospel of Thomas:

"He who seeks shall find me in children from the age of seven; for at fourteen, I am revealed." However, this saying is actually attributed to Hippocrates: "A boy of seven is half a father."

They believe that the Original Nature of the universe is found in the Original Seed, interpreting Hippocrates' saying to mean that at fourteen, this nature is fully revealed. This is their profound and mysterious teaching.

They also mention that the Egyptians, who are considered the most ancient people after the Phrygians and the first to share the Mystery-rites and rituals of the gods, have sacred and secret mysteries of Isis. These mysteries involve the search for Osiris' missing part by the seven-robed, black-clad Goddess. According to them, Osiris represents Water.And Seven-robed Nature—

H.—wearing seven ethereal robes, representing the planets, as they are symbolically called—

S.—transformed by the Ineffable, the Unchangeable, the Unseen, and the Formless, is shown as creation. J. This is what the Scripture says:

"Seven times the Just shall fall and rise again."

These "fallings" are the changes of the stars, set in motion by the Mover of all things. S. They declare that the Essence of the Seed, which causes all things in Genesis, is beyond these things, but it creates all things, saying:

"I become what I will, and am what I am."

Therefore, That which moves all remains unmoved; it stays what it is, creating everything, and does not become any of the things produced. This is the Only Good—

C. And this is what the Saviour said:

"Why do you call me Good? Only One is Good—my Father in the Heavens, who makes His sun rise on the righteous and unrighteous, and sends rain on saints and sinners."

H. And who are the saints and sinners on whom He sends rain—this is also explained later. S. This is the Great, Hidden, and Unknown Mystery of the Egyptians, Hidden yet Revealed. For there is no temple before whose entrance the Hidden Mystery does not stand naked, pointing from below to above, crowned with all its fruits of creation.The text was adapted into modern English while maintaining the original meaning:

(10) They say it is symbolized not only in the most sacred temples before the statues but also displayed for public knowledge—

—as if it were "a light not under a bushel, but on a candlestick"—a message "proclaimed from the rooftops."

—on all the roads, in all the streets, and even by the houses as a boundary and limit of the dwelling. This is the God spoken of by everyone, although they call Him Bringer-of-good without understanding what they mean. The Greeks got this mystery-symbol from the Egyptians and still have it today. We see the "Hermes" honored by them in this form. (11) The Cyllenians, treating this symbol with special honor, regard it as the Logos.

For Hermes is the Logos, who, as the Interpreter and Creator of all things past, present, and future, was honored by them with this figure, specifically an ithyphallus. Hermes, symbolized in this way, is the Conductor and Guide of souls and the Cause of souls, as noted by the poets when they say:

"But Cyllenian Hermes summoned forth the souls
Of men mindful"—

—not the "suitors" of Penelope, unfortunate souls, but those awakened from sleep and with their memories restored—

"From what honor and how great a degree of blessedness."

That is, from the Blessed Man Above—

—or Original Man, or Adamas, as they believe—

—they were brought down into the plasm of clay to be enslaved to the Demiurge of this creation, Esaldaios—

—a fiery God, fourth in number, for thus they call the Demiurge and Father of this specific cosmos.(13) S. "And he holds a rod in his hands, beautiful and golden; with it, he can enchant people, putting them to sleep or waking them as he wishes."

This, H. says, is He who alone has the power over life and death.

J. About Him, it is written: "You shall shepherd them with a rod of iron."

But the poet, H. says, wanted to highlight the mysterious and blessed nature of the Logos, so he gave Him a golden rod instead of an iron one. S. "He enchants the eyes" of the dead, H. says, and "wakes them from sleep," making them aware.

C. The Scripture says about them: "Awake, you who sleep, and rise, and Christ will give you light."

This is the Christ, the Son of Man, H. says, present in all born from the Logos, who cannot be fully described. S. This, H. says, is the Great Ineffable Mystery of the Eleusinia: "Hye Kye."

J. And H. says that all things are under His authority, as it is said: "Their sound has gone out into all the earth."

(14) S. And "Hermes leads them, moving his rod, and they follow, squeaking"—the souls in a group, as the poet depicts with this image:

"But like bats in some dark cave,
If one falls from the group,
They cling together and squeak."

J. The "rock," H. says, represents Adamas. This, H. says, is the "cornerstone"—

C. —"that has become the head of the corner." In the "Head" is the Brain of the Essence, from which "every fatherhood" gets its expression—

J. —which "I lay in Zion, a foundation."

H. says this refers, allegorically, to the formation of man.The inner man, or Adamas, is the foundation of Zion, represented as the "teeth" or the "fence of the teeth," like Homer says. This is the Wall and Palisade where the inner man resides, having fallen from the Primal Man, the Adamas Above. The "Stone cut without hands" cuts it and brings it down into the physical world, a state of forgetfulness, made of earthly clay.

The souls followed Him, the Logos, squeaking as they went. Hermes led them down the dark paths, guiding them into eternal lands free from deceit. They passed by the streams of Ocean, the White Rock, the Gates of the Sun, and the People of Dreams.

Ocean represents the source of birth for gods and men, flowing and ebbing forever. When Ocean flows down, it causes the birth of men; when it flows up, towards the Wall, Palisade, and the White Rock, it causes the birth of gods. This is reflected in the saying,

"I have said you are Gods and all Sons of the Highest, if you flee from Egypt and cross the Red Sea into the Desert"; meaning, move from the lower realm to the higher Jerusalem, the Mother of the Living. "But if you return to Egypt," meaning the lower realm, "you shall die like men."

All generation in the lower realm is subject to death, but the birth from above is above death. The spiritual man is born from water, or spirit, not from flesh; the lower man is fleshly. This aligns with the saying, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is spirit."

This is their spiritual birth.This, he says, is the Great Jordan, which, flowing downwards, prevented the Israelites from leaving Egypt and interacting with the world below. According to them, Egypt represents the body. Jesus turned the Jordan back, making it flow upwards. Following these and similar ideas, these so-called "Gnostics," who think they have discovered a new grammatical art, believe that the prophet Homer hinted at these things in a hidden way. They introduce these notions to those unfamiliar with the Sacred Scriptures and mock them. They argue that anyone who says everything comes from One is wrong; instead, they say things come from Three, and they claim to provide proof of the basic principles of things.

One, he says, is the Blessed Nature of the Blessed Man Above, Adamas; another is the Nature Below, which is subject to Death; and the third is the Race born Above without a king, where Mariam the sought-for, Jothor the great sage, Sepphora the seer, and Moses, whose birth was not in Egypt, belong. Sons were born to Moses in Midian.

This, he says, was also noted by the poets: "All things were divided into three, and each received his share of honor."

The Greatnesses, he says, must be spoken of, but in such a way that everyone hears without understanding and sees without perceiving. For unless, he says, the Greatnesses were spoken, the cosmos would not hold together. These are the Three Mighty Words: Kaulakau, Saulasau, Zeesar;—Kaulakau represents the Logos Above, Adamas; Saulasau represents the Logos Below; Zeesar represents the Jordan flowing upwards.He is the male-female Man in everyone, whom the ignorant call the three-bodied Geryones—"Earth-flow-er," as if flowing from the earth. The Greeks often call Him the "Heavenly Horn of Men" because He has mixed and mingled all things together. "All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. In Him is Life."

This Life is the ineffable Race of perfect humans, unknown to former generations. The "nothing" made without Him refers to the special cosmos, created without Him by the third and fourth rulers.

This is the drinking vessel—the Cup in which "the King drinks and divines." It was found hidden in the "fair seed" of Benjamin. The Greeks, speaking with inspired tongue, say:

"Bring water, bring me wine, boy! Give me to drink, and let me sleep! My Cup tells me of what race I must be born, Speaking with silent words."

This would be enough if men could understand—the Cup of Anacreon speaking the Ineffable Mystery without words. Anacreon's Cup is silent, as it tells him with unspoken sound of what Race he must be born—spiritual, not carnal—if he hears the Hidden Mystery in Silence. This is the Water at the Fair Nuptials which Jesus turned into Wine. "This is the great and true beginning of the signs which Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee, revealing His Kingdom of Heaven."

This is the Kingdom of Heaven within us, stored up as a Treasure, like "Leaven hidden in three measures of Flour."This is what he calls the Great Ineffable Mystery of the Samothracians:

It is lawful for the perfect alone to know, meaning for us. The Samothracians, in their Mysteries, explicitly teach that this Adam is the Original Man. In the initiation temple of the Samothracians, there are two statues of naked men with raised hands to heaven, similar to the statue of Hermes in Cyllene.

These statues are images of the Original Man and the regenerated spiritual man, who is of the same substance as the Original Man. This is what the Saviour said:

"If you do not drink My Blood and eat My Flesh, you shall not enter the Kingdom of Heaven.

"But even if you drink the Cup which I drink, you cannot come where I go."

He knew the nature of each of His disciples and that each must go to his own nature. He chose twelve disciples from the twelve tribes and spoke to each tribe through them.

For this reason, not everyone has heard the teachings of the twelve disciples; and even if they hear, they cannot accept them because the teachings are not according to their nature.

The Thracians who live around Haimos call this Man Korybas, and the Phrygians do the same. They say He descends from the Head Above and the expressive Brain, passing through all sources of things below. How and in what manner He descends, we do not understand. This is what was spoken:

"His Voice we heard, but His Form we have not seen."For (H. he says), the Voice of Him, when He has been sent and expressed, is heard, but the Form that descended from Above, from the Inexpressible [Man]—what it is, no one knows. It is in the earthly form, but no one has knowledge of it. This [Man] (H. he says) is He who "inhabits the Flood," according to the Psalter, who cries and calls from "many waters."

The "many waters" (H. he says) are the various generations of men subject to death, from which He shouts and calls to the Inexpressible Man, saying:

"Save my [? Thy] only-begotten from the lions."

To this [Man] (H. he says) it has been spoken:

"You are my Son, O Israel, fear not; should you pass through rivers, they shall not engulf you; should you pass through fire, it shall not consume you."

By "rivers" (H. he says) he means the Moist Essence of Genesis, and by "fire" the impulse and desire towards Genesis. And: "You are mine; fear not."

And again he says:

"If a mother forgets her children so as not to take pity on them or feed them, [then] I too will forget you"—says Adamas (H. he says) to his own men. "No, even if a woman forgets them, I will not forget you. Upon my hands have I engraved you."

And concerning His Ascent—

C. —that is, his regeneration in order that he may be born spiritual, not fleshly. J. —the Scripture says (H. he says):

"Lift up the gates, you who are rulers of you, and be lifted up, you everlasting gates, and the King of Glory shall come in."

This is a wonder of wonders. "For who (H. he says) is this King of Glory? A worm and no man, the scorn of men, and the contempt of the people. He is the King of Glory, the Mighty in War."

By "War" he means the "war in the body," for the form is made of conflicting elements, as it is written (H. he says):

"Remember the war that is waged in the body."This (H. he says) is the entrance and the gate that Jacob saw when he traveled to Mesopotamia. 

C. This represents the transition from childhood to puberty and manhood; it was revealed to him as he journeyed to Mesopotamia. J. Mesopotamia, according to H., is the great ocean stream flowing from the middle of the Perfect Man. Jacob was amazed by the Heavenly Gate and said:

"How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God; indeed, this is the gate of heaven."

C. Because of this, H. says, Jesus said:

"I am the true door."

J. And the one who says these things, according to H., is the one from the Inexpressible Man, expressed from above--

C. --as the perfect man. Therefore, the imperfect man cannot be saved unless he is reborn by passing through this gate. S. This same Man, H. says, the Phrygians also call Papa; for He calmed everything that was in disorder and chaos before His manifestation. The name Papa, H. says, is the sound of all things together in heaven, on earth, and beneath the earth, saying: "Calm, calm" the discord of the universe. C. And: Make "peace for those who are far"—that is, the material and earthly—and "peace for those who are near"—that is, the spiritual, knowledgeable, and perfect men. S. The Phrygians also call Him dead when buried in the body as though in a tomb or sepulchre. C. This, H. says, is what is meant by:

"You are whitewashed tombs, filled within with bones of the dead, for Man, the Living One, is not in you." And again, He says:

"The dead shall leap forth from their graves"—

—that is, from their earthly bodies, regenerated spiritually, not physically. This, H. says, is the resurrection that occurs through the gate of heaven, through which all those who do not pass, H. says, remain dead.The Phrygians call this transformed man a God. 

For he becomes a God when he rises from the dead and passes into Heaven through a gate. This is the gate that Paul the Apostle mentioned, saying he was taken up by an angel to the second or even the third heaven, into Paradise, where he saw and heard unspeakable things that humans are not allowed to utter.

These are the mysteries, ineffable yet spoken of by all, which we also speak of, but not with words taught by human wisdom, but by the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things. However, the natural man does not accept the things of God’s Spirit, for they seem foolish to him.

These are the ineffable mysteries of the Spirit that we alone know. The Savior said about these mysteries: 

"No one can come to Me unless my Heavenly Father draws him."

It is very difficult to receive and accept this great ineffable mystery. The Savior also said:

"Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the Kingdom of Heaven, but only those who do the will of My Father in Heaven."

They must do the will, not just hear it, to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.

He also said:

"The tax collectors and prostitutes will enter the Kingdom of Heaven before you."

By "tax collectors" He meant those who understand and receive the ultimate principles of the universe. We are the "tax collectors" upon whom the consummation of the ages has come.For the "consummations" (H. he says) are the Seeds spread throughout the cosmos from the Inexpressible [Man], through which the whole cosmos is completed; for through these Seeds, it also began to exist. And this (H. he says) is what is meant:

"The Sower went out to sow. Some Seeds fell by the wayside and were trampled underfoot; others fell on rocky places, and although they sprouted, they withered and died because they had no depth. Others (H. he says) fell on good and fertile ground and produced fruit—some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!" 

This means (H. he says) that no one has understood these Mysteries except the gnostic, perfect [man]. This (H. he says) is the "good and fertile ground" that Moses spoke of when he said:

"I will bring you into a good and fertile land, a land flowing with milk and honey."

This (H. he says) is the "honey and milk" by tasting which the perfect [men] become free from all rule and share in the Fullness. This (H. he says) is the Fullness through which all things that are created both exist and are fulfilled from the Ungenerated [Man].

This same [Man] is called "Unfruitful" by the Phrygians because He is unfruitful as long as He is fleshly and works the deeds of the flesh. This (H. he says) is what is meant by:

"Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire."

These "fruits" (H. he says) are the logical, living men who pass through the third Gate.

At any rate, they say:

"If you have eaten dead things and made living ones, what will you make if you eat living things?"

By "living things" they mean logical concepts, minds, and men—the "pearls" of that Inexpressible [Man] cast into the physical world.

This is what He says (H. he says):

"Do not give what is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine."H. They say that the work of swine symbolizes the sexual relations between a man and a woman. S. This same man, they say, is called Ai-polos by the Phrygians—not because he herds goats as some interpret, but because he is "Always-turning" (Aei-polon), revolving and directing the cosmos in its rotation. The term "polein" means to turn and change things. Hence, the two centers of heaven are called poles. The poet also refers to this concept when he says: "Hither there comes and there goes (poleitai) Old Man of the Sea, whose words are always true—Egypt's undying Proteus."

[p. 177]

By "poleitai," he means "he turns about" or "comes and goes." Similarly, the cities where we live, because we move around and circulate in them, are called "poleis." Thus, the Phrygians refer to this man who turns and changes all things at all times as Ai-polos. The Phrygians also call him Fruitful. J. For they say: "Many more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband."

C. This means the regenerated, immortal, and ever-continuing children are many, though few are born this way, while the fleshly children, though many, all perish.

[p. 178]

C. For this reason, they say: "Rachel wept for her children and would not be comforted because she knew they were gone."

J. Jeremiah also laments the earthly Jerusalem—not the city in Phoenicia, but the generation below subject to destruction. C. For Jeremiah also knew the perfect man, regenerated from water and spirit, not fleshly. J. As Jeremiah said: "He is man, and who shall know him?"C. Thus, the knowledge of the perfect man is profound and difficult to understand. J. For "The beginning of Perfection," he says, "is the knowledge of man, but the knowledge of God is complete Perfection."

(26) S. The Phrygians, he says, also call Him "Plucked Green Wheat-ear." Similarly, the Athenians use this term during the secret rites at Eleusis, where they show those who silently receive the final initiation a plucked wheat-ear.

And this Wheat-ear is also known among the Athenians as the Light-giver--

C. --perfect and mighty--

J. --from the Inexpressible--

S. --as the hierophant himself. Unlike "Attis," who is emasculated, the hierophant is made a eunuch with hemlock juice--

C. --and separated from all physical generation--

S. --at night, at Eleusis, celebrating the Great Ineffable Mysteries. When the bright light appears, he shouts and cries aloud:

"[Our] Lady has brought forth a Holy Son: Brimo has given birth to Brimos"--

--which means, the Strong to the Strong. (27) J. "[Our] Lady," he says, is the Heavenly Genesis, and the Strong is the one who is thus generated. This Mystery is called "Eleusis" and "Anaktoreion"; "Eleusis," because we--

C. --the spiritual--

J. --come from Above, streaming down from Adamas, as "eleus-esthai" means "to come"; and "Anaktoreion" from "anag-esthai," meaning "leading back," or "returning" Above.

This Return, he says, is what those initiated into the great Mysteries of Eleusinia speak of. (28) S. The law states that after being initiated into the Little Mysteries, one should be further initiated into the Great. "For greater deaths lead to greater fates."The Little Mysteries, he says, are about Persephone Below. These Mysteries and the path to them are described by the poet as:

"Beneath this is another path, cold as death,
Hollow and clayey. But this one is best to lead
To the delightful grove of far-honored Aphrodite."

These, he says, are the Little Mysteries of physical generation. After being initiated into them, people should pause for a while and then be initiated into the Great heavenly Mysteries. Those who undergo the "deaths" in these Mysteries receive greater blessings. This Mystery, he says, is the Gate of Heaven and the House of God, where the Good God dwells alone. No impure person can enter, only the spiritual. When they come, they must cast away their old selves and become bridegrooms, achieving their true manhood through the Virginal Spirit.

This Virgin, he says, is pregnant, conceiving and bearing a Son, not psychic or fleshly, but a blessed Aeon of Aeons. Concerning these Mysteries, the Savior explicitly said:

"Narrow and strait is the Way that leads to Life, and few are they who find it; but broad and wide is the Way that leads to Destruction, and many are they who travel it."

Moreover, the Phrygians say that the Father of all is Amygdalos.Convert the following text into modern English; correct and simplify the text without altering its original meaning:

---

Not an ordinary tree, but the Pre-existing Amygdalos, who within Himself holds the Perfect Fruit, throbbing and moving in His Depth, tore open His Womb and gave birth to His own Son—

the Invisible, Unnameable, and Ineffable One of whom we speak.

For "amyxai" means "to break" and "cut open"; just like when physicians lance inflamed bodies or those with tumors, they call it "amychas."

Thus, the Phrygians call him Amygdalos. From whom the Invisible was born—

"Through whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made."

The Phrygians also say that what is generated from Him is Syriktes.

For what is generated is the Spirit in harmony.

For "God is Spirit."

Therefore, He says:

"True worshippers do not worship on this mountain or in Jerusalem, but in Spirit."

For the worship of perfect men is spiritual, not physical. And "Spirit" exists where both Father and Son are named, generated from Him and the Father. He is the Many-named, Myriad-eyed, Incomprehensible One, whom every nature desires in its own way. This is the Word of God, which is:

"The Word of Announcement of the Great Power. Therefore, It shall be sealed, hidden, and stored in the Habitation where the Root of all things has its foundation—

of Aeons, Powers, Intelligences, Gods, Angels, Spirits, Existing Non-existences, Generated Ingenerables, Comprehensible Incomprehensibles,--Years, Months, Days, Hours--of the Boundless Point, from which the smallest begins to grow by parts.""For," he says, "the Point, which is nothing and composed of nothing, though without parts, will become through its own Thought a Greatness beyond our understanding." This Point, he says, is the Kingdom of the Heavens, the "grain of mustard seed," the partless point, the first existing for the body; which only the spiritual people know. This, he says, is what is meant by:

"They are neither words nor languages whereby their sounds are heard."

These things, he says, which are said and done by all people, are interpreted according to their unique theory, claiming that they all have a spiritual meaning. For this reason, they also say that the performers in the theatres neither say nor do anything without Design.

For example, he says, when people gather in theatres and a man comes on stage, dressed in a unique robe with a lute in hand, chanting the Great Mysteries without understanding what he says:

"Whether blessed Child of Kronos,
or of Zeus, or of Great Rhea,--
Hail, Attis, mournful song of Rhea!

Assyrians call you thrice-longed-for Adonis;
all Egypt calls you Osiris;
the Wisdom of Greece names you Men's Heavenly Horn;
the Samothracians call you august Adama;
the Haemonians, Korybas;
the Phrygians name you Papa sometimes,
at times Dead, or God, or Unfruitful,
or Aipolos, or Green Reaped Wheat-ear,
or the Fruitful that Amygdalos brought forth,
Man, Piper . . . Attis!" 

He says that this is the Attis of many forms about whom they sing as follows:

"Of Attis will I sing, of Rhea's Beloved;--
not with the booming of bells,
nor with the deep-toned pipe of Idaean Kuretes;
but I will blend my song with Phoebus' music of the lyre. Evoi!"Evan!—for you are Pan, you are Bacchus, and Shepherd of bright stars!" HIPPOLYTUS' CONCLUSION

H. For these and similar reasons, these Naassenes attend the Mysteries of the Great Mother, believing they gain the clearest understanding of the Universal Mystery from the rituals performed there. They have no other practices beyond these mysteries, except that they are not physically castrated. Their main "achievement" is the role of the Eunuch, as they strictly enforce abstinence from sexual intercourse with women, as if they were castrated. The rest of their practices, as we have detailed, are carried out just like those of the Eunuchs.

And they honor nothing else but "Naas," which is why they are called Naasseni. Naas is the Serpent—

J. —from whom, they say, come all things called naous under heaven, from Naas. Every shrine, every initiation rite, and every mystery is dedicated to Naas alone; in general, no initiation can be found under heaven without a naos and the Naas within it, which gives it the name naos. Moreover, they say that the Serpent is the Moist Essence—

H. —just as Thales of Miletus also said—

J. —and that nothing, whether immortal or mortal, animate or inanimate, can exist without Him. They say that all things are subject to Him, and that He is Good, containing all things within Him as in "the horn of the one-horned bull"; so that He bestows beauty and bloom to all that exist according to each one's nature, as if permeating all things, just like the River flowing out of Eden and dividing into four sources.

H. They say that Eden is His Brain, bound and constricted in its surrounding layers like the heavens; while Paradise, they believe, is the Man up to His Head only.This river, coming out of Eden (i.e., from His mind), splits into four streams.

The first river is called Pheison. "It encircles the entire land of Evilat, where there is gold, and the gold of that land is good; there are also rubies and green stones."

This (he says) represents His eye—its dignity and colors testify to this. The second river is Geon. "It encircles all the land of Ethiopia."

This (he says) represents His hearing; it is complex like a labyrinth. The third river is Tigris. "It flows opposite to the Assyrians."

This (he says) represents His sense of smell, as its current is very rapid; it "flows opposite to the Assyrians" because, after exhaling, the inhaled breath comes in more quickly and forcefully. This (he says) is the nature of respiration. The fourth river is Euphrates.

This (they say) represents the mouth, through which prayer is spoken, and food enters, nourishing and expressing the spiritual, perfect man.

This river (he says) is the water above the sky.

Concerning this (he says) the Savior has said:

"If you had known who was asking, you would have asked Him in return, and He would have given you living water."

To this water (he says) every nature comes, each selecting its own essence, and from this water, each nature receives what is proper to it, more surely than iron to a magnet, gold to the bone of a sea-hawk, or chaff to amber.If any man is "blind from birth" and has not seen "the True Light, which enlightens everyone who comes into the world," let him see again through us, as if seeing through Paradise. In Paradise, there are trees and all kinds of seeds with water flowing among them. There, he will see that from the same water, the olive draws oil, the vine draws wine, and each tree draws what is appropriate for its kind.

However, that man is of no honor in the world, though he has great honor in Heaven, betrayed by those who do not know him, and considered "as a drop from a cask."

But we are the spiritual people who choose for ourselves from the Living Water—the Euphrates that flows through the midst of Babylon—what is proper for each of us, journeying through the True Gate, which is Jesus the Blessed. Of all men, we alone are Christians, accomplishing the Mystery at the third Gate and being anointed with the Ineffable Chrism from the Horn, like David was, not from the flask of clay, like Saul, who was associated with an evil spirit of fleshly desire.

We have set down a few examples out of many. The attempts of their folly are innumerable, silly, and crazy. Since we have exposed their unknowable knowledge to the best of our ability, it seems best to also include the following. This is a Psalm they have improvised, through which they believe they sing the praises of all the mysteries of their error:

"First was Mind, the Generative Law of All;
Second to the Firstborn was Liquid Chaos;
Third, Soul received the Law through toil. Therefore, with a deer's form surrounding her, she labors at her task beneath Death's rule."Now, in control, she sees the Light; 
And now, thrown into a pitiful state, she weeps; 
Now she weeps, and now she rejoices; 
Now she weeps, and now she is judged; 
Now she is judged, and now she dies; 
Now she is born, with no escape for her; in misery, 
She enters the maze of troubles. 

And Jesus said: O Father, look! See the ongoing struggle with troubles on earth!

Far from Your Breath, she wanders! She tries to escape the bitter Chaos, 
And doesn't know how to get through. So, send me, O Father! With seals in my hands, I will descend;
Through all Aeons, I will make a path; 
Through all Mysteries, I will open a way! And I will reveal the Forms of Gods; 
I will share the secrets of the Holy Path,
And call it Gnosis.

CONCLUSION OF ANALYSIS

All this may have seemed like foolishness to the theological biases of our respected Church Father; but even in the twentieth century, I find it hard not to see the beauty of this fine Mystic Hymn, and I hope some of my readers feel the same. But let's return to considering our much-discussed Source. This Source clearly is a commentary or elaborate paraphrase of the Recitation Ode, "Whether, blessed Child of Kronos," which appears at the end (section 30) rather than at the beginning, likely displaced by Hippolytus. It is an interpretative commentary written from the perspective of the Anthropos-theory of the Mysteries (possibly originally Chaldaean), the Man-doctrine. This commentary mostly seems so coherent that we can almost believe we have most of it here, with insignificant gaps. However, Paragraphs 6 and 7 and sections 17 and 18 are clearly out of place and disrupt the continuity.THE HELLENIST COMMENTATOR

The author is clearly well-versed in various Mystery-rites, and his insights are highly valuable for studying this very obscure subject from a historical perspective. In section 8, and the Egyptian Mystery-doctrine, we encounter information particularly relevant to our current studies on Trismegistic traditions. Osiris is identified as the Heavenly Man, the Logos. Additionally, in close connection with this tradition, we find an exposition of the Hermes-doctrine, presented through allegorical interpretations of the Homeric poems. Here, we observe the evident connection between Thoth, Osiris, and Hermes—a Hermes of "Greek Wisdom," as phrased in the Recitation Ode. The commentator (section 10) confidently asserts that the Greeks derived these ideas from Egypt. 

Moreover, it is significant that immediately following the discussion of Hermes, there are sections (17 and 18) that address the "Heavenly Horn" or drinking-horn of Greek Wisdom and Anacreon's "Cup." These can be compared to the Crater (Mixing-bowl or Cup), which, according to Plato's Timaeus, the Creator used to mix elements and souls, as well as the spiritual Cup of the Mind in our Trismegistic text, "The Crater or Monas," C. H., iv. (v.). Most astonishingly, the commentator in section 9 quotes a passage from a document that, as we have indicated in a note, is very likely a Trismegistic treatise of the Poemandres type.

THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN OVERWRITERS

This commentary by S. was later revised by a Jewish Hellenistic mystic, J., whose general ideas and method of interpretation are strikingly similar to those of Philo. I believe he was a contemporary of that time and a member of one of the communities that Philo generally refers to as Therapeut.He was not a worshipper of the serpent itself, but rather a worshipper of the higher wisdom symbolized by the Serpent of Wisdom, connecting him to the Egypto-Chaldaean or Chaldaeo-Egyptian Mysteries. These mysteries are presented allegorically in the prophetic scriptures of his people. His references to the Septuagint (LXX) indicate that, like Philo, he was an Alexandrian Hellenistic Jew who used the LXX as his Targum.

J. was later interpreted by C., a Christian Gnostic who did not oppose J. or S., but claimed that his beliefs were the true fulfillment of all previous teachings. C. was somewhat boastful but acknowledged that the Christ doctrine was not new but a culmination. The New Testament references by C., especially those related to the Fourth Gospel, are particularly interesting. His references or similarities to the Synoptics are similar to those of Justin; he was likely using "Memoirs of the Apostles" rather than verbatim quotes from our established Gospels. His parallels with the Fourth Gospel also raise the question of whether he had access to "Sources" of that "Johannine" document.

On top of all our layers, we have the dismissive writings of Hippolytus, which are not necessary to discuss here. I suggest placing C. around the middle of the second century A.D.; J. lived around the first quarter of the first century A.D., contemporary with Philo; the Pagan commentator of S. lived before J., sometime in the last half of the first century B.C.; and the Recitation Ode is even earlier, anywhere between 300-50 B.C. The redactor or commentator in S. should be placed somewhere in the last half of the first century B.C.If we take only the minimum liberty, then the Poemandres type of our literature, which J. quotes as scripture, must be placed back to at least the first half of the first century B.C. in its original Greek form, as a moderate estimate. If those dates are not proven, I am fairly confident they cannot be disproven.

ZOSIMUS AND THE ANTHROPOS DOCTRINE

Furthermore, the Anthropos doctrine, which aligns with the entire commentary of our scholar, was also fundamental to the followers of the Trismegistic tradition. This can be clearly seen from an interesting passage by Zosimus, a member of what Reitzenstein calls the Poemandres Community, who lived around the end of the third century and the beginning of the fourth century A.D.

Zosimus tells us that his sources for the Anthropos doctrine, in addition to the Books of Hermes, include certain translations into Greek and Egyptian of books containing traditions of the Chaldeans, Parthians, Medes, and Hebrews. This statement is very important for the history of Gnosticism and for understanding certain elements in Trismegisticism. Although the indication of this literature is vague, it mentions four factors involved in the Hebrew tradition: Chaldean, Parthian, and Median traditions were being handed down by the Gnostic Hebrews. Translations of these books were scattered throughout Egypt, especially in the great library at Alexandria.In my opinion, there is no need, as Reitzenstein suggests (p. 106, n. 6), to specifically call these texts the "Ptolemaic Books." This label is linked to a reference in the apocryphal "Eighth Book of Moses," which mentions the Fifth Book of the "Ptolemaic Books." This book is described as containing diverse wisdom and is titled "One and All," detailing the "Genesis of Fire and Darkness." [*1]

Another source for Zosimus was the Pinax of Bitos or Bitys, which we will discuss while examining the information from Jamblichus. These sources confirm that there existed, in the first centuries B.C., a sophisticated Hellenistic doctrine about the descent of man from a divine being and his return to a heavenly state by mastering cosmic powers.

PHILO OF ALEXANDRIA ON THE MAN-DOCTRINE

This date is further supported by Philo's testimony (c. 30 B.C.-45 A.D.). He quotes the verse: "We are all sons of One Man," [*2] and addresses those who are "companions of wisdom and knowledge" as "Sons of one and the same Father—not a mortal father, but an immortal Sire, the Man of God, who, being the Reason (Logos) of the Eternal, is necessarily eternal." [*3]

Further on, he adds:

"And if a man is not yet worthy to be called a Son of God, let him strive earnestly to align himself with His First-born Reason (Logos), the Oldest Angel, who is like the chief Angel of many names; he is called Dominion, Name of God, Reason, Man-after-His-Likeness, and Seeing Israel. For this reason, I was earlier moved to praise the principles of those who say: 'We are all sons of One Man.'"Even if we are not yet worthy to be called Sons of God, we can still be Sons of His Eternal Likeness, His Most Holy Reason (Logos). Reason, the oldest of all angels, is God's image.

Philo provides further evidence, if any were needed, that the full Anthropos-doctrine was fundamental in his circle—specifically, in the Hellenistic theology or religio-philosophy of his time, at the beginning of the first century A.D. This date alone is significant for our purposes. It's not too bold to say that the concept of the Man-Mystery was crucial during the brilliant period of Hellenistic syncretism following the founding of Alexandria—an era marked by the expansion of Greek culture beyond its national borders, essentially its birth into the broader world. 

We know that the Mystery was concealed yet revealed in the traditions of the Chaldaeans, Babylonians, Magians, Phoenicians, Hebrews, Egyptians, Phrygians, Thracians, and Greeks. In short, it was fundamental in all such wisdom traditions because it was the Christ-Mystery.

Philos., v. 1-11, of which I published a preliminary translation under the heading "Selections from the 'Philosophumena,'" in The Theosophical Review (August and September 1893), xii. 559-569, xiii. 42-52, and a summary in F. F. F., pp. 198-206.L. Duncker and F. G. Schneidewin (Gottingen, 1859); and edited by P. Cruice (Paris, 1860). The Philosophumena was written around 222 A.D.

The worship of the serpent, according to H.

Compare the unusual saying found only in Matthew 10:16: "Be as wise as serpents." The text can be slightly corrected by H.'s summary in chapter 9, but the phrase "para ton aytun logon" remains a mystery. The Celestial Adam, also known as Adam Kadmon in Kabalistic tradition, or the Intelligible Cosmos in Hellenistic theology. See Cruice's note on this. Or hymns with deep meanings. That is, Man as the Cause and Substance of everything. That is, presumably, "names of power" (in Egyptian); the Adam who gave names to all the animals. Geryon, the three-headed or three-bodied Giant, who is important in the myth of Hercules. Or spiritual, psychic, and earthly. That is, the learning to know. Compare section 25, J. That is, as we will see later, C.

Celsus (around 150-175 A.D.) mentions groups of Harpocratians—worshippers of Horus—some of whom trace their tradition to Salome, others to Mariamne, and others to Martha (Origen, Against Celsus, book 5, chapter 62). This suggests an Egyptian origin. For Salome and Maria or Miriam (Mariamne), the Sisters of Jesus, see D. J. L., page 405 and following; for Martha, Our Lady, see page 375 and following. In the Gnostic Acts of Philip, Mariamne or Mariamme (both names appear in the manuscripts according to R. A. Lipsius, The Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles—Brunswick, 1884—volume 3, page 12), is Philip's "virgin sister" and plays an important role as a prophetess. She is to Philip what Thekla is to Paul, or Helen to Simon.Compare this with the "sister wife" whom Paul mentions having the right to take along, just like "the rest of the Apostles and the Brethren of the Lord and Cephas" (1 Corinthians 9:5; D. J. L., 229). Salmon (in the article "Mariamne" from Smith and Wace's Dictionary of Christian Biography, vol. iii, p. 830) refers to Mary Magdalene from the Pistis Sophia, who is the main questioner of the Master and His favorite disciple, and the sister of Martha. According to Clement of Alexandria in Book VI of his lost work, The Institutions, the tradition of Gnosis from James, the Brother of the Lord, claims that "The Lord imparted the Gnosis to James the Just, to John, and Peter, after His resurrection; they passed it on to the rest of the Apostles, and they to the Seventy" (Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History, ii. 1; cf. D. J. L., 226).

From this point on, we use the revised critical text of Reitzenstein (pp. 83-98), who includes an apparatus criticus of the emendations and conjectures of various editions of our only manuscript. However, R. does not provide a translation. Isaiah liii. 8 has the same reading as the Septuagint. Also, see section 25, J.

A remark by the writer of S., divided into Texts and Commentary, is noted. The phrase "he says" could be from any later editor; I have marked them all as H. to avoid further confusion.

"Bursts forth," inspirations, revelations, or mysteries. In Greek mythology, the son of Apollo and the daughter of Minos, born in Libya, hints at a connection with ancient Cretan civilization. Garamas, also known as Amphithemis (see Roscher's Lexicon), is mentioned in another tradition as the father of Ammon ("Garamantis Nympha," ibid.).

This passage is intriguing because it serves as both a source and a source within a source.Several scholars have already identified it as an Ode, and many have reasonably speculated that it was written by none other than Pindar himself. Furthermore, it forms part of a Hymn to Jupiter Ammon, highlighting significant Egyptian influence. Although the word order in our version of Hippolytus has often been altered to fit prose form, reconstructing most of it is straightforward and convincing. I am translating from Bergk's final revised text, as found in sections 134, 135, and 142. For some reason, R. does not mention this interesting aspect.

Footnotes:
1. Refers to the Fate-Sphere.
2. This reference, though different, relates to Ephesians 3:15.
3. Refers to the image-man, or Adam, made from "red" earth.
4. Refers to the Chaldaeans.
5. The word "tupui."
6. Refers to the Naassenes.
7. This further indicates the environment of the Naassenes. Compare with C.H., x. (xi.) 7.
8. That is, from Man (Father), Man Son of Man (Son), or Flowing Chaos (Mother)—corresponding in Greek mythology to Kronos, Zeus, and Rhea. Rhea (from "reein," meaning "to flow") represents Moist or Liquid Nature, as in Stoic philosophy; she is the unordered Earth, the Prima Materia (the First Earth, the Spouse of Heaven—Uranus), Hyle Proper, who contains the Logos. For references, see R., p. 99, note 2.
9. Compare with Exodus 8:8.
10. The previous paragraph appears to be composed of selections from S. R. (p. 85, note 1) suggests that only one aspect of the Soul is described here, with the other two aspects omitted by H.
11. Refers to the Naassenes, according to H.
12. "Morfeis" can mean either form or beauty.
13. Refers to cosmos.
14. This paragraph and section 7, along with the accompanying overworkings, seem to have been misplaced by H., according to R. (pp. 99, 100).The sudden mention of the name Attis without any introduction suggests a missing section; the shift from Assyrian to Phrygian Mysteries of the Great Mother is too abrupt. The three aspects of the Soul are distinguished as follows: (i) The union that ties it to earthly life; (ii) The union that connects it with death; and (iii) The union that links it with formal beauty, seen as the Elysian state. The love of the Mother of the Gods for the Soul signifies the "fourth state" (the turiya in Vedantic mystic psychology), or the absorption of the Soul's masculine power by its higher Feminine Nature. In Damascius' "Life of Isidores," it says: "I fell asleep, and in a vision Attis appeared to me and, on behalf of the Mother of the Gods, initiated me into the feast called Hilaria—a mystery revealing our escape from Hades." Hades, the realm of Selene, is not the same as Tartarus, the realm of Death.

Compare this with the so-called Second Epistle of Clement, xii. 2: "When asked by someone when his Kingdom would come, the Lord said: When the two become one, the outer as the inner, and the male and female are neither male nor female." Also, in The Gospel according to the Egyptians, quoted by Clement of Alexandria: "When Salome asked how long Death would prevail, the Lord said: As long as women bear children; for I have come to end the work of the Female. And Salome asked: Did I do well in not bearing children? The Lord replied: Eat every herb, but do not eat the bitter ones."When Salome asked when the things she inquired about would be revealed, the Lord replied: "When you trample upon the Garment of Shame; when the Two become One, and Male and Female are neither male nor female." This aligns with a newly discovered fragment of a lost Gospel: "His disciples asked Him: When will you reveal yourself to us, and when shall we see You? He answered: When you are stripped and unashamed." --Grenfell and Hunt, New Sayings of Jesus (London, 1904), p. 40. The context is Egyptian and ascetic, and the saying is addressed to a community, as seen in a previous saying: "Having one garment, what do you lack?" 

^153:2 Refer to Romans 1:20-23, 25-27.
^153:3 "aorata" (unseen).
^153:4 "aidios" – evidently a wordplay.
^153:5 The common Pauline text is slightly shortened here.
^154:1 Likely a reference to the Chaldaean fourfold symbol (man-eagle-lion-bull) representing the main types of animal life, which Ezekiel saw in his Vision of the Celestial Chariot, reflecting the Chaldaean Mysteries.
^154:2 Verses 24 and 25 of the Received Text are omitted.
^154:3 "asxemosune" – also meaning "formlessness."
^154:4 Compare with Exodus 5:2.
^154:5 Refers to baptism.
^154:6 It is uncertain what "they" really said. They might have argued in private that even in the foulest things, a pure soul can recognize reversed signs of the Mysteries of Purity. These things certainly need explanation, and even more so, interpretation in proportion to their foulness. The suggestion by Hippolytus that these ascetic and spiritually-minded people were as sinful as those of the Flood shows his deep-seated prejudice and self-righteousness. 

^155:1 Completion of R.
^155:2 Referring back to "Blessed Nature" from the first paragraph of 6.Here is the provided text converted into modern English, simplified, and corrected without altering its original meaning:

^155:3 See Exodus 8:6 for reference. ^155:4 At fourteen, a boy began his first initiation into the Egyptian priesthood. ^155:5 See Littre, Translation of the Works of Hippocrates, volume 1, page 396. ^155:6 This likely refers to Seed. ^155:7 However, they might have meant something very different, and maybe their analogies are not as foolish as they seemed to H.

^155:8 The material here seems to continue directly from section 5. It is summarized by H., but since there is more of S. in it than of H., we will print it as S., indicating H. when possible. ^156:1 Isis, or Nature, as the seven spheres and the eighth sphere (possibly the "black" earth). ^156:2 This refers to the Celestial Nile or Heaven-Ocean, which fertilizes Mother Nature. "The Alexandrians honored the same God as both Osiris and Adonis, according to their mystical merging of gods (syncrasia)." Damascius, "Life of Isidorus" (Phot., Bibl., 242; p. 342 a. 21, ed. Bek.). ^156:3 Refers to the Egyptians. ^156:4 Proverbs 24:16 has the same reading as the Septuagint. See also Luke 17:4: "If he sins against you seven times in a day and returns to you saying, 'I repent,' you must forgive him." This saying is apparently from the "Logia" source; see also Matthew 18:21, and compare this concept with the "repentance" of the Pistis Sophia. ^156:5 The seven planetary spheres; it may also relate to the idea of falling "stars" as souls descending into matter, according to Platonic and Hermetic doctrine. ^156:6 Probably refers to the Egyptians in their Mysteries, connecting with what is summarized by H. at the end of section 6 and beginning of section 7. ^157:1 This seems to be a logos from some Hellenistic scripture. In the evidence of Zosimus, which we include at the end of our Trismegistic Fragments, he quotes (sections 15 and 7) from the "Inner Door," a lost treatise of Hermes Trismegistus, as follows: "For the Son of God, having power over all things, becoming all things He wills, appears as He wills to each person."

Based on the original text, here is a modernized and simplified version without altering its meaning: 

S. quotes the original logos, which I believe is part of the "Poemandres" type of Trismegistic literature. This indicates that this type existed before S. This supports our attribution of "they declare" to the Egyptians and their Mysteries (Trismegisticism being the Hellenized form of these Mysteries), and also the completion of R. at the end of the first paragraph of section 7 above.

^157:2 Compare Matthew 19:17, Mark 10:18, and Luke 18:19. The first part matches Mark and Luke, while the second part matches Matthew (excluding "the" before "Good"). The original command, "Call me not Good," has completely vanished from this tradition.

^157:3 A different form from Matthew 5:45, but the same idea; for the other tradition, see Luke 6:35.

^158:1 Compare Matthew 5:15, Mark 4:21, Luke 8:16, and Luke 11:33.

^158:2 Compare Matthew 10:27 and Luke 12:3.

^158:3 This refers to symbolically distinguished statues of Hermes.

^158:4 The text has errors; but see Pausanias, VI. 26.5, where he mentions that the people of Cyllene greatly revere an image of Hermes, which is simply a phallus on a pedestal. This symbolic figure is also noted by Artemidorus and Lucian. See J. G. Frazer's Pausanias (London, 1898), vol. 4, p. 110.

^159:1 Psychagogue and psychopomp—meaning the leader and evoker of souls, who takes souls out of the body and returns them to it.

^159:2 "Mneste'run" means "recalling to mind" and also "suitors." See Odyssey 24.1 and following.

^159:3 Empedocles, in "On Purifications," says: "I have fallen here on the earth to associate with mortals!" (Diels 119; Stein 390; Karsten 11; Fairbanks, "First Philosophers of Greece," p. 206).

^159:4 The Naassenes, according to H.

^159:5 Refers to the souls.

^159:6 Some editors believe this should be Ialdabaoth.The name appears in Justinus's system (Hipp., Philos., v. 26) as Esaddaios, which is clearly a transliteration of El Shaddai. Esaddaios is one of the twelve Paternal Angels, the Sons of Elohim, the creator of the physical world, and Eden, the Maternal Potency or Nature. This refers to the "cosmos of species" rather than the "cosmos of wholes." See section 17 below for the passage from C. that H. references. Compare this to Ptah-Hephaistos, the Fire Demiurge, the Fourth, in the London Inscription mentioned in Chapter VI above.

Note 1: Sc. Hermes.
Note 2: The continuation of the above quotation--Odyssey, xxiv. 2 ff.
Note 3: Cf. Corpus Hermeticum, i. 14: "He who has power over the lives of the cosmos."
Note 4: Psalm ii. 9--same reading as the Septuagint.
Note 5: Could also mean "regain memory" or "become suitors."
Note 6: Ephesians v. 14--a shortened form of the current Pauline text; Paul seems to be quoting an older writing. If the intermediate reading (epipsausei for epifausei) is correct (see W. H., Ap. 125), it would mean "Christ shall touch thee" with His rod.
Note 7: Cf. Plutarch, De Iside et Osiride, xxxiv. Plutarch mentions that Osiris, or the Logos, is symbolized as Ocean and Water, and that Thales got his idea of primal "Water as the cause of things" from the Egyptians. The initiated priest of Apollo and learned mythologist states: "The Greeks say that 'son' (yion) comes from 'water' (ydatos) and 'to moisten' (ysai), and they call Dionysus 'Hyes' (yen) as Lord of Moist Nature, he being the same as Osiris." Stoll in Roscher's Lexicon says that "Hyes" and "Hye" were names for Dionysus and Semele, meaning the "Moistener" and the "Moistened." The nymphs who raised Bacchus were also called Hyades (Pherecydes, 46; p. 108, ed. Sturz). Hyes was also a common name for Zeus as the god of rain. See also Lobeck, Aglaophamus, 782 and 1045 ff.Anecd., Bekk., p. 202: Some say that Hyes is the same as Attis, while others believe Hyes is Dionysus, because "Zeus poured (yse) ambrosia upon him." One of Bacchus's names was Ambrosia (Pherecy., ibid.; Non., xxi. 20). I suggest that the mystic cry "Hye Kye" meant "O Moistener beget!" ^161:1 Ps. xix. 4. This refers to the Sound (= Word) of the Heavens; also quoted in Rom. x. 18. ^161:2 See also Od., xxiv. 5. And compare with Hamlet, I. i.: "The sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets." ^161:3 Od., ibid. ff. ^161:4 Ps. cxviii. 22. Quoted in Matt. xxi. 42; Mark xii. 10; Luke xx. 17; Acts iv. 11. ^162:1 Taken by C. from S. and J., section 20; but I believe C. misunderstood the true meaning of the "corner-stone" in the brain. ^162:2 See Eph. iii. 15. ^162:3 Is. xxviii. 16—reading entassu for emballu of LXX.; also quoted in Eph. ii. 20 and 1 Pet. ii. 7. ^162:4 Sc. Isaiah. ^162:5 Completion of the missing part by R.

^162:6 xarakuma—a technical term also for the "Gnostic" supernal Horos or Boundary. ^162:7 Dan. ii. 15. ^162:8 Compare the "complaints of the souls" in the K.K. fragments. ^162:9 Od., xxiv. 9 f.

(W. and H. text.) ^163:4 The final quotation within the quotation is also from Ps. lxxxii. 6. Here, we have a scripture quotation ("what is written"), glossed by J. with his interpretation, which is already an interpretation of an Old Testament text. It is not just a halacha, to use a Talmudic term, but an authoritative revelation of the Jewish Gnosis. ^163:5 John iii. 6. ^163:6 Sc. the Naassenes, according to H.

^164:1 I am convinced this originally came from J., not C.—being LXX. for Joshua.This paragraph summarizes Section S. See the next Section S.

"Absileytos" likely refers to those who have learned to govern themselves, known as the "self-taught" race, as described by Philo. 

Eusebius, in his work "Preparation for the Gospel" (Book IX, chapters 28 and 29), quotes Alexander Cornelius (Polyhistor), who lived around 100 B.C. Alexander preserved several verses from a tragedy titled "The Leading Forth," which tells the story of Moses and the Exodus. This tragedy was written by a Hebrew poet named Ezechiel, who wrote in Greek, possibly from Alexandria. In Ezechiel's tragedy, characters like Mariam, Sepphora, and Jothor appear. These names, along with Madiam, are the Greek Septuagint (LXX) forms of the names Miriam, Jethro, Zipporah, and Midian found in the Authorized Version (A.V.) of the Bible.

Refer to Homer's "Iliad," Book 15, line 189.

Compare with Luke 8:10. Luke seems to preserve the original reading more accurately than Matthew 13:13 or Mark 4:12. This Saying refers back to Isaiah 6:9.

Refer to section 30 J.

The three names are based on the Hebrew text of Isaiah 28:13 in the Authorized Version (A.V.): "But the Word of the Lord was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, there a little." The Septuagint (LXX) translates this as: "And the oracle of the Lord shall be to them tribulation on tribulation, hope on hope, still little still little." According to Philo, this means: "And the oracle [instrument of the Logos] of God will be to them tribulation upon tribulation, hope upon hope, still little still little." See Epiphanius, "Panarion," section 25.4. The phrases "saulasau saulasau" translates to "tribulation on tribulation," "kaulakau kaulakau" translates to "hope on hope," and "zeesar zeesar" translates to "still little still little," referring to the small number of the Regenerate. Compare with "Pistis Sophia," chapter 354: "One out of a thousand, and two out of ten thousand."Refer to Salmon's article, "Caulacau," in Smith and Wace's Dictionary of Christian Biography, volume 1, pages 424 and following. It is important to note that Epiphanius attributes the origin of these names to the Nicolaitans. In Hebrew, the equivalent name would be Balaamites; and Balaam or Bileam (Nico-laus) was one of the Rabbinical nicknames for Jesus. See D. J. L., page 188. 

The following paragraph seems to have been misplaced by J. or C., as section 19 directly connects with the explanation concerning the ithyphallic Hermes. See R. 100, note 4. 

Men was the Phrygian god of the moon. Refer to Drexler's excellent article in Roscher, volume 2, pages 2687-2770. 

There is a word-play on "keras" (horn) that cannot be translated into English. 

John 1:3-4 is referenced here. The current text uses "nothing," but it must have been different in the original text C. used. 

Compare this with the logos from The Book of the Great Logos according to the Mystery: "Jesus, the Living One, answered and said: Blessed is the man who knows this Word (Logos), and has brought down Heaven, lifted the Earth upwards, and becomes the Middle, for the Middle is 'nothing.'" --Schmidt (C.), Gnostic Writings in Coptic from the Codex Brucianus (Leipzig, 1892), page 144; and Coptic-Gnostic Writings (Leipzig, 1905), page 259. 

This refers to the world of phenomena, or the cosmos of species, not of genera or wholes. 

The fourth Demiurgic Power of the Sensible World was Esaldaios, as mentioned in J., section 12. The details are too vague to determine the "measures" and "numbers" of the system accurately. However, the "third and fourth" are both "fiery"—the former providing "light," the latter "heat." Compare section 23 C., which mentions the third Gate or entry to the third Heaven. This third Heaven, being the third from below, corresponds with the first aetheric sphere, with presumably three spheres before the fourth or middle, the "Fiery Ruler.""Heavenly Horn of Men." ^167:2 See Genesis 44:5. ^167:3 Bergk includes these verses among the Anacreontica, number 63, page 835. See Anacreon, i. 10 (Bergk, 50, 10). ^167:4 The last line is reconstructed by Cruice. See Anacreon, xxvi. 25, 26. Was Omar Khayyam, then, a reincarnation of Anacreon, or did they share the same spirit? ^167:5 See John 2:11. Our quotation, however, differs significantly from the familiar Textus Receptus. ^167:6 See Luke 17:21. ^167:7 See Matthew 13:44. ^167:8 See Matthew 13:33 and Luke 13:20. ^168:1 This seems to connect directly with the end of section 16. See R. 100, note 4. ^168:2 S. probably had "For," which J. glossed into "Moreover." ^168:3 But this "statue," as we have seen, was simply the ithyphallus. ^168:4 Or the Archetypal Man. ^168:5 Or, generated or born from Above. ^168:6 See John 6:53, which reads in Textus Receptus: "Amen, Amen, I say to you, unless you eat the Flesh of the Son of Man and drink His Blood, you have no Life in yourselves." ^168:7 See Matthew 20:22 and Mark 10:38 (where the phrase is put as a question). ^168:8 See John 8:21 and 13:33. It is notable that in the text of our Gospels these sayings are addressed to the Jews; C., however, takes them as sayings addressed to the disciples. It is possible that this might be a "source" for the Fourth Gospel! ^169:1 These "tribes" were not the Jewish tribes, ten of which did not return, but twelve typical natures of men, and something else. ^169:2 See Immisch's excellent article, "Kureten and Korybanten," in Roscher, volume ii, pages 1587-1628. ^169:3 Korubas, the Lord of the Corybantes, or frenzied priests of Cybele, is thus interpreted through mystical word-play as "he who descends from the head." ^169:4 See C., section 14. ^169:5 Apparently a quotation from some Jewish apocryphon. See John 5:37: "You have never heard His voice nor seen His form." ^170:1 See Psalm 28:10. ^170:2 Ibid., verse 3. ^170:3 Conflation of the Septuagint version of Psalm.Here is the text converted into modern English, corrected, and simplified while retaining the original meaning:

Psalm 24:17 and Psalm 21:21. A paraphrase from the Septuagint--Isaiah 41:8. A paraphrase from the Septuagint--Isaiah 43:1. Isaiah, or the Word speaking through the prophet. Isaiah 43:1. Isaiah. A paraphrase from the Septuagint--Isaiah 49:15. Isaiah 49:16. Psalm 23:7 and 9. Psalm 23:10. Referring to a "Serpent." Psalm 21:6. Psalm 23:10 and 8. Referring to the psalmist, or rather, the Logos through the psalmist. Job 40:27. Genesis 28:7. Referring to Jacob. Genesis 28:17. Compare with John 10:9— "true" does not appear in the traditional text. Referring to "Jacob" in the Philonic sense. This is the Zeus Phrygius mentioned by Diodorus (iii. 58) and Eustathius (565, 3). See also R. 163, note 3, and Zwei relig. Fragen, 104, note 3.

See Ephesians 2:17. Compare with what underlies Matthew 23:27, Luke 11:44, and Acts 23:3. Compare with "Jesus, the Living [One]" mentioned in the introduction to the newly discovered Sayings, and also throughout the introduction (apparently an excerpt from another document) to the First Book of Ieou in the Codex Brucianus. Compare with what underlies Matthew 27:52, 53. Some words appear to be missing, corresponding to the final clause of the last sentence in S. See R., p. 101. Compare with 2 Corinthians 12:2-4. Compare with 1 Corinthians 2:13, 14. Compare with John 6:44. Instead of "Heavenly Father," the Textus Receptus reads "the Father who sent me." Compare this with the longest of the newly discovered sayings concerning "those who draw us" towards self-knowledge or the "kingship within." (Grenfell and Hunt, op. cit., p. 15.) Compare with Matthew 7:21. Compare with Matthew 21:31. The Textus Receptus reads "The Kingdom of God." Refers to perfection, completion, or initiation; also taxes—here a mystical synonym for fullness or words. Refers to collectors of dues. Compare with 1 Corinthians 10:11.The underlying message in Matthew 13:3 and following is the same as in Mark 4:3 and following, and in Luke 8:5 and following. This is slightly paraphrased from the Septuagint version of Deuteronomy 31:20. The text suggests that individuals who are "self-taught" are free from the control of destiny or karmic bonds.

Refer to Matthew 3:10 and Luke 3:9. Also, see Hippolytus, Philosophy, vi. 16, where he criticizes the "Simonian" Gnosis. This implies they are Sons of the Logos. Refer to the note on the third Ruler in section 17 C.

The text likely refers to the Phrygians. If our attribution to J. is correct (R. attributes it to C.), we might be looking at a message from the Phrygian Mysteries. This might possibly be assigned to C., but C. usually comments on J. and does not lead, and the terminology is that of J. and not of C.

A simple form of Matthew 7:6 might include a mystical word-play on the Eleusinian phrase "ye kue," which could mean "pig" (a synonym for "swine" and "dog"). This section seems to be misplaced, and section 25 probably followed section 23 immediately in the original text; the contrast of Fruitful and Unfruitful follows the contrast of Dead and God in section 22.

The term "ai-polos" commonly means "goat-herd." S. might have used the term "ignorant." The term "aeipolos" means "always turning." Refer to Plato, Cratylus, 408 C, D.

This is somewhat unclear. However, Mozley's article "Polus" in Smith, Wayte, and Marindin's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities (London, 1891), ii. 442, 443, indicates that in Plato's Timaeus 40 B and Aristotle's De Caelo ii. 14, "polos" refers to the axis of heaven and earth around which everything revolves. In De Caelo ii. 2, "poloi" refers to the north and south poles in the modern sense. Compare also the rubric in one of the rituals in the Greek Magic Papyri--C. Wessely, Greek Magic Papyri, in Memoirs of the Academy, philosophical-historical class, xxxvi.In Vienna, 1888, it is said that the Sun will move towards the Pole. At this time, the theurgist will see Seven Virgins, representing the Seven Fortunes of Heaven, and Seven Youths with bull heads, who are the Pole-lords of Heaven, making the axis turn (661-670). This can be compared to the "cylinder" idea in the fragment of K. K. Then, the Great God will appear, dressed in a white robe and trousers, with a gold crown on his head. He will hold the golden shoulder of a heifer, symbolizing the Bear that keeps the heavens turning in the right seasons. This God will deliver an oracle, and the theurgist will receive the gift of divination. This tradition is particularly interesting because it includes a Magian element, indicated by the "trousers," which connects closely with Phrygia and its cult, most associated with the Mithraic traditions and the Mother of the Gods. 

In the Proteus myth, Egypt is represented by the Nile, also known as the "Great Green," or the Heaven Ocean. Proteus was considered the messenger or servant of Poseidon, who was notably the special God of Plato's Atlantis. 

The term "piprasketai" is a synonym of "puleitai," meaning "coming and going" or "moving about," and also "is sold." However, the relevance of this remark is unclear unless it was misunderstood by the "ignorant." 

References: Isaiah 54:1 and also quoted in Galatians 4:27. See also Philo, De Execratione, section 7; M. ii. 435, P. 936 (Ri.).When the soul is overwhelmed by many passions and filled with vices—such as pleasures, appetites, folly, intemperance, unrighteousness, and injustice—it becomes weak, sick, and nearly dies. However, if the soul stops producing these vices or even rejects them, it transforms into a pure state. In this state, it receives divine inspiration and cultivates admirable qualities that nature values highly, such as prudence, courage, temperance, justice, holiness, piety, and other virtues.

There are clear similarities between the ideas of J. and Philo. Could J. have been part of Philo's group, or did Philo promote the ideas of J.'s group? Is it possible that J. represents a mystical, allegorical exercise by a broad-minded Hellenistic Jewish mystic?

^178:1 Refer to Matthew 2:18, which is based on Jeremiah 31:15. However, the reading in the T. R. is not the same as in the LXX, and C. supports the Gospel text over the LXX.

^178:2 This indicates a very objective mindset from J. It might be an addition by C.

^178:3 Refer to Jeremiah 17:9.

^178:4 This seems to be a quote from a mystical Gnostic text.

^178:5 See Cumont (F.), Mysteries of Mithra (Brussels, 1898). In the depictions of the bull-slaying myth of Mithras, the bull’s tail often ends in a cluster of wheat, varying in number from one to seven. In the Bundahish, all things are generated from the body, especially from the spinal marrow, of the slain bull. Sometimes, the wheat-ears are shown flowing like blood from the wound above the heart inflicted by Mithras, the Bull-slayer.The constellation of the Wheat-ear in the Virgin, believed to bring good harvests, likely represents the same idea (see Eratosthenes, Catasterisms, 9). Refer to the same source, volume i, pages 202, 205, note 2. The wheat-ear symbolized the "generative seed"—sperm in animals and humans, and a mystery in humans. Mithraism had a close connection with the Phrygian Mystery Cult; in fact, the Magna Mater Mysteries were used for initiating women, who were excluded from the Mithraic rites.

^179:2 Refers to the hierophant initiate of the Great Mother. 
^179:3 "ypo pollui puri" translates to "with much fire." This likely refers to the bright illumination of the Temple, also called the Initiation Hall (telesterion), the Mystic Enclosure (mystikos sekos)—probably the inner court surrounding the Temple, the Great Hall (megaron), or Palace (anaktoron). As Hatch states in his tenth Hibbert Lecture of 1888: "At night, there were mystic plays: symbolic dramas. The torches were extinguished; they stood outside the Temple [likely in the Mystic Enclosure] in silence and darkness. The door opened—a blaze of light—revealing the drama." (Hatch, E., The Influence of Greek Ideas and Usages upon the Christian Church, 4th ed., London, 1892). See also my "Notes on the Eleusinian Mysteries," in The Theosophical Review (April 1898), volume 22, page 151.

^180:2 "elthomen," a verb forming its tenses from "sqrter" and "sqrtelyth," with "eleysis" also meaning "coming."
^180:3 Emended by Keil.
^180:4 "anelthein."
^180:5 This is all mystical word-play; "anaktoreion" is derived from the same root as "anax," meaning "king." Compare with...The Anaktoron, or Palace, is the name of the Eleusinian Temple of Initiation. Heracleitus, in Fragment 25, suggests that "deaths" can also be interpreted as destinies, fates, or dooms. The first path is implied here. These verses are from an unknown poet, possibly Parmenides or Pamphus of Athens, as discussed by both Schneidewin and Cruice. The verses refer to Persephone and the Greater Mysteries, where the candidate likely underwent a symbolic death and resurrection.

The term "true virility" (apersenumenoys) is equivalent to ap-androymenoys and does not mean "demasculati," as translated by Schneidewin and Cruice. For the "death" and "casting away of garments," see the Mystery Ritual in The Acts of John (F. F. F., 431-434). For the "Virginal Spirit," refer to the passages on the Sacred Marriage in the chapter on Philo's main doctrines. There is a loose reference to LXX--Isaiah 7:14, and possibly "Eternity of Eternities."

This text seems to connect with the "Fruitful" section 25. In the Hymn "Whether blest Child," the "cut wheat-ear" that Amygdalos brought forth is mentioned. This refers to the First Man. The Vulgate translates this as "Almond-tree." In the Mithriaca, Mithras is represented as born from a Tree in the ancient myth, as noted by Cumont.

The reading "oionei diafuzonta" suggests "the Egg throbbing apart" or in separation, linking to the Orphic (Chaldaean) tradition. The term "die'myxe" is synonymous with "I tore myself asunder," frequently found in the Pistis Sophia. This refers to the Man, Son of Man.The somewhat boastful tone, shown in several earlier passages, likely indicates C.; however, it might also be attributed to J.

"amuxai" is a play on the word "Amygdalos."

This means "scarifications."

Compare with John 1:3, but read "oyden" instead of "oyde en" as in W. H.

The Piper; specifically, the player on the syrinx or seven-reeded Pan-pipe. Compare the Mystery Ritual in The Acts of John: "I would pipe; dance all of you!" and "We have piped unto you and ye have not danced" (Matt. 11:17 = Luke 7:27).

Or harmonized; meaning cosmic or ordered. Compare with C. H., i. 15: "For being above the Harmony, He became a slave harmonized"; also Orph. Hymn., viii. 11; and also Acts of John, where the Logos is described as "Wisdom in harmony."

Compare with John 4:24.

A combination of John 4:21 and 23. The "mountain," when used mystically, signifies the inner "Mount of initiation." Jerusalem in the text signifies the Jerusalem Below. True worshippers worship in the Jerusalem Above.

With slight verbal omissions, the opening lines down to "foundation" are identical with the beginning of The Great Apocalypse or Announcement of the "Simonian" tradition, an interesting document from which some quotes have been preserved by Hippolytus elsewhere (Philos., vi. 9). The "Simonian" tradition was considered by all the Church Fathers as the source of all "heresy"; but modern criticism views The Great Announcement as a late document of the Christian Gnosis. However, the quotation of this document by J. makes this opinion, in my view, untenable. If my analysis holds, The Great Announcement is thus proven to be pre-Christian, according to the traditional date. I also think that in this quotation itself, we already see the work of a commentator and not the original form of the Apocalypse.Refer to section 16 J.  
See Matt. 13:31; Mark 4:30; Luke 13:18.  
This likely refers to the Heavens in the Psalm, meaning the Aeons and other entities above.

The following Ode has been reconstructed by Wilamowitz in Hermes, vol. 37, page 328. Our translation is based on his reconstruction.  
The term "akousma" means a hearing, instruction, lesson, discourse, or sermon, often used for Pythagoras' public lectures. It also means a song or even a "singer" or "bard." Their singers (akousmata) are known as 'bards' (Posidonius, as quoted in Athenaeus, 6.49). The Hearers (oi akousmatikoi) were the Probationers in Pythagoras' School. Schneidewin and Cruice adopt Hermann's "emendation" to "akrisma" (mutilation), but I prefer the Codex's reading, referring to the "mournful piper" or Logos in the flowing "discord" of Rhea or Chaos, and thus the "song" that Rhea begins as she transitions from Chaos to Cosmos.

Kerkidi (unintelligible term).Hippolytus, in Phil., v. 17, discusses the system of the Sethiani (S. 198, 36). Both S. and C. correctly translate "spina" as "backbone," though it has mistakenly been translated as "spur." Plutarch, in De Is. et Os., lxii. 3, mentions that the Egyptians called the loadstone the "bone of Horus." Horus is notably the "hawk" or "golden hawk." Refer to Budge's Gods of the Egyptians, ii. 246, where he cites Manetho as Plutarch's main source, stating that the loadstone was called the "bone of Horus" and iron the "bone of Typho" by the Egyptians. In the Ritual's chapter on deification of the body parts, the deceased's backbone is identified with Set's backbone (xlii. 12). Elsewhere (cviii. 8), the deceased is said to "depart having the harpoon of iron in him," which suggests the contrast between the black backbone of death and the golden backbone of life.

^189:3 See John ix. 1; "blind from birth," perhaps mystically meaning "blind due to genesis." Compare with the "blind accuser" in the Trismegistic treatise quoted by Zosimus in our Fragments. ^189:4 John i. 9. ^189:5 This is clearly attributed to J., or rather his "Simonian" source, as it follows directly after the sentence about "every nature selecting." Either C. has removed the opening words of J.'s paragraph and added his own explanation, or H. has distorted the text. ^190:1 A gap in the Codex, which S. and C. have filled in.

Schneidewin, for reasons not stated, completely omits it from his Latin translation. ^191:1 This attribution might be debatable, but it aligns more with J.'s thought than with C.'s, so I have assigned it to J.The text pertains to the same circles where we find the sources of J. The term "genikos" might simply mean "general." The Codex uses "elafon," but Miller suggests correcting it to "elafoy." This might be a parallel to the "lost sheep" idea. It could also relate to the phrases found on the golden tablets in the tombs of "Orphic" initiates in ancient Sybaris: "A kid, you have fallen into the milk" (from the "Timpone grande" Tablet in the Naples Museum, Kaibel, C.I.G.I.S., 642); and "A kid, I have fallen into milk" (from the "Campagno" Tablet, ibid., 641, and Append., p. 668). However, this connection is unclear and more likely suggests the "fawn-skin" of the Bacchic initiates (see my work "Orpheus," "The Fawn-skin," pp. 243 ff., for an explanation). Cruice suggests substituting "ydaron" ("watery"), but there's no reason to reject the Codex reading entirely, especially since Cruice's suggestion violates the principle that the more difficult reading is preferable.

The term "basileian" means kingdom or kingship. The Codex reads "eipen diesous esor," which might be a corrupted form of "Iau Zeesar" (Iao Zeesar). Cruice believes this refers to the breath of God's anger, but it likely refers to the Holy Spirit of God. The soul is referred to as the "wandering sheep." This can be compared to the "bitter Water," "Darkness," or "Chaos" in the Sethian system (see Hippolytus, "Philosophumena," v. 19; and the note to the comments following Hermes-Prayer v., p. 92). The Logos, in descending through the spheres, takes on the forms of all the Powers. There is a possibility that the original Hymn had "Naas" (Naan) instead of "Gnosis" (Gnusin).

Wilamowitz's hesitant attribution of this to the reign of Hadrian (117-138 A.D.) lacks any objective support. Reitzenstein himself (p. 165) would place it in the second century B.C.Here is the text converted into modern English:

---

Incidentally, it should be noted that this analysis disproves Salmon's argument ("The Cross-references in the Philosophumena," Hermathena, 1885, v. 389 ff.) that the major Gnostic systems, which we know only through Hippolytus, were the work of a single forger who deceived the heresy-hunting Bishop of Portus. Although we find this argument to be one of the clearest examples of "even Homer nods," it was nonetheless largely supported by Stahelin (Die gnostische Quellen Hippolyts in seiner Hauptschrift gegen die Haeretiken, 1890; in Texte u. Untersuchungen, VI.), who meticulously reviewed all the evidence presented by Salmon. However, De Faye has effectively highlighted the general weaknesses of this extraordinary forgery hypothesis in his Introduction à l'Étude du Gnosticisme au IIe et au IIIe Siècle (Paris, 1903), pp. 24 ff., though De Faye also argues for a later date.

PHILO OF ALEXANDRIA AND HELLENISTIC THEOLOGY

CONCERNING PHILO AND HIS METHOD

Given that studying the Trismegistic literature is essentially a study in Hellenistic theology, any introduction to this literature must emphasize the importance of carefully reviewing the writings of Philo, the famous Jewish Hellenist of Alexandria. Additionally, it should highlight the numerous parallels between the basic principles of this Jewish philosopher-mystic and the main ideas in our texts.To cover this topic in detail would require an entire book, but since we are limited to a single chapter, we can only provide a few general outlines. Most of our focus will be on Philo's concept of the Logos, or Divine Reason, the core idea of his universe. When examining Philo's extensive writings, it is crucial to understand that we are not looking at a unique system created by one person, nor a new approach. Philo’s work builds on a tradition of predecessors. Although Philo is the most renowned due to the preservation of his writings, he follows in their footsteps. His method of allegorical interpretation is not new, nor is his theology. Essentially, Philo is an "apologist"; his writings defend Jewish myths and prophetic statements by interpreting them allegorically using the language of the prevailing cultured Alexandrian religio-philosophy, which blends philosophy and theology.

As Edersheim notes in his excellent article, this fusion of synagogue faith with Greek thinking does not mean that the substance and spirit were purely Jewish, with only the form being Greek. Instead, it often seems that the substance was Greek and only the form was Hebrew. However, Edersheim may not fully recognize that "Greek thinking" in Hellenistic circles was already heavily theologized and intertwined with concepts of apocalypse and revelation. This blend was inevitable in Egypt, as evidenced by our current study.Philo followed the common practice among educated people of his time by treating the stories of the patriarchs as myths and interpreting difficult narratives as ethical mythology. This was a method used in the religio-philosophy of the era, which employed allegorical interpretation to reveal deeper meanings and combat irreligion. Philo's significance lies not in his originality but in preserving ideas that existed before him. As Edersheim notes, Philo's writings don't seem original; he often references the allegorical interpretations of others and recognized principles of allegorism. He also lists different allegorical interpretations of the same subjects, indicating the presence of a Hellenistic school of interpretation.

This approach wasn't unique to interpreting "the myths of Israel" by Hellenistic Jews but was prevalent throughout the cultured religious world of the time, especially in the Hellenistic schools in Egypt. Essentially, Philo's philosophy often dealt with myths that had already been philosophically interpreted before he applied them to Hebrew stories. Philo's writings and the Trismegistic sermons share a common background in Hellenistic theology or theosophy and use similar language. Like his contemporaries, Philo didn't engage in criticism as understood today; he was a staunch defender of the Old Covenant documents, believing them to be the inerrant words of God, and even considered the Greek translation to be divinely inspired.Despite being a thinker, he faced challenges similar to those we encounter today but in a much clearer way. The concepts of God, the world order, and human nature were so advanced in his time compared to the often crude and unappealing depictions in his people's ancient scriptures that he couldn't claim these texts as the ultimate wisdom from God for the educated people he addressed. To resolve these issues, he used allegorical interpretation, infusing the texts with the highest philosophical and religious ideas of his era.

Lacking an understanding of the philosophy of history, the history of religion, or modern literary criticism, he did not question whether the ancient writers intended their stories to be taken as myths with hidden meanings. Nor did he consider, as we do today, that these writers might have adapted myths from other cultures into their own history. Instead, he absolved them of all responsibility and removed the human element by theorizing that they were mere passive instruments of Divine inspiration.

However, even Philo couldn't fully maintain this absolutist view of inspiration. He struggled to consistently attribute the same level of inspiration to "Moses," whom he believed wrote the entire Pentateuch. Consequently, in the "Five Fifths," he created a threefold classification of inspiration: (i) The Sacred Oracles "spoken directly by God through His interpreter, the prophet"; (ii)...**Prophecies delivered as questions and answers:**  
(i) Some were delivered in a question-and-answer format.  
(ii) Others came directly from Moses, inspired and influenced by the deity.

**Philo's Inclusiveness:**
What is especially pleasing is that Philo welcomed the great Greek philosophers into his sacred assembly. Although he gave Moses the highest honor, he treated him as a first among equals. This broad-minded tolerance was soon forgotten in the intense theological conflicts that followed.

**The Significance of Philo's Writings:**
Philo's writings are incredibly important because the last decade of his life coincided with the emergence of Christianity in the Graeco-Roman world, largely due to Paul's vigorous efforts. Philo was born between 30 and 20 B.C. and died around 45 A.D. While there is no direct reference to Christianity in his extensive works, his language shares many similarities with that of the New Testament writers. Both used the common language of Hellenistic theology, and their ideas often overlap remarkably. Philo was a prominent figure in the large Jewish community of Alexandria, which comprised two of the city's five wards. His brother, Alexander, led the largest banking firm in Egypt's capital, making him akin to the Rothschild of that era.The firm's operations included arranging loans for the Imperial House, while the banker was a personal friend of the Emperor, and his sons married into the family of the Jewish King Agrippa. Although Philo preferred a contemplative life, he actively participated in the social life of the capital. 

At a time when his fellow Jews in the city faced severe anti-Semitism, with their lives in danger, homes ransacked, and ancient privileges taken away, the elderly Philo was chosen to lead an embassy to Caius Caligula in A.D. 40. Philo was in a position to be well-informed about the world of philosophy, literature, and religion, not just in Alexandria but wherever Jewish enterprise, which dominated global commerce, reached. Alexandria received news from all over the world, and much of the mercantile fleet was owned by Jews. Therefore, Philo is the ideal person to consult about the ideas in our Trismegistic tractates. 

Regarding the Mysteries, Philo writes about those who lead a contemplative life: 

"This natural class of people is found in many parts of the inhabited world; for both the Grecian and non-Grecian world must share in the perfect Good."

In Egypt, he notes, there were many of them in every province, especially around Alexandria.Philo tells us about certain men:

"All those, whether Greek or non-Greek, who practice wisdom and live blameless, irreproachable lives, committed to doing no harm and not retaliating when harmed," avoid the conflicts of ordinary life, "because they are passionate about living a peaceful, contention-free life." Thus, they are "excellent observers of nature and everything in it; they study the earth, sea, air, and sky, and their minds align with the orderly motion of the moon, sun, and all the stars, both changing and constant. Their bodies may be grounded on earth, but their souls have wings, soaring through the ether and observing the powers above, as if they were true citizens of the universe, living in the cosmos as their city. Such citizens are companions of Wisdom, listed among the virtuous, who oversee the common good... "Though few in number, these men keep the hidden spark of Wisdom alive secretly in cities around the world, so that Virtue may not be completely extinguished and disappear from humanity."

Additionally, speaking of those who are good and wise, Philo says:

"This entire group has voluntarily given up possessing anything in abundance, thinking little of material desires."Athletes are people who take great care of their bodies, making them strong and vigorous, essentially fortifying their bodies against their souls. In contrast, those who follow this spiritual discipline become pale, thin, and almost skeletal, sacrificing their physical strength for the sake of their souls. They focus so much on their spiritual well-being that their bodies seem to dissolve, becoming more like their souls, freeing their minds from the physical. The earthly part of them naturally fades away as their entire mind commits to pleasing God. This type of person is rare but not impossible to find.

In another passage, when talking about the small number of wise and just people, Philo says:

"Although such people are few and hard to find, they do exist. Both Greek and non-Greek lands bear witness to them. In Greece, for instance, there were the Seven Sages, who are famous for their wisdom. Although many others likely reached the same level of wisdom before and after them, the memory of the Seven Sages has endured through time, whereas the memory of more recent wise people has been forgotten due to the neglect of their contemporaries."In non-Greek lands, where the most respected and ancient traditions in words and deeds have thrived, there are many groups of honorable and virtuous people. For example, among the Persians, the Magi carefully study nature to gain knowledge of the truth in quiet silence and through clear mystical images. They are initiated into divine mysteries and then initiate others who come after them. 

In India, the Gymnosophists also study nature and focus on morals, making their entire lives a practical example of virtue. Palestine and Syria, where a significant portion of the Jewish population lives, are also rich in worth and virtue. Some Jews, known as Essenes, number over 4000 according to my estimate.

Philo then describes these famous mystics in detail. In Egypt, he highlights the many communities of the Therapeutae and Therapeutrides (translated in the Old Latin Version as Cultores et Cultrices pietatis), focusing on one particular group he was likely familiar with, which was mostly Jewish. Philo provides a vivid account of their settlement and lifestyle. Through this detailed description of the Contemplative or Theoretic Life, and the related passages from Philo's other works compiled by Conybeare in his "Testimonia," we are introduced to the environment and atmosphere of these Theoretics, setting the stage for the creation of our Trismegistic literature.Philo's ideas center on the belief that a truly philosophical life is an initiation into Divine Mysteries; to him, the entire tradition of Wisdom is inherently a mystery-tradition. He describes his own special Therapeut community, located south of Alexandria:

"In every cottage, there is a sacred chamber, called semneion and monasterion, where in solitude, they are initiated into the mysteries of the solemn life."

It is interesting to compare this with Matthew 6:6: "When you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you." It is said that among the "Pharisees," there was a prayer room in every house. We can also compare this reference to the Mysteries with Luke 12:2 and Matthew 10:26, from a source promising the revelation of all mysteries, similar to what is quoted in Mark 4:22 and Luke 8:17:

"For there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, and nothing hidden that will not be made known." "What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the rooftops." Both Evangelists have adapted their source material for their own purposes, but the core meaning of the original is not hard to recover. Additionally, it is interesting to compare the first part of these passages with a new saying:

"Jesus says, Everything that is not in front of you and everything hidden from you will be revealed to you. For there is nothing hidden that will not be made manifest, nor buried that will not be raised."Philo refers to other, broader mysteries. When discussing the command that a wicked person who speaks against divine matters should be removed from holy places and punished, our enlightened philosopher exclaims:

"Expel, expel, you who guard the secrets and you who reveal the divine mysteries, the unworthy and corrupt crowd—souls that cannot be purified, stubbornly resistant to cleansing. They have ears that won't close and tongues that won't stay inside their mouths—always ready to bring about their own downfall by hearing and speaking things they shouldn't."

Regarding these "ineffable mysteries," he also explains, using the wives of the patriarchs as symbolic representations of virtues:

"But to describe the conception and birth of virtues, let narrow-minded people either cover their ears or leave, because we offer a higher teaching of the divine mysteries to those who are worthy of the holiest rites. These are the ones who, without arrogance, practice true and sincere piety, free from any pretense. However, to those suffering from stubborn pride—those obsessed with words, names, and superficial manners, who measure purity and holiness by these standards—we will not act as spiritual guides."Regarding the mystery of the Virgin birth, which we will discuss later, Philo continues:

"Accept these truths into your hearts, you who are initiated and have purified ears, as truly sacred mysteries. Do not speak of them to those who are not initiated; instead, guard them within your hearts as a precious treasure. This treasure is not like a storehouse of perishable gold and silver, but the most valuable possession of all: the knowledge of the Cause of everything, Virtue, and their offspring."

Philo explains that the "Divine Spirit" (theion pneuma) does not remain with most people, although it may dwell with them briefly. "The Divine Spirit is always present with only one type of person—those who have stripped away all material concerns and come to God with minds that are free and open. For example, Moses set up his tent outside the camp (symbolizing the body), meaning he steadied his mind so it wouldn’t waver, and began to worship God. By entering the darkness, the unseen realm, he stayed there and was initiated into the most sacred mysteries. He became not only an initiate but also a revealer of divine truths and a teacher of spiritual matters, which he shared with those who had been purified.

With such people, the Divine Spirit is always present, guiding them correctly at every step."Philo discusses the ritual sacrifices of a heifer and two rams, explaining that the killing of the second ram and the sprinkling of the priests with its blood was meant for the highest level of purification through chastity. He calls this ram the "ram of perfection" because the priests were about to serve as leaders of sacred mysteries appropriate to God's servants and ministers.

Philo also describes the Therapeuts, who serve God not due to tradition or advice, but because they are driven by divine love, much like those initiated into the Bacchic or Corybantic Mysteries. They are fervent with love for God until they achieve their spiritual goals.

These Mysteries were meant to be kept secret, only revealed to the worthy. He advises:

"Just because you can speak, doesn't mean you should reveal everything, especially things that should remain unsaid."

In the final section of his treatise, Philo writes:

"I believe that those with proper instruction would rather be blind than see things they shouldn't, deaf than hear harmful words, and mute to avoid revealing sacred Mysteries. It's even better to make oneself a eunuch than to engage in unlawful relationships."

This can be compared to Matthew 5:29: "If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away"; and Matthew 19:12: "Some have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven; let anyone accept this who can."Both passages are found only in the first Gospel. Our mystic dualist says that to understand virtue, a person only needs reason, but to commit evil, a person requires the body's organs. "For how will he be able to reveal the Mysteries if he has no organ of speech?"

Philo's frequent mention of revealing the Mysteries indicates he considered it a grave offense. It almost seems like he was concerned about some group revealing parts of the mystery tradition to the uninitiated public. Elsewhere, he speaks of those who "draw near to God, leaving behind a life of death and sharing in immortality." He calls these people the "Naked" (meaning free from the flesh's burdens), who sacrifice everything to God. He adds that only these people "are allowed to see the ineffable Mysteries of God and are able to guard them" from the unworthy.

These Mysteries were divided into the Lesser and the Greater. In the Lesser Mysteries, the beginners "worked on their wild and savage passions, as if they were softening their food with reason (logos)." The way to prepare this divine food so that it becomes the bread of life was a mystery.

One doctrine revealed in the Lesser Mysteries was evidently the Trinity. Commenting on Genesis 18:2: "And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him," Philo writes:

"He lifted up his eyes," not the eyes of his body, because God cannot be seen by the senses, but by the soul alone. At the right time, He is discovered by the eyes of wisdom. The souls of the many and unrighteous are usually closed off since they lie dead in deep sleep and cannot wake up to the things of nature and the ideas within her.The wise man's spiritual eyes are always open and watchful, driven by a desire to see. It's said that he didn't just open one eye, but all the eyes within his soul, making it seem like he was entirely made of eyes. As he becomes the eye, he starts to see the holy and divine vision of the Lord in such a way that the single vision appears as a trinity, and the trinity as a unity.

Referring to the story of Abraham and Sarah, where Abraham asked Sarah to quickly prepare three measures of fine meal and make cakes, Philo explains the deeper meaning related to inner life:

"When God, along with His two highest Powers, Dominion and Goodness, stands in the middle, He creates a triple vision in the seeing soul. Each of these three goes beyond any measure; God surpasses all description, and so do His Powers, but He Himself measures everything.

"His Goodness measures things that are good, and His Dominion measures things that are subject to it, while He is the chief of all things, both physical and spiritual.

"Therefore, these Powers, receiving the Reason (Logos) of His rules, measure everything below them. Thus, these three measures should be mixed and blended within the soul, so that, understanding that He is the Highest God who transcends His Powers, both manifesting Himself without them and being seen in them, the soul may receive His impressions, powers, and blessings. By becoming initiated into the perfect secrets, the soul should not lightly reveal the divine Mysteries, but keep them guarded in secret."### Modern English Version

For it is written: "Keep them secret,"—the sacred teachings about the Ingenerable and His Potencies should be kept secret because not everyone can protect the sacred trust of the divine revelations.

#### Regarding the Sacred Marriage

The most important of all mysteries for Philo was the Sacred Marriage, the mystical union of the soul, represented as female, with God, represented as male. In this context, he refers to Genesis 4:1:

"Adam knew his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain. She said: I have gotten a man with the help of the Lord. And He also enabled her to give birth to Abel, his brother."

We are not concerned with the legitimacy or consistency of Philo's allegorical interpretation, where he used his national scriptures to support his chosen doctrines. However, we are very interested in these doctrines themselves, as they were favored by his circle and similar groups of mystics at the time. His views on the subject are clearly indicated, as he explains that he is speaking about a secret of initiation, not about the conception and birth of women, but about Virtues—that is, the virtuous soul. He continues in section 13:

"But it is not permissible for Virtues, in giving birth to their many perfections, to have part or share with a mortal husband. Yet they will never bring forth on their own without conceiving their offspring from another. Who, then, is He who sows in them their glorious progeny, if not the Father of all universal things—

the God beyond all creation, who is the Father of everything that exists? For God creates nothing for Himself, as He needs nothing; but for the person who prays for them, He creates all things."Philo uses the examples of Sarah, Leah, Rebecca, and Sepphora to illustrate the virtues connected with the great prophets of his lineage. He explains that Sarah conceived when God noticed her in deep contemplation, and thus she gave birth to Isaac for Abraham, who sought wisdom. Similarly, God "opened Leah's womb," akin to a husband's role, allowing her to bear children for Jacob, who endured great effort for the sake of beauty. Philo suggests that Virtue received divine influence and produced offspring for the most favored among her suitors.

Isaac, known for his wisdom, prayed to God, resulting in his virtue, Rebecca (symbolizing steadfastness), becoming pregnant. On the other hand, Moses, without any prayers, attained the elevated virtue Sepphora, who was already pregnant without a mortal father.

In section 14, referring to Jeremiah, Philo writes:

"Even though I was initiated into the Great Mysteries by Moses, God's friend, when I encountered Jeremiah, the prophet, and learned he was not just an initiate but also a master teacher, I eagerly became his disciple.

"And Jeremiah, inspired by God, delivered an oracle from God's presence, saying to the Virtue of Perfect Peace: 'Have you not called Me your Home, Father, and Husband of your virginity?' This clearly indicates that God is the Home, the immaterial realm of ideas, the Father of all creation, and the Husband of Wisdom, planting the seed of blessedness into pure, receptive soil for humanity."It is appropriate for God to interact with a pure and untouched nature, one that is truly a virgin, in a way different from ours. The union of men for the purpose of having children turns virgins into women. But when God begins to connect with the soul, He transforms a woman back into a virgin. He does this by removing the foreign, corrupt, and weak desires that made her womanly, and replacing them with noble, pure virtues.

However, even a virgin soul can be tainted by uncontrolled passions and thus be dishonored. Therefore, the oracle carefully states that God is not the husband of 'a virgin'—because a virgin is subject to change and death—but of 'virginity,' which is an unchanging and eternal idea. While qualities and characteristics are subject to birth and decay, the fundamental powers that shape them transcend dissolution.

Thus, it is only fitting that God, who is beyond all creation and change, should plant the seeds of immortal virgin virtues in us, rather than those of a woman who loses her virginity.

As Conybeare points out, Philo frequently uses terms like virgin, virginity, and ever-virginal. Philo was the first to articulate the idea that the Word or ideal organizing principle of the Cosmos is born from an ever-virgin soul, which conceives because God the Father plants His divine rays and seed into her, thus creating His beloved son, the Cosmos.Philo, when discussing the impure soul, writes:

"When the soul is full of passions and vices, its children—pleasures, appetites, folly, intemperance, unrighteousness, injustice—overwhelm it. The soul becomes weak, sick, and near death. However, when it stops producing these vices or even rejects them, it transforms into a pure virgin. By receiving the Divine Seed, it then creates virtues highly valued by nature—prudence, courage, temperance, justice, holiness, piety, and other good qualities."

Similarly, speaking of the Therapeutrides, he writes:

"They do not desire mortal children but seek an immortal progeny, which only a soul in love with God can produce. This happens when the Father sows spiritual light-beams into it, enabling it to understand the laws of wisdom."

Regarding the offspring of such pure souls, Philo elsewhere refers to the birth of "Isaac," which does not refer to any man but symbolizes Joy, the highest state of the soul—Laughter, the spiritually conceived Son of God, who brings comfort and happiness to souls at peace.

He adds later:

"And Wisdom, like a mother, brings forth the self-taught Race, declaring that God is its sower."

Again, speaking of this spiritual progeny, Philo writes:

"All Servants of God (Therapeuts), who are lawfully born, will fulfill their natural duty to become parents. Men will be fathers of many sons, and women will be mothers of numerous children."

In the case of Joseph's birth, when his mother Rachael says to Jacob: "Give me children!"The Deceiver, revealing his true nature, will say: "You have fallen into a grave mistake. I am not in God's position, who alone can open the souls' wombs, plant virtues in them, and make them fruitful and mothers of good things."

Similarly, regarding the birth of Isaac and Sarah's joyful exclamation: "The Lord has made me laugh; everyone who hears will rejoice with me," Philo exclaims:

"Listen carefully, initiates, and receive these sacred mysteries. 'Laughter' represents Joy, and 'has made' means 'has begotten,' implying: 'The Lord has fathered Isaac'—for He is the Father of perfect nature, planting and generating happiness in the soul."

This was evidently crucial for Philo, as seen in an intriguing autobiographical passage where he describes the joyous birth of Wisdom:

"She considers some worthy to live with her, while others seem too immature to handle such wise companionship. To the latter, she allows preliminary rites of marriage, promising future fulfillment. 'Sarah,' the Virtue governing my soul, has given birth, but not for me—because I was too immature to accept her offspring: wisdom, righteousness, and piety—due to the false beliefs I held. The constant care and anxiety for these false beliefs prevented me from nurturing the legitimate virtues, the true citizens of the soul."It is good, therefore, to pray for Virtue not only to bear children, as she naturally does without our praying, but also to bear sons for us, so that we may share in her blessings. For Virtue tends to offer her gifts to God alone, gratefully giving back the first fruits of what she has received to Him, who, as Moses says, "has opened her ever-virgin womb."

Philo constantly reiterates this profound teaching, which he considers the pinnacle of the holy life mysteries. He explains it further as follows:

We should understand that the True Reason (Logos) of nature acts as both a father and a husband for different purposes. As a husband, it sows the seeds of virtues into the soul, like planting them in a fertile field. As a father, it creates good advice and virtuous deeds and then nourishes them with the teachings of discipline and wisdom.

The intelligence is compared to different states: a virgin, a wife, or a widow, depending on its condition. It is like a virgin when it remains pure and untainted by pleasures, desires, griefs, and fears. In this state, the father who created it leads it. When intelligence lives as a virtuous wife with virtuous Reason (Logos), this same Reason cares for her, planting the best ideas in her like a husband.When the soul loses its children of prudence and its marriage with Right Reason, becoming widowed of her most valuable qualities and left desolate of Wisdom by choosing a blameworthy life, she must endure the suffering she has brought upon herself. Without wise Reason to heal her transgressions, neither as husband nor father, she faces her consequences alone.

In reference to Jacob's dream of the white, spotted, ring-straked, and speckled cattle, Philo explains that this should be seen as an allegory of souls. He says that the first type of souls are "white," meaning that when the soul receives the Divine Seed, its first offspring are pure white, like the purest light or the brightest radiance, akin to the sun's shadowless rays in a cloudless sky at noon.

This should be compared to the Vision of Hades seen by Thespesius (Aridaeus) and recounted by Plutarch. In the Unseen World, Thespesius’ guide points out the "colors" and "markings" of the souls:

"Notice the colors of the souls of every kind: that greasy, brown-grey indicates sordidness and selfishness; the blood-red, inflamed shade signifies a savage and venomous nature; blue-grey shows that incontinence in pleasure is hard to eradicate from such a nature; and innate malignity mixed with envy results in that livid discoloration, similar to how cuttlefish release their ink.

In earthly life, the vices of the soul, influenced by passions and reacting upon the body, create these discolorations. The aim of purification and correction here is to remove these blemishes, so the soul can become entirely radiant and uniformly colored."In explaining the allegorical meaning of the ancient story of Tamar, Philo not only interprets it through the concept of the Sacred Marriage but also incorporates elements from the Mysteries. He writes:

"As a widow, she was instructed to stay in the House of the Father, the Saviour. For his sake, she forever abandons mortal interactions and associations, becoming deprived and widowed from all human pleasures. She receives divine inspiration, becomes filled with the seeds of virtue, conceives, and gives birth to good deeds. When she brings them forth, she triumphs over her adversaries and is recognized as a victor, symbolized by the palm of victory."

Each stage of this divine conception reflects the great mystery of cosmic creation, which Philo summarizes as follows:

"It is correct to say that the Demiurge who created the universe is also its Father, while its Mother is the Wisdom of the Creator. God united with her, not as man with woman, and implanted the power of creation. She, receiving the seed of God, gave birth through perfect labor to His only beloved Son, whom all can perceive—this Cosmos."

CONCERNING THE LOGOS

Philo's idea of God represents the advanced theology of his time. God transcends all things and ideas. Although it would take too long to present all the numerous passages where Philo discusses his views on Deity, we will select just two to give readers unfamiliar with the famous Alexandrian's works an idea of the transcendence of his conception.As he writes:

"What a wonder it is that the true nature of existence is beyond human understanding, when even our own minds are beyond our comprehension. Who has ever truly understood the essence of the soul?"

The mystery of the Divine is inherently indescribable. However, it is understood in two ways: the active and the passive causative principles. "The Active Principle, the Mind of the universe, is completely pure and free from any mixture. It is beyond Virtue, Wisdom, and even beyond the Good and the Beautiful themselves. The Passive Principle, on its own, is lifeless and motionless, but when it is moved, shaped, and given life by the Mind, it becomes the most perfect of all creations—this Cosmos."

Commentators generally interpret the Passive Principle as Matter. If that is the case, it must be equated with Wisdom, which Philo considered the Mother of the Cosmos.

Philo is particularly valuable for documenting the views of contemporary Hellenistic theology on the concept of the Logos, the Mystery of the Heavenly Man, the Son of God. This mystical concept appears frequently in our Trismegistic literature, and it is also a dominant theme in many of Philo's writings. It's important to remember that Philo is not creating this doctrine but passing it on. His testimony is therefore extremely valuable for our study and deserves close attention. We will dedicate the rest of this chapter to this subject, presenting the evidence as closely to Philo's own words as possible. Although much has been written on the topic, we know of no work that simply lets Philo speak for himself.### The Son of God

The Logos, then, is primarily the Son of God. Philo writes:

"Moreover, God, as Shepherd and King, leads and rules with law and justice the nature of the heavens, the cycles of the sun and moon, and the orderly movements of other stars. He assigns this task to His own Reason (Logos), His Firstborn Son, to oversee the sacred flock, acting as the Great King's deputy."

Regarding this Heavenly Man, who Philo sees as the Celestial Messiah of God, he writes:

"I have heard one of Moses' companions say something like this: 'Behold the Man whose name is East'—a very strange name if you think it refers to a man made of body and soul. But if you understand it as referring to the Incorporeal Man, who is like the Divine Image, you will see that calling him East is appropriate.

"For the Father of all things made him rise as His Eldest Son, whom He also calls His Firstborn. When he was created, he imitated his Father's ways and, contemplating His archetypal patterns, shaped the forms of things."

Here, we notice Philo's vivid style of quoting Ezekiel as though he were still alive and speaking. We also see that the Firstborn Son is symbolically represented as the Sun rising in the East.

### The True High Priest

Furthermore, Philo explains in another passage, while discussing the true High Priest, that the Logos is the Son of God:

"But we say that the High Priest is not a man, but the Divine Reason (Logos), who is free from any transgressions, both voluntary and involuntary."Moses says that one cannot be defiled either by their father, which represents the Mind, or by their mother, which represents the higher Sense. This is because they are fortunate to have pure and incorruptible parents: God as the father, who is the Father of all things, and Wisdom as the mother, through whom all things are created. Additionally, 'his head has been anointed with oil' means that his ruling principle shines brightly, making him worthy of wearing his robes.

The Most Ancient Reason (Logos) of existence is clothed with the Cosmos as his garment. He wraps himself in Earth, Water, Air, and Fire, and everything that comes from them. The partial soul is clothed in a body, and the wise man's mind is clothed in virtues. 'He shall not take the mitre from his head' means he shall not remove the royal diadem, a symbol of his admirable rule, which is not that of an autocrat but of a viceroy. 'Nor will he rend his garments' means that the Reason (Logos) of existence holds all things together and does not allow them to be separated.

In another passage, Philo explains this concept more clearly from the perspective of the Mysteries:

"There are two temples of God: one is this Cosmos, where the High Priest is His First-born Divine Reason (Logos); the other is the rational soul, whose High Priest is the True Man. This True Man is the sensible copy of one who rightly performs the prayers and sacrifices of his Father. He is ordained to wear a robe that is a duplicate of the universal heaven, so that the cosmos may work together with man, and man with the universe."

The Cosmic Logos is not the physical cosmos but its Mind.Philo elaborates on this topic: "It is clear that the creator of all things must be absolutely wise. He is the father, creator, and ruler of everything in both heaven and the universe. Future events are hidden in the shadows of time, sometimes near and sometimes far. But God is also the creator of time. He is the father of time's father, which is the universe, as it reveals the motion that creates time. Thus, time is like the grandson of God.

"The universe is the younger son of God because it can be perceived by the senses. The older son is not perceivable by the senses but only by the mind. God has deemed the older son worthy of remaining with Him alone.

"This universe, the younger son, by its movement, has created the appearance and disappearance of time. Therefore, with God, nothing is in the future because He controls the very boundaries of time. God’s life is Eternity, where nothing is past or future, but everything is always present."

GOD IS ONE

The Logos, or Reason, is not God Himself but the Son of God and is sometimes called the "second God." Philo writes: "The most universal of all things is God, and second is the Reason (Logos) of God."

In his work titled "Questions and Answers," Philo explains, "Why does He speak of another God, saying 'in the image of God I made man,' rather than in His own image? This is a wise and excellent prophetic statement."It was not possible for anything mortal to be created in the image of the supreme God, the Father of the universes, but rather in the image of the second God, His Reason (Logos). It was necessary for the rational aspect of the human soul to be shaped by the Divine Reason (Logos), because God, who is beyond even His own Reason, transcends all rational beings. Therefore, nothing that can be created should be made to resemble Him who is beyond Reason and exists in the highest and most unique form.

From this, we understand that while Philo refers to the Logos as the "second God," he remains committed to his fundamental belief in one God. The Logos is not a separate entity from God but is the Reason of God. Despite this, Philo's term "second God" is often highlighted in discussions about his teachings on the Logos to emphasize the differences between his language and the introduction to the Fourth Gospel, often for argumentative purposes. However, Philo's commitment to monotheism is clear from another passage where he comments on Genesis 31:13: "I am the God who appeared to you in the place of God," which seems to refer to two Gods. He explains that the true God is one, and those referred to as gods are many, a misuse of the term. The true God is indicated by the article "the," saying "I am the God," while the one misnamed is referred to without the article, saying "who appeared to you in the place of God." Here, what Moses called "God" is actually His Most Ancient Word (Logos).

THE LOGOS IS LIFE AND LIGHT

Furthermore, this Logos is Life and Light.Philo writes about the concepts of "Spirit" and "Light" in a more understandable way:

"Moses referred to the Spirit as the Breath of God because it is the essence of life, and God is the source of all life. He called the Light the Light of God because it is the most beautiful thing in existence. The intelligible Light is far more glorious and brilliant than the visible light, much like the sun is to darkness, day is to night, and the mind, which guides the soul, surpasses the senses, and the eyes surpass the body.

Philo describes the Divine Reason (Logos) as the Image of God. This intelligible light is created as the image of the Divine Reason, which brings it into existence. This Light is the ultimate Star beyond all heavens, the Source of the stars we can see. It can be aptly called All-brilliancy, from which the sun, moon, and other stars draw their light, each according to its ability.

The idea of the Logos arises because humans cannot comprehend the absolute transcendence of God. Regarding theophanies (appearances of God) in human form, Philo writes:

"Just as people who cannot look directly at the sun see its reflected rays as the sun, and the light changes around the moon as the moon itself, so do people see the Image of God, His Angel, Reason (Logos), as God Himself."

The Divine Vision is the goal of a contemplative life, for:

"It is the special gift of those who dedicate themselves to the service of That-which-is..."To reach the heights of the heavens using their rational abilities, they should follow the example of Moses, who symbolizes the people devoted to God. By doing so, they will see the pure, clear place where the unchanging and steady God stands. Beneath His feet, it is like a sapphire stone, resembling the firmament of heaven, symbolizing the physical universe that Moses represents.

Those who pursue wisdom should desire to see God. If they cannot, they should at least aim to understand His most holy Image, the Logos (Reason), and the perfect work of the physical universe. Philosophy aims to clearly understand these things.

THE SONS OF GOD ON EARTH

Later in the same work (section 28), Philo writes further:

"But those who have attained wisdom are rightly called Sons of the One God, as Moses acknowledges when he says: 'You are the Sons of the Lord God,' and 'God who begat you,' and 'Is He not your father?'

If someone has not yet been fortunate enough to be called a Son of God, he should strive to align himself with God's First-born Reason (Logos), the eldest angel, who is also known as Dominion, Name of God, Reason, the Man-after-the-likeness, and Seeing Israel.

For this reason, I praised the principles of those who say: 'We are all Sons of One Man.' Even if we are not yet fit to be called Sons of God, we can at least be Sons of His Eternal Likeness, His Most Holy Reason. The Eldest Reason (Logos) is God's Image."Elsewhere, we also read:

"But the Reason (Logos) is God's Likeness, through which the entire Cosmos was created."

This Divine Reason is how the Cosmos came into existence. Philo writes:

"But if someone wants to use simple terms, he might say that the intelligible order of things is nothing but the Reason (Logos) of God continually creating the physical world-order.

"The City of God

"For the Intelligible City is simply the reasoning of the Architect deciding in His Mind to create a city perceptible by the senses, modeled after the City that only the mind can perceive. This is the doctrine of Moses, not just mine. When describing the creation of man, Moses explicitly states that man was made in the image of God. If this is true for the part—the image of the Image—it is clearly true for the whole Form, meaning the entire sensible cosmos, which is a greater imitation of the Divine Image than the human image is. 

"It is also evident that the Archetypal Seal, which we call the Cosmos and is only perceptible to the intellect, must itself be the Archetypal Pattern, the Idea of ideas, the Reason (Logos) of God."

Elsewhere, he writes:

"Looking at the grandest House or City, namely, this cosmos, you will find that its cause is God, who brought it into existence. Its matter is the four elements from which it is composed. The instrument used to build it is the Reason (Logos) of God. The purpose of its creation is the Goodness of the Creator."

And again:

"Now the Reason (Logos) is the Likeness of God, through which the entire cosmos was made."In simpler modern English, the text can be rewritten as follows:

"But God's Shadow is His Reason (Logos), which He used as a tool to create the universe. This Shadow is like the original model for everything else. Just as God is the original for His Image, which Moses now calls His Shadow, this Image is the model for everything else. Moses showed this when he said, 'And God made man according to the Image of God.' This likeness is modeled after God, and man is modeled after this likeness, which has the power of the Original."

Furthermore, the Divine Reason is seen as a tool for separation and division:

"So God, using His Reason (Logos) as a sharp tool, divided the formless and undifferentiated essence of everything. He separated the four elements of the universe from it, and from these elements, He made animals and plants."

We can compare this to a passage from The Acts of John, which discusses the Logos:

"But in truth, the Logos, as conceived and spoken of, is the marking-off and delimitation of all things, the firm necessity of those things that are fixed and were unsettled, and the Harmony of Wisdom."

Returning to the concept of the Logos as symbolized by the idea of a City, Philo allegorizes the six "cities of refuge" as follows:

"Isn't the most ancient, secure, and best Mother-city, and not just a city, the Divine Reason (Logos), which is the best place to seek refuge first? The other five cities are like colonies from it and represent the Powers of the Speaker of this Word (Logos), with the chief being the Creative Power, through which the Creator used Reason (or Word) to fashion the universe."The second is the Sovereign Power, through which the Creator governs what He has made. The third is the Merciful Power, through which the Creator shows compassion and mercy to His creation. The fourth is the Legislative Guidance, through which He forbids what should not be done.

Philo sees these "cities" as places where different types of erring souls can find refuge and comfort. If the Divine Reason, Creative Power, and Sovereign (Kingly) Power are too difficult for a sinner to understand, they should seek refuge in the closer "cities" of the Necessary Powers, specifically the Powers of Mercy and Law. The Law Power is twofold: commanding and forbidding, with the latter vaguely referred to as "averting evils" at the end of the chapter.

Additionally, Philo notes that the Scriptures contain symbols of these five Powers:

- The symbols of Command and Prohibition are the two tablets of the law in the ark.
- The symbol of the Merciful Power is the top of the ark, called the Mercy-seat.
- The symbols of the Creative and Sovereign Powers are the winged Cherubim set above the ark.
- The Divine Reason (Logos) did not take any visible form because it represents the very likeness of God, the oldest of all beings, and is understood only by the mind. It is closest to the One and Only Being, perfectly replicated without any gap.

For it is said: "I will speak to you from above the Mercy-seat, between the two Cherubim."

Thus, the one who drives the Chariot of the Powers is the Word (Logos), and the one who is carried in the Chariot is He who speaks the Word, guiding the Driver for the proper management of the universe.**The True Shepherd**

Philo describes God as the True Shepherd of the universe and everything within it, including the elements, the sun, moon, planets, stars, and heavens:

"He placed at the head His own True Reason (Logos), His First-born Son, who will take care of this sacred flock, acting as the deputy of the Great King."

The Divine Reason of things is seen as the Fullness of all powers, representing ideal space and time, if such terms can be used. The Logos is the proper Eternity. Philo mentions:

"The Divine Reason (Logos) whom God has completely filled with incorporeal powers."

**The Apostles of God**

This Supreme Logos is filled with powers—words (logoi), which are God's energies. Philo writes:

"For God, not hesitating to descend into the sensible world, sends forth His own 'words' (logoi) as His apostles to help those who love virtue; they act as healers, expelling the soul's diseases."

These "words" or "reasons" are like men's angels; they are the "light-sparks" or "rays" in the heart, often mentioned in "Gnostic" and similar literature—all coming from the Father-Sun, the Light of God, or Logos, which Philo calls "the Light of the invisible and supreme Deity that shines radiantly all around."

**The Ladder of the "Words"**

"When this Light shines into the mind, the secondary beams of the 'words' (logoi) are set [or hidden]."

When discussing the allegorical Ladder from earth to heaven, Philo first explains its cosmic correspondences and then applies the concept to the human world:

"The ladder (klimax), symbolically mentioned, is in the cosmos somewhat like what I have suggested."If we examine it in humans, we will find that it is the soul, with its earthly aspect being sensation and its heavenly aspect being the pure mind. Throughout the soul, "words" (logoi) move continuously; when they ascend, they elevate the soul, separating it from its mortal nature and revealing visions of things worth seeing. When they descend, they do not bring the soul down, for neither God nor God's Word (Logos) causes loss. Instead, they descend out of love and compassion for humanity, to help and support, breathing life into the soul, which is tossed by the body's challenges.

Only the God and Governor of the universe, beyond sound and sight, walks among the minds of those who have been thoroughly purified. For them, there is a prophecy that says: "I will walk among you; and I will be your God." 

But for those who are still being cleansed and have not yet purified their lives from bodily impurities, it is the angels and divine "words" (logoi) that enlighten them for the sake of Virtue.

This Light of God is the Divine Reason of things. As the Hymns sing, "For the Lord is my Light and my Savior," meaning He is not only Light but also the Archetype of all light. He is even more ancient and sublime than the Archetypal Model of all things, as the Model is His Word (Logos), the Light, while He Himself is unlike anything created.

THE LOGOS THE SPIRITUAL SUN

This Word, or Logos, is also symbolized in the natural world as the sun.The Spiritual Sun represents Divine Reason, described as the "intelligible model of the sun that moves in heaven." When God's Word (Logos) enters our earthly nature, it helps those who are virtuous and supportive of virtue, providing them with a perfect refuge and salvation, and bringing complete destruction to their enemies.

Therefore, the Logos is considered a cure for all troubles. The Word (Logos) is like a healing medicine for all the wounds and emotions of the soul. The lawgiver advises that we should restore this Word before the sun sets, meaning before the most brilliant rays of God, the supreme and most visible, disappear. These rays, out of God's compassion for humanity, are sent from Heaven into the human mind.

As long as this divine Light remains in the soul, we should return the Word (Logos) given to us as a pledge, like a garment. This garment serves to cover life's shame, allowing us to enjoy God's gift and find peace and quiet, thanks to the presence of such a guide and protector who never abandons his post.It seems that Philo is distinguishing between the Pure Light of the Logos and its reflection in human reason. He explains:

"We have extended this long discussion to show that the trained mind, driven by irregular movements to productivity and its opposite, and continually moving up and down the ladder—when it is productive and elevated, is bathed in the radiance of the archetypal, immaterial rays of the Divine Logic Source of God, who perfects all things. When it descends and is barren, it is illuminated by their images, the 'words' (logoi) immortal, which are commonly called angels."

THE DISCIPLES OF THE LOGOS

Philo then talks about those who are disciples of the Holy Word or Divine Reason. "These are truly men, lovers of temperance, orderliness, and modesty," whose lives he describes similarly to those of the Therapeuts. He concludes that such a life "is suited not for those who are merely called men but for those who truly are."

For those who consciously embark on the path of true manhood, there is a Way up to Deity itself. Philo writes:

"Stability, a sure foundation, and eternal constancy, unchanging and immovable, are first characteristics of That-which-is; second, of the Reason (Logos) of That-which-is, which He has called His Covenant; third, of the wise man; and fourth, of him who strives towards wisdom."

Philo then asks how the wicked mind can think it can stand alone "when it is swept here and there by the eddies of passion, which carry the body forth to burial like a corpse?"A bit later, he explains that Eden symbolizes the Wisdom of God.

"The Divine Reason (Logos) flows down like a river from Wisdom, its source, to nourish the heavenly virtues that grow on the sacred Mountain of the Gods, like a paradise. This Holy Reason splits into four streams, symbolizing four virtues, each reigning as a queen. This division is not about physical space but rather about ruling authority. By highlighting these virtues, Moses shows the wise person who uses these virtues as a true king, chosen not by human actions but by the Nature of Virtue, which is truly free and incorruptible.

"One of Moses' followers compares this Word (Logos) to a river in a hymn, saying, 'The river of God was filled with water.' 

"It is absurd to think that any earthly river could be called this; rather, it signifies the Divine Reason, full of Wisdom, completely pervasive and elevated throughout the universe by the eternal, continuous flow of its source.

"There is also a verse: 'The rapid flow of the river makes the city of God glad.'

"What kind of city? The current holy city, with its holy temple, is far from seas and rivers, indicating that the writer uses this imagery to convey a deeper meaning beyond the literal interpretation."The constant flow of Divine Reason (Logos) spreads joy throughout everything with speed and consistency. The cosmos is sometimes referred to as the City of God because it receives the full measure of Divine influence, becoming joyful and eternally joyous. 

In another sense, the soul of the wise person is considered a city where God walks, as it is written, "I will walk in you and I will be your God."

For the happy soul that extends its reasoning like a sacred vessel, who else but the Divine Reason (Logos), the master of the feast, pours out true joy? This joy is untainted delight, sweetness, good cheer, and the immortal essence of all joy and contentment, as poetry might say.

The Hebrews call the City of God Jerusalem, which means the 'Sight of Peace.' Do not look for this city in earthly places, for it is not made of physical materials, but seek it in the soul that lives in peace and contemplation.

This is how Philo understands the New Jerusalem (or Ogdoad), familiar from Gnostic writings, beyond which lies the Pleroma or Treasure of Light. He writes elsewhere that a fitting prayer, like that of Moses, is for God to reveal His Treasure, His sublime Reason (Logos), filled with divine lights, which Moses called Heaven.These "lights" are "reasons" (logoi), and further on he says:

"You see that the soul is not nourished by earthly and worthless things, but by the reasons that God bestows from His exalted and pure nature, which he ['Moses'] refers to as Heaven."

THE LOGOS IS LIKE MANNA AND CORIANDER SEED

A little further on, referring to the allegorical "manna" or heavenly food, "the bread which the Lord has given you to eat" (Ex. xvi. 13), he writes:

"Do you not see what the food of the soul is? It is the Eternal Reason (Logos) of God, like dew, surrounding the whole soul and ensuring that no part of it is devoid of the Logos. 

"But this Reason is not apparent everywhere, only in the person who is free from passions and vices; it is subtle for the mind to grasp, exceedingly clear and pure for sight to see. 

"It is, moreover, like a coriander seed. Farmers say that the seed of the coriander can be divided infinitely, and every single part, when planted, grows just like the whole seed. Such is the Reason (Logos) of God, beneficial in its entirety and in every part, however small it may be."

He adds further:

"This is the teaching of the hierophant and prophet, Moses, who says: 'This is the bread, the food which God has given to the soul,' that He has given us for nourishment, His own Word, His own Reason, for this Reason is the bread which He has given us to eat; this is the Word."

THE LOGOS IS THE PUPIL OF GOD'S EYE

Philo also compares the Divine Reason to the pupil of the eye—a concept that we will encounter later when discussing the meaning of the Kore Kosmoy ("Virgin of the World") treatise—for he writes:

"May not this Reason also be likened to the pupil of the eye?"Just as the smallest part of the eye, the pupil, can see everything—the vast sea, the endless sky, and the entire heavens from east to west—so too can Divine Reason see everything. It has the keenest vision and can perceive all things, allowing us to see beyond even the brightest light. Divine Reason is the brightest and most far-reaching, dispelling all mist and darkness and illuminating the soul.

"MAN SHALL NOT LIVE BY BREAD ALONE"

In another profoundly interesting passage, we read:

"For He nourishes us with His Reason (Logos), which is the most universal of all things. The Reason of God is above the entire cosmos; it is the oldest and most universal of all that exists. This Reason was unknown to the 'fathers'—not our true eternal fathers, but those ancient in time who said: 'Let us take a leader and return to' the passions of 'Egypt.'

"Therefore, let God announce His good news to the soul in this way: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God,' meaning he shall be nourished by the whole of Reason (Logos) and every part of it. 'Mouth' symbolizes the entire Logos, and 'word' is a part of it."

These "fathers" refer to those of our lower nature, not our true spiritual parents; these are the 'fathers' we must abandon. Compare this to Matthew 10:37: "He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me," and the more striking version in Luke 14:26: "If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, even his own soul, he cannot be My disciple."In the Gnostic gospel called the Pistis Sophia (341), the symbolic meaning of "parents" is explained in detail as representing the rulers of our lower nature. The Master says: "This is why I previously told you, 'Anyone who does not leave father and mother to follow Me is not worthy of Me.' What I meant was, 'You must leave behind these rulers to become children of the First Everlasting Mystery.'" 

The most notable point is that in Matthew 4:4, the story of the Temptation quotes the exact same words from the LXX text of Deuteronomy 8:3 as Philo does, starting and ending in the same place, both omitting the final redundant phrase "shall man live"—a very curious coincidence. Luke 4:4 only preserves the first half of the sentence, but it clearly existed in the same form that Philo used before the first and third Evangelists in their second or "Logia" source. This suggests it was a commonly quoted text.

THE LOGOS-MEDIATOR

The Divine Reason is depicted as a true "Person," acting as the Mediator between God and man. Philo writes:

"And to His angel-ruling and most ancient Reason (Logos), the Father who created everything has given a special gift—that standing as a Boundary between them, he may distinguish creature from Creator. The Reason himself always intercedes with the Incorruptible on behalf of mortal kind in its distress and is the King's ambassador to the natural world."He takes pride in his gift and insists on its importance, saying: "Yes, I have stood between the Lord and you—not as uncreated like God, nor as created like you, but in between the two extremes, a mediator for both: to God, as a promise that the creation will never fully turn away from Him or rebel, choosing chaos over order; and to the creation, giving hope that God, the Merciful, will never abandon His own work. For I will bring the news of peace to the creation from the One who knows how to end wars, from God, the Everlasting Peacekeeper."

In discussing the symbolic nature of the High Priest's sacred garments, Philo explains that the twelve stones on the High Priest’s breastplate, arranged in four rows of three, symbolize the Divine Reason (Logos), which holds and governs the universe. This breastplate is thus the sacred oracle of God. "It was necessary for the one dedicated to the Father of the universe to have His Son, the most virtuous, as an intercessor, for both the forgiveness of sins and for the abundant supply of blessings. It also teaches the Servant of God that even if he cannot be worthy of the Creator, he should still strive to be worthy of the creation; for once he has been clothed with its likeness, he must carry the image of the model in his mind, transforming himself to reflect the nature of the universe, and, if we are to speak truthfully—yes, we should speak truthfully!—he should become a little universe himself."**The Yoga of Plotinus**

With these helpful insights, we can compare the fascinating passage from Plotinus in his essay "On Intelligible Beauty," where he outlines his yoga system. This passage is likely the most important one we have from the leading figure of Later Platonism, as it probably describes the method the school used to achieve ecstasy. 

"Let's imagine the cosmos with all its parts staying as they are, but interpenetrating each other, visualizing them together as one as much as possible. So, when we first think of the 'one' (such as the outer sphere), we immediately also see the sun, the other stars, the earth, the sea, and all living things, as if they were all in one transparent sphere—as if everything could be seen within it.

"Then, let there be in the soul an image of a sphere of transparent light containing all things, whether moving or still, or some moving and others still.

"And, holding this sphere in mind, imagine another sphere, removing from it any idea of mass, space, and matter. Do not try to imagine just a smaller sphere than the first one.

"Then, invoking God who made the true sphere you hold a phantom of in your mind, pray that He may come.

"And may He come with His own cosmos, with all the Gods within it—He being one and all, and each God being all, united into one, yet different in their powers, and yet, in that multitude, all one."The One God encompasses all the gods because He is complete in Himself, even though the gods originate from Him. They are all united yet distinct in a non-physical state, without any form that can be sensed.

Otherwise, each god would be in a different place, separate from each other, and not unified within themselves. Each whole is not a divided power measured by parts; instead, this whole represents all power, infinite and immensely powerful. The divine order is so vast that even its parts are infinite.

THE RACE OF GOD

Returning to Philo, the rational soul or mind of man has the potential to be the Intelligible Cosmos or Logos. Thus, he writes:

"Moses did not name the species of the rational soul after any created thing but called it the image of the Divine and Invisible, believing it to be a true image created and impressed with the soul of God, of which the Signet is the Eternal Reason (Logos)."

A disciplined soul will realize this within himself. Abraham is an example of such a man because:

"Leaving behind mortal things, he joins the people of God, achieving immortality and becoming equal to the angels. For the angels are the host of God, incorporeal and happy souls."

The angels are the "people" of God, but there is an even higher level of union where a man becomes one of the "Race" or "Kin" of God. This "Race" is an intimate union of all those who are "kin to Him," making them one. This Race is singular and the highest, whereas "people" refers to many. Those who have advanced in discipline and instruction and have been perfected belong to this "many."Those who have advanced beyond the basic teachings, becoming true followers of God and gaining wisdom effortlessly, transition to an immortal and perfect existence, better than their previous lives.

The immortality of the mind can be illustrated by the death of Moses. According to Philo, Moses transitioned through the "Word (Logos) of the Cause," by which the entire universe was created. This demonstrates that God values a wise person as much as the universe itself, using the same Reason (Logos) to create the cosmos and to bring a perfect person back to Himself.

That's enough about Philo for now. This brief introduction allows readers to hear Philo's perspective on the key idea of his universe. There's much more to say—entire volumes could be written—because it offers one of the most crucial contexts for understanding Christian origins. Without a deep understanding of Hellenistic theology, it's impossible to properly grasp many concepts.

Footnotes:

1. Over sixty of Philo's writings are preserved, along with numerous fragments from lost works.
2. Philo is known to the Jews as Yedidyah ha-Alakhsanderi.
3. In D.V.C., section 3; M. ii. 475, P. 893 (Ri. v. 309, C. 65), Philo mentions the ancient authors who led his school and left many allegorical works. Allegorizing was common, not just among Jews but also in interpreting Homer and in Stoic philosophy. This "treatment of myths" was the only way to connect contemporary philosophy and science with popular beliefs.The text I use is from Richter's "Philonis Judaei Opera Omnia" in Bibliotheca Sacra Patrum Ecclesiae Graecorum (Leipzig, 1828-1830), 8 volumes. "M." refers to Mangey's edition, "P." to the Paris edition, and "Ri." to Richter's edition, to avoid confusion with "R." which stands for Reitzenstein. "C." refers to Conybeare's critical text of the D. V. C. (Oxford, 1895), the only truly critical text we have so far.

For more information on Philo, see "Philo" in Smith and Wace's Dictionary of Christian Biography (London, 1887), vol. 4, pp. 357-389, which is the best general study in English. Drummond's two volumes, "Philo Judaeus, or The Alexandrian Philosophy" (London, 1888), are also worth consulting but have some shortcomings. The only English translation is Yonge's "The Works of Philo Judaeus" (London, 1854) in Bohn's Library, but it is unsatisfactory, so I have made my own translations for all quotations.

For an ancient Alexandria overview, see F. F. F., pp. 96-120. For a translation of the famous tractate from Conybeare's recent critical text, see F. F. F., pp. 66-82. (D. V. C., section 3; M. ii. 474, P. 891; Ri. v. 308, C. 56).

There is unfortunately a gap in the text, so the characteristics of the fifth potency are not detailed; however, it is explained elsewhere that the Legislative Providence is a dual potency, namely, the Enjoining and the Forbidding. ^238:1 Exodus 25:22. ^238:2 This clearly refers to the Merkabah or Chariot of Ezekiel's Vision. ^238:3 De Profugis, section 19; M. i. 561, P. 465 (Ri. iii. 131). ^238:4 De Agricultura, section 12; M. i. 308, P. 195 (Ri. ii. 116). ^239:1 De Somniis, i. section 11; M. i. 630, P. 574 (Ri. iii. 227). ^239:2 Ibid., section 12; M. i. 631, P. 575 (Ri. iii. 229). ^239:3 Ibid., section 13. ^240:1 Meaning the souls. ^240:2 Leviticus 26:12. ^240:3 De Somniis, section 23; M. i. 642, 643, P. 587 (Ri. iii. 245, 246). ^241:1 Psalm 27:1. A.V. "salvation." LXX."Futismos," meaning "illumination," was a technical term among the mystics of Early Christianity for baptism, instead of the "fus" of Philo. This refers to the Logos as Pleroma. (De Som., section 13). This pertains to the vices of the soul (Ibid., section 15; M. i. 363, P. 578 (Ri. iii. 232)). This seems to recall the custom of evening prayer in the Therapeut and similar communities, where, at sunset, it was instructed to give rational praises to God for received benefits. However, Philo is here commenting in an allegorical manner on the pawnbroking law in Exodus 22:26-27: "If you take your neighbor's garment as a pledge, you must return it by sunset, because it is his only covering. In what else will he sleep? If he cries out to me, I will listen, for I am compassionate." (See section 16). The Authorized Version (A.V.) translates differently. 

Compare the well-known saying from the Gospel according to the Egyptians, "Unless you tread on the garment of shame." (De Som., section 18; M. i. 637, P. 582 (Ri. iii. 238)). 

Or "Rational." (Ibid., section 19; M. i. 638, P. 582 (Ri. iii. 239)). (Ibid., section 20; M. i. 639, P. 584 (Ri. iii. 241)). Compare C. H., x. (xi.) 24. (De Som., ii. section 36; M. i. 690, P. 1140 (Ri. iii. 312)). 

Literally, "Olympian." The term "arxai" means both "sources" and "principles" or "sovereignties," but the wordplay is difficult to maintain in English. 

Or "kingdom," specifically "of the heavens," or rulership of the celestial realms, or rather of oneself. (Psalm 65:9). The Septuagint (LXX) translates it as: "You greatly enrich it with the river of God, which is full of water." (Psalm 46:4). The LXX uses the plural "rivers" or "streams." The A.V. translates: "There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God."^245:2 The physical city of Jerusalem in Palestine.

**Introduction**

In the chapter about Philo, we explored the core doctrine of Hellenistic theology—the profound concept of the Logos—as understood by a learned Jew from the Diaspora who was deeply influenced by Hellenism and lived in Egypt's capital, a hub of intellectual life in Greater Greece. In this chapter, we aim to provide further insight into this key idea from a different perspective by presenting the views of a learned Greek. This Greek scholar, while rooted in Hellenic traditions, turns his attention to Egypt and interprets its mysterious messages through Greek thought.

Plutarch, from Chaeroneia in Boeotia, thrived in the second half of the first century A.D., following closely after Philo and Paul. Like Philo, he was unaware of Christians, yet he focused on issues that were, and still are, of great interest to Christians. Plutarch's chosen theme is the myth and mysteries of Osiris and Isis.He outlines the myth and introduces us to the general religious atmosphere of Egyptian beliefs during what we might call "Demotic" times. But he does much more than that. As someone initiated into the Osiris mysteries, which seemingly had a group at Delphi, he knows more details than he can reveal. He understands that a true initiate of Isis goes beyond just learning the symbolic mysteries; they must continually seek and explore the deeper meanings behind the sacred rites.

Plutarch is well-suited for this task, not only because of his extensive knowledge of the philosophy, theology, and science of his time but also because he held a high position at Delphi, serving Apollo and participating in the Dionysiac rites. He was likely a significant religious leader, not just in title but in practice.

Plutarch provides a highly informative explanation that helps us, if we put ourselves in his shoes and think like people of his era, to understand the ancient struggle between physical reason and formal theology. This conflict was intense back then and has been renewed on a much larger scale over the past few centuries, continuing to this day.Our philosopher does not align himself with atheism, pure physicalism, or superstition, as understood in his time. He adopts a middle ground and seeks solace in the concept of the Logos, doing so with humility, knowing that whatever he can express is merely a faint reflection of the divine glory. He explicitly states:

"Human souls on earth, confined within bodies and passions, can only glimpse a shadowy dream of God through a mind trained in philosophy" (lxxiii. 2).

Plutarch examines various theories of his time that aimed to explain ancient mythological and theological mysteries, particularly focusing on the Osiris myth. He reviews Evemerus's theory that gods were simply ancient kings and notable figures but dismisses it as unsatisfactory (xxiii.). He then considers the idea that these myths relate to the actions of daimones, finding it an improvement over Evemerus's theory (xxv.). 

Next, he explores the theories of the Physicists or natural phenomenalists (xxxii.) and the Mathematici, referring to Pythagorean ideas about the celestial spheres and their harmonies (xli.). He believes there is some truth in each of these theories but finds each one alone insufficient; they must be combined (xlv.), and even then, it is not enough. 

He then delves into the question of first principles, discussing the theories of the One, the Two, and the Many, acknowledging value in each but not fully embracing any as completely adequate. Of all the interpretations, he finds the least satisfactory to be those that reduce the mystery-myths to simple agricultural activities like plowing and sowing.With his "vegetation god" theory, he has little patience and criticizes its proponents as a "dull crowd." Here, some of us might think that Plutarch's ideas are still relevant even in the twentieth century, and his arguments could be useful for anthropologists who are currently enthusiastically supporting what Andrew Lang humorously calls the "Covent Garden" theory.

Further on, when discussing the complex issue of Egyptian "animal worship," Plutarch encounters many problems related to "taboo" and "totemism." What he says about these topics remains interesting, as do his theories on utilitarianism and symbolism. Finally, he shares his perspective on the custom of burning incense, which might be relevant to many in modern Christian communities.

Plutarch believes that the entire set of customs and rites, no matter how puzzling or contradictory they seem, and all the mysteries of Egyptian priestly traditions can be understood clearly by properly understanding human nature and its relationship to Divine Nature, which he sees as the eternal partner of Divine Reason, the Logos.

Although it might have been simpler and shorter for some readers if I had summarized Plutarch's ideas, my goal is to let this scholar of comparative theology speak for himself, rather than present my own interpretations. Despite the advanced formal education of the twentieth century, I still believe that we cannot know more about the ancient mysteries and their true meaning than the best minds who were initiated into them while they were still practiced.We lack the precise data that the ancients had, and our current way of thinking doesn't tolerate the considerations that I believe best explain the essence of the ancient mystery traditions. I've decided to provide a full version of Plutarch's treatise from a reliable critical text because the only English translation I've read is not carefully done and is based on a flawed text. Plutarch's language in some passages deserves more careful handling, as some sentences seem deliberately phrased to convey double meanings. 

Regarding Plutarch's interpretation, he, being Greek, focused more on intellectual modes of thought than an Egyptian priest might have. The Egyptians probably valued the experience of direct contact with the Mystery through the body rather than the mind. In other words, they sought union by becoming a vessel for the Great Breath in their bodies rather than a mirror of the Mystery in their minds.

It's also interesting that Plutarch addresses his treatise to a woman. While there are moral writings addressed to wives, like Porphyry's Letter to Marcella and Plutarch's Consolation to his wife Timoxena, it's rare to find philosophical treatises addressed to women. Nowadays, many women are again interested in such philosophy. Plutarch wrote his essay at Delphi.The treatise was written for Klea, a prominent Delphic priestess who had been initiated into the Osiriac Mysteries—her name Klea might even be her mystery name. Consequently, the treatise assumes that its reader will understand deeper meanings beyond the surface. It is likely that Plutarch's main source of information was the now-lost work on Egyptian Religion by Manetho. It is interesting to note Granger's opinion on Plutarch's "De Iside et Osiride," stating:

"First, Plutarch addresses the views that equate the Egyptian gods with natural elements, such as Osiris with the Nile and Isis with the land. Then, he discusses interpretations that link the gods with celestial bodies like the sun and moon. These ideas reflect, directly or indirectly, some of the Hermetic texts available during Plutarch's time."

CONCERNING ISIS AND OSIRIS

ADDRESS TO KLEA CONCERNING GNOSIS AND THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH

I. 1.While everyone with a mind, O Klea, should seek blessings from the Gods, let us, by seeking them, pray to gain knowledge about them, as much as humanly possible. There is nothing greater for a person to obtain or more majestic for a God to give than Truth.

2. The Gods provide people with what they need, but they share mind and wisdom with them, since the Gods themselves possess and use these qualities. The Divine is not blessed or powerful through wealth or thunder, but through knowledge and wisdom.

3. Homer beautifully expressed the idea that both Gods and humans have a common origin, but Zeus came first and knew more, highlighting Zeus's primacy in knowledge and wisdom.

4. I believe that the good fortune of eternal life, which the God possesses, ensures that things in existence do not completely perish. Without knowledge and wisdom, freedom from death is merely Time—not Life.Therefore, the longing for a divine state is a desire for Truth, particularly the truth about the Gods, as it involves receiving sacred knowledge through instruction and research. This pursuit is more sacred than any purification rite or temple service and is especially pleasing to the Goddess you serve, as she values wisdom. Her name, "Isis," suggests that knowledge and understanding are more fitting for her than any other title.

"Isis" is Greek, as is "Typhon," who opposes the Goddess and is "puffed up" with ignorance and deceit. He tears Holy Reason (Logos) to pieces, which the Goddess then gathers, recomposes, and shares with those who have perfected the art of divinisation. These individuals lead a sober life, abstain from many foods and sexual indulgences, and temper their desires. This discipline prepares them for the rigorous tasks of sacred rites, ultimately leading to the knowledge of the First and Supreme One, who can only be known by the mind. The Goddess encourages them to seek Him, even though He is always by her side and one with her.

Moreover, the name of the holy place promises knowledge of That-which-is, as it is called Iseion, meaning "of those who shall know" That-which-is. This knowledge is attainable if we enter the holy places of the Goddess with reason and purity.### The True Initiates of Isis

#### III.

1. Many people have claimed that Isis is the daughter of Hermes, while others believe she is the daughter of Prometheus. I support the latter view, considering Prometheus as the discoverer of wisdom and foresight, and Hermes as the master of writing and the arts of the Muses.

2. Therefore, in the city dedicated to Hermes, they call the foremost of the Muses Isis. They also associate her with Righteousness because she is wise, as previously mentioned, and reveals the mysteries of the Gods to those who truthfully and justly carry the sacred symbols and wear the holy robes.And these are the ones who carry the sacred knowledge about the Gods, free from superstition and unnecessary details, in their minds, as if in a chest, and cover it with robes—revealing, in secret, the dark and unclear as well as the clear and bright truths about the Gods, as suggested by the sacred dress. 

Therefore, when the followers of Isis at their "death" are dressed in these robes, it symbolizes that this sacred knowledge is with them; and with it alone they go there.

For it is not growing a beard and wearing a cloak that makes someone a philosopher, Klea, nor wearing linen and shaving oneself that makes someone an initiate of Isis. A true follower of Isis is one who, when they receive the teachings by law, seeks to understand the mysteries shown and performed concerning these Gods, and reflects on their true meaning.### Why the Priests are Shaven and Wear Linen

1. Most people don't understand why priests shave their heads and wear linen robes. Some don't care to know, while others think priests avoid wool and meat from sheep because they consider them sacred. They believe priests shave their heads as a sign of mourning and wear linen because its color resembles the ethereal light surrounding the cosmos.

2. However, the true reason, as Plato says, is: "It is not lawful for the pure to touch the impure." 

Excess nourishment and waste are neither chaste nor pure, and it is from these excesses that wool, fur, hair, and nails grow. 

3. It would be absurd for priests to shave their own hair for purification and then wear the hair of animals.

4. Hesiod suggests that people should only keep holy days when they are free from such impurities and not need purification during sacred practices.The flax grows from the everlasting earth, producing food for humans and providing a light, pure fabric that is comfortable to wear at all times. It is known for being the least hairy material, among other qualities that can be further explained.

Footnotes:

1. "xroan" can also mean surface, skin, or tone in melody.
2. Reference to Phaedrus, 67 B.
3. "perissuma" likely refers to something surrounding the body, such as hair.
4. "thremmatun" literally means "things nourished," hinting at nourishment mentioned earlier.
5. Hesiod's "Works and Days," lines 741 and following, preserves this piece of ancient wisdom, possibly from Orphic fragments in Boeotia. This wisdom reflects an older Greek tradition, later revived by the Later Platonic School in connection with ancient Chaldean fire mysteries. "Five-branched" might symbolize a purified man and refer to the pruning of this metaphorical tree. This predates Pythagorean symbols by 300 years. Additionally, consider the saying attributed to the Master during the Crucifixion (Luke 23:31): "For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?"—likely an old gnomic or mystery saying. "Moist nature" represents the feminine aspect of the fiery or dry.### On Avoiding Meat, Salt, and Excesses

1. The priests are very strict about avoiding excesses. They not only discourage eating various kinds of beans and meats such as sheep and pork, which they believe cause excess, but also avoid adding salt to grains during purification rituals. This is partly because salt makes people thirstier and hungrier, increasing their cravings.

2. The idea that salt is impure because many tiny organisms die in it when it solidifies, as suggested by Aristagoras, is considered naive.

3. It's also mentioned that they give the Apis bull water from a special well, avoiding Nile water. This isn't because they think Nile water is contaminated by crocodile blood, as some believe (since Egyptians highly value the Nile), but because drinking too much Nile water can cause excessive weight gain.

4. Therefore, they don't want the Apis bull or themselves to become overweight. They aim to keep their bodies lean and light so that their souls are not burdened by the physical body, allowing the divine aspect to prevail.

1. Originally translated as "endure with such difficulty" or "feel such disgust at."ON THE DRINKING OF WINE

1. In Sun City, the servants of the God do not bring wine into the sacred place because it is not proper for them to drink during the day while their Lord and King is watching.

2. Others do drink wine, but only in moderation. They often abstain from wine during certain periods, dedicating that time to seeking wisdom and learning and teaching about the Gods.

3. The kings did drink wine, but only in specific amounts as prescribed by sacred texts, as Hecataeus recorded, since they were also priests.

4. However, they only started drinking wine from the time of Psammetichus; before that, they did not drink wine at all.They did not use it as an offering to the gods because it was considered the blood of those who fought against the gods. They believed that when these beings fell and mixed with the earth, vines grew from their blood. This, they thought, is why drinking wine makes people lose their minds, as they are filled with the blood of those ancient beings.

Eudoxus mentions these beliefs in Book II of his Circuit, according to what the priests have said.

---

ON FISH TABOOS

1. Regarding sea fish, Egyptians generally avoid some types rather than all. For instance, people from the Oxyrhynchus region avoid fish caught with a hook because they revere the sharp-snouted fish and believe the hook is impure when it catches this fish. Meanwhile, people from the Syene region avoid the "devourer" fish, as it appears with the rising of the Nile and is seen as a messenger indicating the river's growth.Their priests, on the other hand, abstain from all; and even on the ninth of the first month, when every other Egyptian eats grilled fish in front of their houses, the priests do not taste it. Instead, they burn their fish to ashes in front of the Temple doors.

They have two reasons for this, one of which I will discuss later concerning the religious beliefs about Osiris and Typhon. The obvious reason is that fish is seen as an unnecessary and excessive food. This is supported by Homer, who mentions that neither the luxurious Phaeacians nor the people of Ithaca, nor even Odysseus's companions on their long sea voyage, ate fish before reaching the final strait.

In general, the priests believe that the sea originates from fire and lies beyond the boundaries of the earth, neither part of it nor an element of it, but something superfluous and corrupting.**THE ONION AND PIG TABOOS**

1. Contrary to what some believe, the foundational sacred practices are not based on irrational, fictional, or superstitious reasons. Some practices have moral and essential causes, while others are connected to scientific and physical principles, such as the case with the onion.

2. The story that Diktys, the child cared for by Isis, drowned while trying to catch onions in the river, is completely unbelievable.

3. Priests avoid onions and are wary of them because onions thrive and grow well when the moon is waning. Onions are unsuitable for both fasting and feasting—during fasting, they make people thirsty, and during feasting, they cause tears.

4. Similarly, the sow is considered an unholy animal because it tends to breed when the moon is waning, and drinking its milk causes leprosy and rough skin conditions.

5. The story that Typhon, while chasing a pig during the full moon, found the wooden coffin containing Osiris's dead body and scattered it, leading to the practice of sacrificing and eating pig only once at the full moon, is not universally accepted. Some see it as a misunderstanding of the true story.

6.But they say that their ancestors protected themselves against a life of luxury and indulgence. They claim that at Thebes, a slab was placed in a sacred site with inscriptions condemning Meinis, the king who first led the Egyptians away from a simple and modest lifestyle. 

Moreover, it is said that Technactis, the father of Bocchoris, while on a campaign against the Arabs, found joy in eating simple food when his supplies were delayed. He later fell into a deep sleep on a bed of straw and thus embraced a life of frugality. Consequently, he cursed Meinis and, with the approval of the priests, had his curse inscribed on stone. 

Footnotes:

1. Diktys, also known as the Netter, was sometimes referred to as the Fisher and was considered a son of Poseidon in other myths.
2. Reference to previous sections.
3. "Epidrassomenon" suggests that the Fisher-soul might have fallen from the celestial boat of Isis. This myth might not be as implausible as Plutarch suggests. Regular onions do not grow in rivers.
4. "Prosforon" could also mean "fit."
5. Wordplay on "food" with the term "tous prosferomenoys."
6. "Exanthei" literally means "flower."
7. "Lepran" refers to something that makes the skin scaly and rough, indicating a deeper mystical meaning.
8. This seems to occur once a year.
9. Reference to a previous section.
10. This raises the possibility of similar misunderstandings in the myth as recorded by Plutarch.
11. Likely referring to Mneuis (Mnevis), the sacred black bull symbolizing the spirit of Ra, with potential mystical significance.**The Kings, The Riddles of the Priests, and the Meaning of Amoun**

1. The kings were chosen from either the priests or the warriors. The warriors were valued for their bravery, and the priests for their wisdom.

2. When a warrior became king, he also became a priest and learned their philosophy. This philosophy was often hidden in myths and stories, which hinted at deeper truths. The priests symbolized this hidden wisdom by placing sphinxes in front of temples, suggesting that their teachings about the gods were mysterious and complex.

3. There was an inscription on Athena's (or Isis's) seat at Sais that read:

"I am all that has been, is, and will be, and no mortal has ever unveiled my robe."

4. Many believe that the Egyptians' name for Zeus is Amoun, which we call Ammon. Manetho, a Sebennyte priest, thinks this name means "hidden" and that this hidden nature is evident in the way the name sounds.Hecataeus of Abdera says that the Egyptians use the word "Amoun" when calling to each other, as its sound has the power of "calling to."

When they call to the First God, who they believe is universal, they invoke Him as the Unmanifest and Hidden by saying "Amoun!" This shows the great care Egyptians took in the wisdom related to the divine mysteries.

Some of the wisest Greeks, such as Solon, Thales, Plato, Eudoxus, Pythagoras, and possibly Lycurgus, are said to have visited Egypt and learned from its priests. Eudoxus learned from Chonouphis of Memphis, Solon from Sonchis of Sais, and Pythagoras from Oenuphis of Heliopolis. Pythagoras, in particular, absorbed and reflected on these teachings, bringing back symbolic and mysterious knowledge to his followers.Most of the Pythagorean teachings don't omit what are known as hieroglyphic symbols. For example: "Don't eat what has two," "Don't sit on a measure," "Don't plant a phoenix," and "Don't stir a fire with a knife at home."

I believe that calling the number one "Apollo," the number two "Artemis," the number seven "Athena," and the first cube "Poseidon" is similar to how statues of gods are placed in sacred sites and their stories are performed and painted there.

They write the name of the King and Lord, Osiris, with an "eye" and a "scepter." Some say the name "Osiris" means "many-eyed" in Egyptian, with "os" meaning "many" and "iri" meaning "eye."

They depict Heaven as eternal with a "heart" symbolizing spirit, rising from an "altar" beneath it. In Thebes, statues of judges were made without hands, and the chief judge's statue had its eyes closed to show that Justice is impartial and incorruptible.

Warriors used the "scarab" as their emblem because scarabs are all male and create spheres for their offspring, symbolizing creation and genesis.^275:2 "epi difron" means "off a chair" or "in a chariot," implying "on a journey." It could symbolize something carrying or bringing forth two things, perhaps warning against duality and urging contemplation of unity.

^275:3 The "xoinix" was a unit of dry measure, typically a slave's daily ration of grain. It could symbolize not being content with mere "daily bread." Instead, it suggests striving beyond measured limits, embracing the immeasurable.

^275:4 "foinix" means a "Phoenician," a "date palm," or a "phoenix"; its color was "purple red," "purple," or "crimson." The phoenix, in particular, rose from its ashes and was golden. "fytuein" means "to plant" or "to engender."

^275:5 "maxaira" was the term for a sacred sacrificial knife in Homeric times, used to kill and divide the victim while the fire consumed it. This symbol might relate to Hesiod's couplet (iv. 3), often interpreted as "Do not provoke an angry man," but it also includes the phrase "in house," suggesting a deeper context.

^275:6 Compare with lxxv. 14.

^275:7 Likely referring to the ogdoad or a group of eight.

^275:8 Could mean "written" or "engraved."

^276:1 For example, Asar (Osiris).

^276:2 Usually a "throne" in hieroglyphs. For many variations, see Budge's "Gods of the Egyptians," vol. ii, p. 113. Compare with li. 1 below.

^276:3 "aidioteta" means formlessness or transcending all forms.

^276:4 "thymon" is a primitive Greek term for spirit, soul, or life principle.

^276:5 "esxara" refers to an altar for burnt offerings, likely symbolizing Earth as the counterpart of Heaven.Remember that the "mark" of the warriors was their courage and manliness. Matter, being like a nurse, is described by Plato. The legend was that the scarab beetle laid its eggs in dung, which it first shaped into balls.

ADVICE TO KLEA CONCERNING THE HIDDEN MEANING OF THE MYTHS

1. When you hear the Egyptian myths about the Gods—such as their wanderings and dismemberments—you should remember what has been said before. These stories are not to be taken literally. 

2. The Egyptians do not literally call Hermes a "Dog." Instead, they associate the characteristics of a dog—its alertness and ability to distinguish between friend and foe—with Hermes, who is the most Logos-like of the Gods, as Plato says.

3. They do not believe the sun is literally born as a baby from a lotus. Rather, this is a metaphor for the sun rising, symbolizing its rekindling from moist elements.

4. They called the brutal Persian King Ochus, who killed many and even slaughtered the sacred bull Apis, "Knife." This nickname is not a literal description of his essence but a metaphor for his cruel nature, likening it to an instrument of slaughter.If you listen to and accept the teachings about the Gods from those who interpret myths with wisdom, and if you carefully follow the customs observed by the priests, and if you believe that having a true understanding of the Gods is the most pleasing offering you can make, you will avoid a great misfortune: the fear of demons.

The shortest version of the myth, with all the unnecessary parts removed, is as follows:

Footnotes:

1. "Pathemata" refers to experiences or sensible knowledge in the context of mysteries.
2. This could also mean "the fear of the Animal" or the World Soul, if "Dog" is interpreted symbolically.
3. The ideogram of a newborn child with its finger on its lips seated on a lotus symbolized "sunrise," both externally and internally. The idea of "re-kindling" was likely symbolic of a "new birth from above."
4. The priests possibly used this story to illustrate broader truths. A similar tale is told about Cambyses; they also referred to Ochus as "Ass."
5. The sacrificial knife is mentioned again.
6. Compare to another text.
7. This might refer to "his name of power."
8. Or it could mean "the turn" related to Egypt's fate.
9. "Atheism" could be another interpretation.
10. Generally translated as "superstition."

The Mystery-Myth:

They say that when Rhea secretly united with Kronos, Helios sensed it and cursed her not to give birth in any month or year.Hermes, being in love with the Goddess, united with her. Then, while playing draughts against Selene, he won the seventieth part of each of the lights. He took these five days and added them to the 360 days, which the Egyptians call the "added days" and celebrate as the birthdays of the gods.

They say that on the first day, Osiris was born, and a voice proclaimed at his birth, "The Lord of all comes to light." Some say that a woman named Pamyle, who was blessed by a holy place of Zeus, heard a voice telling her to announce loudly that "Great King Osiris is born." Because of this, she nursed Osiris, who was entrusted to her by Kronos, and they celebrate the Pamylia festival in his honor, similar to the Phallephoria.

On the second day, they say Aroueris was born, whom they call Apollo, or Elder Horus. On the third day, Typhon was born prematurely, breaking through violently. On the fourth day, Isis was born in moist conditions. On the fifth day, Nephthys was born, whom they also call End, Aphrodite, and sometimes Victory.

They say that Osiris and Aroueris were from Helios, Isis from Hermes, and Typhon and Nephthys from Kronos. Because of this, the kings considered the third of the "added" days to be unlucky and refrained from consulting or serving themselves until night.

Nephthys was married to Typhon. However, Isis and Osiris, being in love, united even before they were born, in the womb beneath the darkness.

Some also say that Aroueris was born this way and that he is called Elder Horus by the Egyptians and Apollo by the Greeks.When Osiris was king, he immediately freed the Egyptians from their wild, animal-like existence. He introduced them to fruits, established laws, and taught them to honor the gods. Later, he traveled the world, bringing order without using weapons. Instead, he charmed people with persuasion, reason, songs, and the arts of the Muses. Because of this, the Greeks equate him with Dionysus.

While Osiris was away, Typhon didn't rebel because Isis was vigilantly guarding and holding power. But when Osiris returned, Typhon cunningly conspired with seventy-two men and an Ethiopian queen named Aso.

Typhon secretly measured Osiris’s body and crafted a beautifully decorated chest to match his size. During a banquet, Typhon presented the chest and promised to give it to whoever could fit inside it perfectly. 

As everyone tried but failed to fit, Osiris lay down in the chest. Immediately, Typhon's conspirators slammed the lid shut, fastened it, poured hot lead over it, and threw it into the river, sending it out to sea through the Tanitic mouth, which is still called by a hateful name by the Egyptians today.These events are said to have occurred on the seventeenth of the month Athur, during which the Sun passes through Scorpio, in the twenty-eighth year of Osiris' reign. However, some say he had lived that long but not necessarily reigned.

When the Pans and Satyrs living around Chemmis first sensed the distress of Osiris and started spreading the news, sudden disturbances and emotional reactions came to be known as "panics." When Isis learned of what happened, she cut off one of her curls and put on mourning clothes. This is why the city is named Kopto, which some believe means "privation," as the Greek word "koptein" means to deprive.

Isis then wandered everywhere, asking everyone she met, including children, about the chest. Some children had seen it and showed her the spot where Typhon's friends had thrown it into the sea. Because of this, Egyptians believe that children have prophetic abilities and often pay attention to their voices when they play and shout in holy places.

Isis discovered that Osiris, unknowingly, had fallen in love with and united with her sister Nephthys, leaving behind a honey-clover wreath as proof. Nephthys, fearing Typhon, had abandoned the child she bore. With great effort, Isis found the child with the help of dogs and raised him. This child, called Anubis, became her protector and is said to guard the gods as dogs guard humans.She learned about the chest from him: it had been tossed ashore by the sea in the Byblos region, where it gently came to rest in a heather bush. 

The heather bush soon grew into a large, beautiful tree that completely enclosed and hid the chest within itself. The King, amazed by the size of the tree, cut off its branches and shaped the trunk, which concealed the chest, to use it as a pillar for his roof. 

When Isis heard about these events through a divine voice, she traveled to Byblos. She sat by a fountain, sad and weeping, and spoke to no one. However, she showed kindness to the Queen's maids, styling their hair and leaving a wonderful fragrance on their skin. 

The Queen, noticing the delightful scent on her maids, desired the same for herself. She invited Isis to the palace and made her the nurse of her child. The King was named Malkander, and the Queen's name was either Astarte, Saosis, Nemanous, or Athenais in Greek.

Instead of breastfeeding the child, Isis fed it by putting her finger in its mouth. At night, she would burn away its mortal elements, and, transforming into a swallow, she flew around the pillar, singing a mournful song. The Queen, spying on her and crying out when she saw the child being burned, interrupted the process and thus deprived the child of its immortality.When the Goddess revealed herself, she claimed the pillar of the roof. She carefully took it down, removed the heather-tree around it, wrapped it in fine linen, and poured sweet herb juices over it. She then gave it to the royal couple. To this day, the people of Byblos venerate the wood in the holy place of Isis.

Regarding the coffin, she clung to it and mourned so intensely that the king's younger child died. Taking the older child and the coffin, she placed them on a boat and sailed away. When the River Phaedrus caused a rough wind at dawn, she became angry and dried up the stream.

When she finally found solitude, she opened the chest, laid her face on his, kissed him, and cried. A child approached silently from behind, and when she noticed, she turned and gave him a fearsome look, causing him to die from the awe. Some say he fell into the river instead. He is honored because the Egyptians hymn "Maneros" at their feasts in his memory. Others say the boy was named Palaestinos or Pelousios, and a city was named after him when the Goddess founded it. Maneros, they say, was the first to discover the art of the Muses.

However, some believe "Maneros" is not a person's name but a phrase used during feasting, meaning "May such things be present in proper measure!" The Egyptians shout this at such occasions, guided by the term "Maneros."The image of a dead man carried around in a small wooden coffin is not a reminder of the Osirian passion, as some believe. Instead, it serves to remind people, while they are drinking wine, to enjoy the present moment, since everyone will soon be like the man in the coffin. This often brings a sobering reflection after the revelry.

They say that when Isis went to visit her son Horus, who was being raised at Boutos, she had hidden the chest containing Osiris’s body. However, Typhon, with his dogs, discovered it one night by the light of the moon. Recognizing the body, he tore it into fourteen pieces and scattered them.

Upon learning this, Isis searched for the pieces in a papyrus skiff through the marshes. This is why those who sail in papyrus boats are not harmed by crocodiles, either because the crocodiles fear or revere the goddess.

Because of this, there are many tombs of Osiris in Egypt, as Isis performed burial rites whenever she found a piece of his body. Some say she made replicas of the parts and distributed them to various cities, so each city would honor Osiris. This was also to confuse Typhon, so he would not find the true tomb if Horus were defeated.

The only part of Osiris that Isis did not find was the phallus, because it was thrown into the river and eaten by certain fish, which are considered sacred. Isis then made a replica and consecrated it, leading to a festival that Egyptians still celebrate in honor of this event.After Osiris came to Horus from the unseen world, he guided and trained him for battle. He asked Horus what he thought was the most noble act, to which Horus replied, "Helping parents in trouble." Then Osiris asked which animal is most useful in battle. When Horus answered "Horse," Osiris was surprised and wondered why he didn’t say "Lion." 

Horus explained that while a lion is helpful to someone in need, a horse can chase down and completely defeat the enemy. Hearing this, Osiris was pleased that Horus was ready. It is said that many joined Horus, including Thueris, Typhon's concubine. When a serpent chased her, Horus's followers killed it. To commemorate this, people today cut a small rope into pieces for everyone to see.

The battle lasted many days, and Horus emerged victorious. However, when Isis captured Typhon, she did not kill him but instead released him. Horus was upset by this and removed the crown from his mother's head, but Hermes replaced it with a headdress of cow horns. 

It is also said that when Typhon tried to challenge Horus's legitimacy, Hermes defended Horus, and the gods declared Horus legitimate. Typhon was defeated in two more battles. After Osiris's death, Isis gave birth to Harpocrates, who was born prematurely and weak.In the simplest terms, the text can be modernized and clarified as follows:

278:4 The most basic meaning of the word "aisthomenon" comes from "sqrtais," a longer form of "ai" (similar to "aiu").

278:5 "Meni met' eniaytui" both relate to roots meaning "one" in ancient languages; "men" equals "m-eis" (Aeolian) and "enos" equals "an-nus" (Latin). Compare "eis," "m-ia," "en"; hence, "eni-aytos" means "one-same." Therefore, the Goddess, without the Sun, could only give birth in a single day.

278:6 "Pettia,"--"pessos" was an oval-shaped stone used in a game similar to our draughts; it was also used for the game board, which was divided by five straight lines each way, creating 36 squares.

278:7 This refers to the moon.

278:8 Or "taking away."

279:1 This refers to the lights.

279:2 "Epagomenais"--or "now intercalated."

279:3 This is a very confusing statement. The "lights" likely do not refer to the moon's phases, which are 30 in total. It more likely relates to the number 360, the 70th part of which is approximately 5*142857—a number close to our calculations. The word "each" in the text might be a mistake.

279:4 A voice from heaven, a Bath-kol, coming from the Womb of Rhea.

279:5 "Pamile" likely plays on "pan" (all) and "yle" (matter).

279:6 "Ydreyomenen" probably by the Great Moistener; it is usually translated as "drawing water."

279:7 This refers to the "Phallus-Bearing."

279:8 Possibly referring to Heru-ur (Horus the Elder).

279:9 "Pleura" means "rib" in humans; it also refers to the side of a square, or the root of a square (or cubic) number. Typhon would be represented by the diagonal.

280:1 This is Typhon's birthday.

280:2 A strange sentence; but since the kings were considered gods, they likely worshipped themselves or at least their own spirit and consulted themselves as oracles.

280:3 Possibly because they were opposites or hated each other.

280:4 Compare with chapter 4.

280:5 Metaphors reminiscent of the symbolism in the so-called Book of the Dead.

280:6 This means "namely."The text discusses various symbolic interpretations of Osiris and other mythological elements, aiming to modernize and simplify the language without changing its meaning:

The term "of wild beasts" can also mean "softening," as Osiris represents Water, and "civilizing." Osiris is considered the Logos. In ancient times, "music" referred to all the arts governed by the nine Muses, daughters of Zeus. Dionysos translates to "he of the Mount of Zeus." The term "sovereignty" is also mentioned. This possibly refers to the original concept of the Alchemical Azoth. Ethiopia, south of Egypt, was seen as the land of black magicians, contrasting with the good magicians of Egypt (from the Egyptian perspective). The Osiris myth was easily adaptable to magic and conjuration, similar to how it is depicted in Demotic folk tales of Khamuas in Griffith's "Stories of the High Priests of Memphis." Ethiopia also symbolized the Dark Earth, as opposed to the Light Heaven. The "body of Osiris" can represent the cosmos or the "body of Adam" in the Kabbalah. In Gnostic terms, "greatness" refers to the great cosmos and the cosmic body of man. Pythagoreans might describe it as "an oddly ordered rectangular encasement," possibly referring to a specific configuration of cosmic atoms. A plate in Isaac Myer's Qabbalah, titled "Forma Exterior Arcae Noe ex Descriptione Mosis," depicts a coffin with the dead Christ inside, symbolizing the "germ" of the cosmic robe of the purified man, or the "robe of glory." In mysticism, metaphors are often mixed, reflecting the apotheosis of syncretism.^281:7 The "drinking together" likely refers to the alignment of certain cosmic forces and, on a smaller scale, to souls experiencing joy or festivity before being born. ^282:1 In terms of reincarnation, this means proving that the "permanent atoms" belong to him. ^282:2 This refers to sacred rivers like the Nile and Jordan. The Stream of Ocean symbolizes the birth of humans when it flows downwards and the birth of gods when it flows upwards. ^282:3 "tan-itikou" is probably a play on words related to "stretch," meaning the "wide-stretched mouth of the Great River." Compare this to the Titans or Stretchers. ^282:4 Copt. Hathor corresponds roughly to November. ^282:5 Compare to xlii. 4. ^282:6 These are two classes of elemental beings. ^282:7 Apu, known to the Greeks as Panopolis, is now called Akhmim, derived from an ancient Egyptian name. See Budge, op. cit., ii. 188. ^283:1 "pathos" refers to the events enacted in the mystery drama. ^283:2 As Mother Nature. ^283:3 Meaning "I cut" and, in the middle voice, "I cut or beat the breast" as a sign of mourning. ^283:4 "The depriving of power" or "negation"; Osiris represents the fertilizing or generative power. ^283:5 Refers to the passage or way. In young children, the life force is not sexually polarized. ^283:6 "aggeion" means a vase or vessel, and "metaggizein" means to pour from one vessel to another. "Metaggismos" is the Pythagorean term for reincarnation or rebirth. ^283:7 This paragraph interrupts the story to explain the myth of Anubis's birth. ^284:1 Refers to Nephthys. ^284:2 "Meli-lote" translates to "honey-lotus" in Greek, referring to various plants. Compare to xxxviii. 5. ^284:3 Her legitimate husband.Here is the text converted into modern English, with corrections and simplifications:

The Greeks often used the term for the servants, agents, or watchers of the higher Gods. For example, the Eagle is referred to as the "winged dog" of Zeus. The word "dog" signifies a power of the World, Soul, or Great Animal, and also of individual souls.

"Papyrus" refers to Byblos, a city in the Papyrus Swamps of the Delta.

The term "ereike" likely plays on the root meaning of "ereikein," which means "to quiver." The Egyptian erica was taller and bushier than modern varieties. It may also refer to the tamarisk or be called a mulberry tree.

The "coffin" here may signify the "permanent atom" in man.

This refers to the ruler of the form-side of things.

On the so-called "Gnostic" gems, a lopped trunk is often a symbol, likely the lopped "five-branched" form.

Notice the three stages of awareness: (i) the babbling of children, (ii) the intelligence given by the dog, and (iii) the daimonian spirit of a voice (Hebrew Bath-kol).

When Isis first lost Osiris, she cut off a curl.

This seems to play on the Semitic word "MLK" or Malek, meaning "king," and the Greek word "andr," meaning "man"—thus, "king of men."

The name "Nemanos" or similar variants like Asparte, Sooses, Neimanoe, have been inconsistently copied over time.

The ancients had an art of translating names, as Plato tells us in the Story of Atlantis, where Solon or the priests of Sais translated Atlantic names into Greek. There is likely a word-play intended here. Isis was primarily known as a Nurse, "titthe," an intensification of "ti-the," derived from "sqrttha," meaning "suckle." The common form of "nurse" was "ti-the'-ne."Athenais is a derivative of Athena, who is known as the virgin goddess because she was born from the head and did not nurse. In mythology, Athenais was the wife of Alalkomeneus, the hero of a city in Boeotia where there was an ancient temple dedicated to Athena. In a Pindaric ode, Alalkomeneus is referred to as one of the equivalents for the "first man." The child's name was Diktys. The word "dek" in "daktylos" is said to be the same as in "deka," meaning "ten," which symbolizes perfection. The term "croaking" like a raven matches the "twittering" of the swallow. This suggests that Isis, as the Divine Mother, strives for perfection, while the earthly mother hinders this. The term "erica" is also mentioned. In the New Testament, Jesus's body was wrapped in fine linen with sweet herbs. The term "to xulon" is used for the cross. The word "faidros" means bright, beaming, or shining, representing the sun. The word "pneuma" means breath. The phrase "at sunrise" is mentioned. There is a reference to the boat of Isis. The name Man-erus could mean either "love of understanding" or "understanding of love." The term "palaistinos" might be a play on "palaistes," meaning a wrestler, hence a rival or suitor. Pelusium refers to the eastern mouth of the Nile. There's a note suggesting that "Buto" might stand for a city or be a word-play.Could it be related to Bootes, the Ploughman, or the constellation Arcturus, suggesting a celestial journey or a transformation of the world-soul or an individual's soul? Budge (p. 192) provides its Egyptian equivalent as Per-Uatchit, meaning "House of the Eye."

^288:2 Literally, from her feet.
^288:3 Literally, vessel, which may also mean "cell."
^288:4 Commonly, "hunting."
^288:5 Possibly a play on the word di-elein, which means "tear to pieces."
^288:6 Referring to the crocodiles.
^288:7 It’s notable how Plutarch occasionally includes seemingly naive superstitions without explanation. These can't all be mere hearsay. It might be significant that the "chest" first drifts to the Papyrus country and that Isis's baris is made of papyrus. This could symbolize a "vehicle" safe from the "crocodile" of the deep. In other words, the skiffs are not paper boats, and the crocodiles are not just alligators.

^289:1 "And Egypt they say is the body," to quote Hippolytus regarding the "Gnostics."
^289:2 Presumably referring to the fourteen sacred ones.
^289:3 Lepiduton.
^289:4 Fagron.
^289:5 Oxurygxon.
^289:6 Anthropologically, "taboo."
^289:7 The exact meaning of the "fourteen parts" of Osiris is uncertain. One possibility is that they are connected to what are now called "permanent atoms," representing seeds of life. Another interpretation could be that they symbolize a series of powers derived from past incarnations, related to the birth of Christ-consciousness.

^290:1 Hades.
^290:2 The "Horse" could symbolize purified passion, while the "Lion" might represent a receptive power of the mind.
^290:3 The white "Horse" was likely contrasted with the red "Ass" of Typhon, representing the purified vehicle of the soul versus the impure. "Lion" was a grade in the Mithraic Mysteries and considered a sun-animal.
^290:4 For example, Ta-urt (Budge, op. cit., p. 193).### The Under-Meaning: A Reflection of a Certain Reason

**XX.**
1. These are roughly the main points of their myth, after removing the most negative parts, such as the story about Horus being cut into pieces and Isis being beheaded.
2. However, if people believe and say these things about the Blessed and Incorruptible Nature, which is how the Divine understands itself, as if they actually happened, you should reject and cleanse such thoughts, as Aeschylus advises. There is no need to tell you this because you naturally disapprove of those who hold false and barbaric views about the Gods.
3. But these stories are not just meaningless tales or empty fabrications, like those created by poets and writers who spin them out of nothing. Instead, they contain certain truths and statements, which you already understand.And just as mathematicians say that the rainbow is the sun's reflection, creating many colors when its light bounces back from a cloud, so too the myths here are reflections of certain ideas, bending their thoughts back to other things. This is suggested by the sorrowful elements in sacred rituals and the layout of temples. Temples have open areas like courtyards and walkways that are exposed to the sky, but they also have hidden, dark underground rooms for storing coffins and burial spots.

CONCERNING THE TOMBS OF OSIRIS

5. The belief of the Osirians, who say Osiris's body is in many places, supports this idea. 6. They claim Diochite is called Polichne because it alone has the true body of Osiris. They also say many wealthy and powerful Egyptians are buried in Abydos, aiming to share a burial place with Osiris. Additionally, they believe Memphis raises Apis, the image of Osiris's soul, because his body is there too. 7. Some interpret the City as the "Harbor of Good Things," while others call it the "Tomb of Osiris." However, they say the small island at Philae is generally inaccessible, not even birds or fish go near it. At certain times, priests cross over to make offerings to the dead and place wreaths on a monument overshadowed by a tree larger than any olive tree.Eudoxus says that although many tombs are mentioned in Egypt, the body of Osiris is actually at Busiris, his native city. However, Taphosiris needs no additional explanation because its name means "Burying of Osiris." He also talks about wood cutting, linen tearing, and pouring of libations, as these actions are part of the mysteries associated with Osiris.

The priests say that the bodies of not only these gods but also all other gods that are neither eternal nor indestructible are buried after their work is done and they have been served. Their souls shine in the heavens as stars. For example, the soul of Isis is called Dog by the Greeks and Sothis by the Egyptians, Horus’s soul is called Orion, and Typhon's soul is called Bear.

They also say that the Egyptians, except those in Thebaid, pay dues for the burials of honored animals. The inhabitants of Thebaid do not pay these dues because they believe no god can die. They believe their god Kneph is eternal and immortal.The main herb mentioned was sainfoin or lucerne, which, while it reminds us of melilotus from the 14th century, is unlikely to symbolically overshadow a tomb.

The phrase seems to be a quote from Eudoxus. The "cutting of wood" probably refers to a tree trunk with its branches cut off, a common feature on so-called "Gnostic" gems. The "rending of linen" might be linked to Linus, the bard who was torn apart like Osiris; "Linos" also refers to the "Song of Linus," named so because in ancient times, the strings of the cithara (a musical instrument) were made from flax. For other singer names used for songs, compare with Maneros and Paean. Nowadays, we tend to see the singer as the embodiment of the song. In Emil Naumann's *History of Music* (translated by F. Praeger, 1882), it is noted that various ancient cultures, including Greek tribes, Egyptians, Phoenicians, and Greeks from the Aegean islands and Cyprus, had a funeral chant for the death of the young Adonis. The Egyptians adapted this into a lament of Isis for Osiris. The Greeks called it "Linos," and the Egyptians called it "Maneros."

Naumann gives the beginning of the "Maneros" or the Lament of Isis for her Beloved as follows:

"Return, oh, return! God Panu, return! Those that were enemies are no longer here. Oh lovely helper, return, 
That you may see me, your sister, 
Who loves you. And do you not come near me? O beautiful youth, return, oh, return! When I do not see you, 
My heart sorrows for you, 
My eyes always seek you, 
I roam about for you, to see you in the form of the Nai, 
To see you, to see you, you beautiful loved one. Let me, the Radiant, see you 
God Panu, All-Glory, see you again!"Come to your beloved, blessed Onnofris,
Come to your sister, come to your wife,
God Urtuhet, oh, come! Come to your consort!

Unfortunately, Naumann does not provide references to verify his statements. The bodies mentioned likely refer to the mummies of those men and women believed to have reached a god-like status during their lifetimes. Possibly, these names are puns: kuun (dog), sqrtky (conceive)—see lxi. 6; H-or-os (Horus), Or-ion (Orion); ark-tos (bear), sqrtark (suffice, endure, bear). Ursa Major is called the Wain. Thrice-Greatest Hermes, Vol. 1, by G.R.S. Mead, [1906], at sacred-texts.com.

CONCERNING THE THEORY OF EVEMERUS

XXII. 1. Since many such tombs are discussed and pointed out, those who believe these myths celebrate the awe-inspiring and mighty deeds and sufferings of kings and tyrants who, through exceptional virtue and power, claimed divinity, and later faced misfortune, find an easy escape from the true reason (logos) by transferring the ill-omened elements from gods to men. They support their views with the following narratives. 

2. For example, the Egyptians say that Hermes had a short body, Typhon had red skin, Horus was white, and Osiris was black, as if they were people born naturally. 

3. Additionally, they call Osiris "General" and Kanobus "Pilot," from whom the star got its name. They claim that the ship the Greeks call Argo is an image of Osiris's boat, constellated in his honor, and that it sails near Orion and Dog, which Egyptians see as sacred boats of Horus and Isis, respectively.But I fear that this is like trying to move the unmovable and fighting against not just many centuries, as Simonides says, but against many nations of people who hold strong religious beliefs about these gods. People change these powerful names from heaven to earth, diminishing the sense of worship and faith that has been ingrained in nearly everyone since birth. This opens the door wide for atheism and reduces the divine mysteries to mere human actions, giving free rein to the falsehoods of Evemerus the Messenian. He created baseless myths, spreading atheism by turning all gods into mere historical figures like generals, admirals, and kings, who he claims existed in the past and are recorded in golden letters at Panchon. However, no one, Greek or non-Greek, has ever seen these records—only Evemerus, during his supposed journey to the Panchoans and Triphyllians, who never existed.

And yet, the mighty deeds of Semiramis are sung about among the Assyrians, and those of Sesostris in Egypt. Even today, the Phrygians call splendid and marvelous deeds "manic," because of Manes, a strong and good king from their past, also known as Mazdes. Cyrus led the Persians and Alexander the Macedonians, conquering nearly the entire world; yet, they are remembered only as good kings.If some people, inflated by excessive pride and youthful ignorance, have accepted titles like gods and received temple dedications, their glory has been short-lived. They soon faced the consequences of their vanity, deceit, irreverence, and indecency. 

Death came quickly for them, and they vanished as swiftly as smoke.

Now, like runaway slaves who can be legally captured, they have been removed from temples and altars, leaving only their tombs and graves.

For instance, Antigonus the Elder, when a poet named Hermodotus called him "Son of the Sun and God," remarked, "Even my chamber pot servant doesn't think that highly of me." Similarly, the sculptor Lysippus criticized the painter Apelles for depicting Alexander with a thunderbolt in his hand, arguing that a spear would have been more appropriate and enduring, reflecting Alexander's true legacy.The capital is believed to be on the mythical island of Panchaea, supposedly located on the southern coast of Asia. Evemerus claimed he had sailed there on a voyage down the Red Sea. King notes that the common title of the Sassanian kings was "Masdesin," meaning "servant of Ormazd." This bold statement was made during an era when emperors were often deified. The poet referenced appears to be unknown, as noted by Bergk.

THE THEORY OF THE DAIMONES

1. Those who believe that the stories about Typhon, Osiris, and Isis are not about gods or humans but about powerful daimones are more accurate. According to Plato, Pythagoras, Xenocrates, and Chrysippus, who followed ancient theologians, these daimones are more manly than humans and possess greater strength. However, their nature is a mix of soul and body, making them capable of experiencing pleasure, pain, and other passions, which affect them to varying degrees.

2. The stories of the Giants and Titans in Greek mythology, the lawless deeds of Kronos, the conflicts between Python and Apollo, Dionysus's escapes, and Demeter's wanderings are similar to the tales of Osiris and Typhon. These stories, often told in myths, are meant to be kept secret from the general public through sacred rites and rituals.Moreover, we frequently hear Homer referring to good people as "godlike," "equal to gods," or as receiving guidance from gods. However, he uses terms related to daimones for both worthy and unworthy individuals alike:

"Approach them, daimonian! Why do you fear the Argives?"

And:

"But when he charged for the fourth time, he was like a daimon."

And:

"O daimonian! What great harm have Priam and his sons done to you that you rage so fiercely against Troy's well-built city?"

This suggests that daimones have a mixed and unstable nature. For this reason, Plato attributes "right" and "odd" things to the God on Olympus, and things that respond to these to the daimones.

Furthermore, Xenocrates believes that days marked by misfortune, as well as holy days involving punishments, fasting, blasphemies, or foul language, are not related to honors given to gods or beneficent daimones. Instead, they are associated with powerful but difficult and sullen beings who enjoy such activities and are placated by them. 

Hesiod also calls the beneficent and good beings "holy daimones" and "guardians of men," describing them as "wealth-givers and possessors of this sovereign prerogative."

Plato refers to this group as intermediaries between gods and humans, conveying men's prayers upward and bringing prophetic answers and good things back down.

Empedocles, on the other hand, states that daimones must correct any mistakes they make or any discords they cause:

"Aether's rush drives them towards the sea; the sea spits them onto land; the earth pushes them into the rays of the tireless sun; and the sun throws them back into the swirls of aether."One person passes them on to another, and everyone hates them until, after being disciplined and purified, they return to their natural place and rank.

1. They say that Typhon's legends, born from the same source as these stories, tell how he committed terrible acts out of envy and malice, causing chaos and spreading suffering across the earth and sea. Eventually, he made amends for his actions.

2. Osiris's sister and wife, who defended his honor, calmed Typhon's madness and fury. She ensured that the struggles and trials they endured, along with her own wise and brave deeds, were not forgotten. By blending pure rituals with symbolic representations of her suffering, she created a religious lesson and provided comfort to those in similar situations.

3. Through their virtue, she and Osiris transformed from good spirits into gods, just like Heracles and Dionysus later did. They hold the status of both gods and spirits, with significant influence in both the heavens and the underworld.### Modern English Version

The quote seems irrelevant to me because Empedocles appears to be talking about "those who sinfully defile their bodies" and not about daimones. However, the accepted arrangement of the fragments might be incorrect. 

*See the note on "sister-wife" in the comments on Mariamne (Hipp., Philos.--Introd.) in the chapter on "Myth of Man." --Prolegg., p. 147, n. 7. 

According to this theory, the myth represents the stage of initiation where a man transitions from the state of a daimon to that of a god, or from a super-man to a christ.*

**Concerning Sarapis**

They say that Sarapis is actually Pluto, and Isis is Persephassa, as Archemachus of Euboea and Heracleides of Pontus have suggested. Heracleides also believed that the oracle at Canopus was Pluto's. 

Ptolemy the Saviour had a dream where he saw a giant statue of Pluto, though he had never seen or known what it looked like before. The statue instructed him to bring it to Alexandria.

Ptolemy didn't know where the statue was, even after describing his vision to his friends. Then, a well-traveled man named Sosibius said he had seen a similar colossus in Sinope. 

Ptolemy sent Soteles and Dionysius, who, after much effort and with some divine help, secretly moved the statue to Alexandria. 

Once it was set up publicly, the assistants of Timotheus, the interpreter, and Manethos, the Sebennyte, concluded that it was a statue of Pluto based on its cerberus and huge serpent. They convinced Ptolemy that it was actually Sarapis. The statue didn’t have this name when it arrived from Sinope but was given the Egyptian name for Pluto, Sarapis, once it was in Alexandria.People often fall into the belief of Heracleitus, the physicist, who says: "Hades and Dionysus are the same, for whoever they rage and riot." Those who think Hades represents the body and the soul is like a drunk person within it, offer a weak explanation. It's better to identify Osiris with Dionysus and Sarapis with Osiris after he has transformed. "Sarapis" is a common name, just as those who participate in the sacred rites know "Osiris" is.

It’s not worth paying attention to the Phrygian writings that say Isis was the daughter of Charops, son of Heracles, and Typhon was the son of Aeacus, also son of Heracles. Nor should we heed Phylarchus when he writes that Dionysus first brought two oxen from India to Egypt, named Apis and Osiris, and that Sarapis comes from "sweeping" or "cleaning," which some interpret as "beautifying" and "adorning." These statements by Phylarchus are absurd. Even more so are those who say Sarapis is not a god, but the coffin of Apis, and that certain bronze gates at Memphis, called "Gates of Oblivion and Wailing," open with a mournful sound when they bury Apis, causing us to fall into oblivion every time we hear brass. More reasonable are those who say the simultaneous motion of the universe is called Sarapis, from words meaning "speed." However, most priests say that "Osiris" and "Apis" are combined into one name, teaching that we should see Apis as a living image of the soul of Osiris.If the name Sarapis is indeed Egyptian, I believe it means "Good Cheer" and "Delight," as Egyptians call their feast "Delights" or Sairei. Plato also says Hades is called this because it is "sweet" and gentle to those with him. The Egyptians have many names with meanings, and they call the underworld, where they believe souls go after death, Amenthe, which means "the place that takes and gives."

Whether this name is one of those that left Greece long ago and has returned, we will examine later. For now, let’s continue with the current topic.

1. Osiris and Isis have transformed from benevolent spirits into gods. Although Typhon's power has greatly diminished and is nearing its end, people still try to appease it with certain offerings and feasts.

2. Occasionally, during specific festivals, they humiliate Typhon terribly. They even roll red-skinned men in the mud and drive a donkey off a cliff, as done by the people of Koptos, because Typhon was said to have red skin and resemble a donkey. The people of Busiris and Lycopolis avoid using trumpets because they sound like a donkey braying.

3. Generally, they consider the donkey to be unclean and a demonic animal due to its resemblance to Typhon. They make round cakes for offerings during the months of Payni and Phaophi, stamping them with the image of a "tied donkey."4. During the Feast of Offerings of the Sun, worshippers are instructed not to wear gold or feed an ass.

5. The Pythagoreans believe Typhon is a demonic power. They claim Typhon was created on the fifty-sixth even measure and that the power of the equilateral triangle represents Hades, Dionysus, and Ares; the square represents Rhea, Aphrodite, Demeter, and Hestia (Hera); the dodecagon represents Zeus; and the fifty-six-sided polygon represents Typhon, as Eudoxus explains.

XXXI. 1. Egyptians believe Typhon was born with red skin, so they sacrifice only red oxen. They inspect the animals closely and if they find even a single black or white hair, they deem it unfit for sacrifice. They believe sacrificing such an animal would not please the gods because these animals are thought to contain the souls of impure and unrighteous people.

2. After cursing the victim's head and beheading it, they used to throw it into the river, but now they give it to strangers.

3. The priests, known as Sealers, mark the animal to be sacrificed with a seal. According to Kastor, this seal depicts a man kneeling with his hands tied behind his back and a sword at his throat.

4. They also associate the ass with Typhon due to its stubbornness, wild behavior, and its skin.Because they particularly despised Ochus, the Persian king, for being bloodthirsty and abominable, they nicknamed him "Ass." Ochus responded, "This Ass will make a feast of your Ox," and then killed the Apis, as Deinon has recorded.

Additionally, those who claim that Typhon escaped on an ass for seven days and, after reaching safety, fathered sons named Hierosolymus and Judaeus, are clearly inserting Jewish elements into the story.Deinon was a contemporary of Alexander the Great and wrote a history of Persia. This piece of ancient gossip seems like something Apion might have written; it's an interesting example of theological debate in the form of a story. 

THE THEORY OF THE PHYSICISTS

The information above offers us certain ideas. Now, let's consider the simplest explanations from those who appear more philosophical. These individuals say that just as the Greeks use myths to represent time as Kronos, air as Hera, and changes in air into fire as the birth of Hephaestus, the Egyptians have similar stories. For example, Osiris uniting with Isis (the earth) represents the Nile River, and Typhon represents the sea, where the Nile disappears and scatters, except for the part absorbed by the earth, which then becomes fertile.

There is a sacred lament about Kronos, mourning "him who is born in the left-hand and died in the right-hand parts." The Egyptians believe the eastern parts of the world are the "face," the northern parts are the "right hand," and the southern parts are the "left hand." The Nile, flowing from the south and ending in the sea to the north, is said to be born in the left hand and die in the right hand.

Therefore, the priests consider the sea impure and call salt "Typhon's foam." One of their main rules is not to put salt on the table. They also do not greet sailors because they use the sea for their livelihood. This is why they consider fish to be offensive and have signs that say, "Hate fish!"

At Sais, at the entrance of the temple of Athena, there used to be carvings of a "baby," an "old man," a "hawk," a "fish," and finally a "hippopotamus."This meant in symbols: "O you who are being born and dying, God hates shamelessness." The "babe" symbolizes birth, the "old man" symbolizes death, the "hawk" represents God, the "fish" symbolizes hatred due to its association with the sea, and the "hippopotamus" represents shamelessness because of the myth that it kills its father and violates its mother.

Additionally, the Pythagoreans say that the sea is the tears of Kronos, which might suggest why it is not pure. These points are commonly known.

The more knowledgeable priests not only call the Nile Osiris and the sea Typhon, but they also call any source of moisture Osiris, viewing him as the cause of life and essence of seed. Typhon represents anything dry, fiery, and hostile to moisture. They believe Typhon was born with a pale, reddish-yellow body, so they avoid people with this appearance. Conversely, they say Osiris was born black because Nile water blackens everything it touches, and moisture in youth makes hair black, while aging leads to greying due to dryness.

Spring is blooming and productive, while autumn, lacking moisture, is harmful to plants and animals. The ox kept at Sun-city, called Mnevis, sacred to Osiris and sometimes considered the sire of Apis, is also black and holds second honors after Apis.Furthermore, they call Egypt "Chemia" because of its especially black soil, similar to the black of the eye, and they compare it to a heart. This is because Egypt is warm and moist, and mostly located in the southern part of the civilized world, just like the heart is on the left side of a person.

They also believe that the sun and moon do not use chariots, but sail around in boats, symbolizing their nourishment and birth from the "Moist." They think that Homer, like Thales, believed that Water is the source and origin of all things, having learned this from the Egyptians. They identify Oceanus as Osiris and Tethys as Isis, who together nurture and raise everything. 

The Greeks also use terms related to water for many concepts: they call "emission of seed" ap-oysian, "intercourse" syn-oysian, and "son" (yion) from "water" (ydatos) and "moisten" (ysai). They refer to Dionysus as Hues, the lord of Moist Nature, equating him with Osiris. 

Hellanicus, a prominent Greek historian, seems to have learned from Egyptian priests to call Osiris "Hu-siris," which relates to Osiris' nature and inventive power.However, who would know better than you, Klea, that he is the same as Dionysus? You are the Archi-charila of the Thyiades at Delphi and were dedicated to Osiris before your birth.

But if we need to provide evidence for others, let's keep the sacred things where they belong. The rituals the priests perform when burning the Apis and transporting its body on a raft are very similar to a Bacchic Orgy. They wear fawn-skins, carry thyrsuses, and shout and dance like those celebrating the Mysteries of Dionysus.

Many Greeks depict Dionysus as bull-formed. The women of Elis pray for "the god with the bull's foot" to come to them. The Argives call Dionysus "bull-born" and summon him from the water with trumpets, throwing a lamb into the abyss for the Gate-keeper. They hide the trumpets in thyrsi, as Socrates mentioned in his "Books on Rites."

The Titanic Passions and the Dionysian Night-rites align with the stories of Osiris being torn apart, revived, and reborn, as well as with the tales of his burials. Egyptians point to Osiris's tombs everywhere, and the Delphians believe Dionysus's remains are kept near the Oracle. The Holy Ones offer a secret offering in Apollo's shrine when the Thyiades awaken "Him of the winnowing fan."

Pindar confirms that the Greeks see Dionysus as the lord of not just wine, but all moist nature when he sings: "May gladsome Dionysus make the pasturage of trees to grow--Pure light of autumn." This is why those who worship Osiris are forbidden from destroying cultivated trees or blocking water sources.### Footnotes

^310:5 The text reads "arxikla," which seems to be a nonsensical collection of letters. Since no one has corrected this reading yet, I suggest the terms "xarilan" or "arxi-xarilan." Stending, in Roscher's dictionary, reminds us of the myth of the orphan girl Charila. During a famine, Charila begged for alms at the palace gates of the King of ancient Delphi. The King not only refused her but also struck her face with his shoe. Ashamed, Charila hanged herself. After the famine ended, the Oracle demanded atonement for her death. Consequently, every nine years, an effigy representing Charila was executed and then carried away by the leader of the Thyiades (priestesses of Bacchus) and buried with a rope around its neck in a gorge. Refer to Jane E. Harrison's "Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion" (Cambridge, 1903), p. 106. Since Klea was the leader of the Thyiades, this duty fell to her. It is possible that her name is a play on Charila.

### THE THEORY OF THE PHYSICISTS RESUMED

XXXVI. 1. They refer to not only the Nile but also all forms of moisture as "Osiris' efflux." In the processions honoring the God, the priests always carry a water-vase at the front.
2. The word "rush" is used to denote "king" and the "southern climate" of the cosmos. "Rush" is interpreted as "watering" and "conception" of all things and is thought to resemble the generative organ.
3.When they celebrate the festival of Pamylia, which is a phallic festival, they carry around an image with a phallus three times its normal size. This is because God is the source of creation, and any source, through the power of generation, multiplies what comes from it. We often refer to "many times" as "thrice," as seen in phrases like "thrice-blessed." The ancient people may have used "threefold" in its true meaning since the Moist Nature, which is the origin and creator of all things, first moved the three primary elements: earth, air, and fire.

The myth that Typhon threw the main part of Osiris into the river and that Isis, unable to find it, created a substitute and instituted the Phallephoria festival in its honor, teaches us that the generative powers of the God were originally moist and mixed with other elements to create life.

Another Egyptian myth says that Apophis, the brother of the Sun, waged war against Zeus. Osiris fought alongside Zeus and helped him win, leading Zeus to adopt Osiris as his son and call him Dionysus. This myth suggests a truth about nature: the Egyptians equate the Cosmic Breath with Zeus, which is opposed by Dry and Fiery elements, not the Sun but related to it. By dampening the excess dryness, moisture strengthens the exhalations that nourish and empower the Breath.

Additionally, both Greeks and Egyptians associate ivy with Dionysus. Among Egyptians, ivy is known as chen-osiris, meaning "Osiris-plant."Ariston, who wrote "Colonies of the Athenians," found a letter from Alexarchus. In it, Alexarchus mentions that Dionysus, the son of Osiris and Isis, is called Arsaphes by the Egyptians, which means "manliness." Hermaeus, in his book "Concerning the Egyptians," supports this by stating that "Osiris" translates to "Strong."

I disregard Mnaseas, who linked Dionysus, Osiris, and Sarapis with Epaphos, and Anticleides, who claimed that Isis, the daughter of Prometheus, lived with Dionysus. The unique aspects of the festivals and offerings provide clearer evidence than these accounts.

The Egyptians consider the star Sirius to represent Isis because it brings water. They honor the Lion and decorate the temple doors with lion's mouths, as the Nile overflows when the Sun enters the constellation of the Lion.

They believe the Nile is an extension of Osiris, and the earth is the body of Isis, specifically the parts covered by the Nile, which fertilizes her. From this union, Horus is born. Horus represents the season and the beneficial air that sustains life. He was nurtured by Leto in the marshes around Buto, as the wet earth promotes growth and reduces dryness.

They name the edges of the land, where it meets the sea, Nephthys, calling her the "End." They say she lives with Typhon.When the Nile overflows its banks more than usual and reaches the outer regions, people say Osiris has united with Nephthys. This is evident from the growth of plants, especially honey-clover. Typhon discovered the betrayal when honey-clover, which fell from Osiris, was left behind. As a result, Isis gave birth to Horus in a legitimate union, while Nephthys secretly had Anubis. 

In the records of the Kings, it is noted that when Nephthys married Typhon, she was initially barren. If this refers to the Goddess rather than a woman, it symbolizes the land's unproductive nature due to infertility.

The conspiracy and tyranny of Typhon represent the power of drought overcoming and dispersing the moisture that feeds and increases the Nile.

Typhon's ally, the Ethiopian queen, brings southern winds from Ethiopia. When these winds overpower the annual winds that drive clouds towards Ethiopia, they hinder the rains that swell the Nile. As a result, Typhon takes over and scorches the land, forcing the Nile, weakened and low, to empty into the sea. The myth of Osiris being locked in a coffin likely symbolizes the hiding and disappearance of water.They say that Osiris disappeared in the month of Athyr, when the annual flooding of the Nile stops completely, the river recedes, the land becomes barren, nights grow longer, darkness increases, and the power of light wanes. During this time, the priests perform various solemn rites. They cover a gold statue of a cow with a black linen cloth to mourn for the Goddess, as they see the cow as a symbol of Isis and the earth. They display this statue for four days, starting from the seventeenth.

The mourning is for four things: the Nile receding, the northern winds being overpowered by southern winds, days becoming shorter than nights, and the earth becoming bare as trees shed their leaves. On the night of the nineteenth, they go to the sea. The priests carry a sacred chest containing a small gold vessel, which they fill with fresh water while the assistants shout as if Osiris has been found.

They then mix fertile soil with this water, along with sweet spices and fragrant incense, and shape it into a small moon-shaped figure made of precious materials. They decorate it, showing that they believe these gods are the essence of earth and water.

When Isis finds Osiris again and helps Horus grow strong with the help of moisture and clouds, Typhon is subdued but not destroyed. The Goddess of the earth did not completely eliminate the nature opposed to moisture; she only weakened it, wanting to maintain a balance. The cosmos could not be perfect if the fiery element ceased to exist.If these ideas are not improbable, it is also likely that we shouldn't dismiss the story that Typhon once took over Osiris's share because Egypt used to be a sea.

For this reason, many places in its mines and mountains still contain shells, and many springs and wells have brackish and bitter water, as though they are remnants of the ancient sea. Over time, Horus overcame Typhon; that is, after a good season of rains, the Nile pushed out the sea and made the land reappear by depositing silt. Our senses confirm this because we see that as the river deposits fresh mud, the land gradually extends, and the deep water retreats as the sea bottom rises with sediment.

Additionally, we see that Pharos, which Homer described as a day's sail from Egypt, is now connected to it. This isn't because the island moved closer to the shore, but because the intervening sea has been pushed back by the river's reshaping and adding to the mainland.

These explanations are similar to the theological ideas of the Stoics. They say that Dionysus represents the generative and nutritive spirit, Heracles the forceful and separating spirit, Ammon (Zeus) the receptive spirit, Demeter and Kore the spirits extending through the earth and fruits, and Poseidon the spirit extending through the sea.**Text in Modern English:**

**From "Thrice-Greatest Hermes," Vol. 1, by G.R.S. Mead, [1906], at sacred-texts.com**

**THE THEORY OF THE MATHEMATICI**

**XLI. 1.** Those who combine the considerations of the Physicists with some of the mathematical doctrines derived from astronomy believe that the solar cosmos is called Typhon and the lunar cosmos is called Osiris.

2.The Moon, with its light that promotes growth and moisture, is considered beneficial for the breeding of animals and the sprouting of plants. In contrast, the Sun, with its intense and harsh heat, burns and withers growing things, making much of the earth uninhabitable and often overpowering the Moon. This is why Egyptians refer to Typhon as Seth, meaning "the one who oppresses and constrains by force."

There is a myth that Heracles resides in the Sun and accompanies it in its revolutions, while Hermes does the same with the Moon. The Moon's movements are considered to resemble rational thought and abundant wisdom, while the Sun's movements are seen as powerful and forceful.

Moreover, the Stoics believe the Sun's fire is sustained by the sea, whereas the Moon receives a sweet and mild exhalation from springs and lakes.

According to Egyptian myth, Osiris died on the seventeenth day of the month, when the full moon is at its peak. The Pythagoreans call this day "Interception" and see the number seventeen as significant. The number sixteen is a square, and eighteen is an oblong, both having their perimeters equal to their areas. The number seventeen, which lies between them, separates and disrupts their relationship, dividing the ratio of nine to eight into unequal parts.

Some say that Osiris lived or reigned for twenty-eight years, which corresponds to the number of days in the Moon's cycle.During the ceremonies for Osiris' burial, they carve a tree trunk into a crescent-shaped coffin. This is because, when the Moon nears the Sun, it becomes crescent-shaped and then disappears. The story of Osiris being torn into fourteen pieces symbolizes the days the Moon wanes from full to new moon. The day when the Moon reappears after hiding behind the Sun is called "Imperfect Good" because Osiris, whose name means many things but mainly "Mighty and Good-doer," is associated with goodness. Another name for Osiris, Omphis, translates to "Benefactor."

They also believe the rising of the Nile is linked to the Moon's phases. The highest rise, around Elephantine, is twenty-eight cubits, matching the Moon's monthly cycle. The lowest rise, around Mendes and Xois, is six cubits, representing the half-moon, while the average rise, around Memphis, is fourteen cubits, representing the full moon.

They see the Apis bull as a living symbol of Osiris, conceived when the Moon's light impregnates a cow in heat. The markings on Apis, with light and dark patterns, resemble the Moon's phases. During the new moon of the month Phamenoth, they celebrate a festival called "Entrance" of Osiris into the Moon, marking the start of spring. By placing Osiris' power in the Moon, they signify that Isis is both his partner and the cause of his birth.For this reason, they call the Moon the Mother of the cosmos and believe she has both male and female qualities. She is filled and made pregnant by the Sun, and then she releases and spreads generative principles into the air. They say she doesn't always overcome the destruction caused by Typhon, but even when she is temporarily defeated, she uses her generative power to free herself and fight her way back to Horus. Horus represents the cosmos surrounding the Earth, which is also subject to both destruction and creation.

Some interpret this myth as a riddle about eclipses. The Moon is eclipsed when it is full and the Sun is directly opposite, as it enters the Earth's shadow, similar to how Osiris entered the coffin. The Moon also hides the Sun and makes it disappear on the thirtieth day of the month, but it doesn't completely destroy it, just as Isis didn't completely destroy Typhon.

When Nephthys conceives Anubis, Isis adopts him. Nephthys represents what is below the Earth and hidden, while Isis represents what is above the Earth and visible. The circle touching both, called the "Horizon," is named Anubis and is likened to a dog because a dog can see both day and night. Anubis holds a position of power among Egyptians, similar to Hecate among the Greeks, being both chthonian (underworld) and olympian (heavenly).

Some believe Anubis is Kronos, who creates everything from himself and contains everything within himself, hence the name "Dog" (kyw'n in Greek). There is a mystery about the worship of Anubis that is kept secret.In ancient times, dogs were highly honored in Egypt. However, when Cambyses killed Apis and left its body untouched, only the dog approached it. This act caused the dog to lose its status as the most honored animal. 

Some people believe that the shadow of the Earth, which causes the Moon to be eclipsed, is called Typhon.

THE THEORY OF THE DUALISTS

1. From all this, it seems reasonable to conclude that no single explanation is entirely correct, but that all explanations together might provide the right meaning.
2. Typhon is not defined by drought, wind, sea, or darkness alone, but by all harmful and destructive elements in nature.We shouldn't believe that the fundamental principles of the universe lie in lifeless bodies, as Democritus and Epicurus claim, nor should we assume that a single Reason (Logos) and Providence control everything and shape quality-less matter, as the Stoics suggest. 

It's impossible for something worthless to exist if God is the cause of all, or for something valuable to exist where He is not involved. As Heraclitus says, the cosmos' harmony is reciprocal, like that of a lyre or bow, and as Euripides notes:

There cannot be good things without bad,
But a blend of both makes things fair.

This ancient doctrine has been passed down from theologians and lawmakers to poets and philosophers. It doesn't belong to any one person but has gained strong and lasting credibility. It survives in many traditions, both Greek and non-Greek, not just in words and teachings, but also in secret rituals and public ceremonies. 

The universe is not mindless, without reason or guidance, nor is it controlled by a single Reason as if directed by a rudder or reins. Instead, it consists of many things, a mix of good and evil. Nature rarely produces anything completely pure; it’s not like a bartender mixing drinks from two jars. Rather, from two opposing principles and powers—one leading things rightly and the other causing chaos—life becomes a mix, and the cosmos around the Earth, if not the entire cosmos, is irregular, variable, and changeable in every way.If nothing comes into existence without a cause, and Good cannot be the cause of Bad, then both Good and Bad must have their own origins and principles.

This is the belief of many wise people. Some think there are two rival gods: one creating good things and the other creating worthless things. Others refer to the better one as "God" and the other as "Daimon," like Zoroaster the Mage, who supposedly lived five thousand years before the Trojan War.

Zoroaster called the good one Oromazes and the bad one Areimanios. He said that Oromazes is like light, and Areimanios is like darkness and ignorance, with Mithres in between. This is why the Persians call Mithres the Mediator. Zoroaster also taught them to offer joyful prayers to Oromazes and sorrowful supplications to Areimanios. 

They would crush a plant called "moly" in a mortar, invoke Hades and Darkness, mix it with the blood of a wolf, and then cast it into a dark place. They believed that some plants and animals belonged to the Good God and others to the Evil Daimon. For instance, dogs, birds, and hedgehogs were of the Good God, while water-rats were of the Bad. They considered it fortunate to kill many water-rats.

They also told many mythical stories about the gods. For example, Oromazes, born from pure light, and Areimanios, born from darkness, are at war. Oromazes created six gods: those of good mind, truth, good order, wisdom, wealth, and the creator of sweet and fair things. Areimanios created six rival gods to oppose them.Then Oromazes, after tripling himself, moved far away from the sun, as far as the sun is from the Earth, and decorated the heavens with stars. He placed one star, Sirius, above all others as a guardian and lookout. He then created twenty-four other gods and put them into an egg. The gods created by Areimanios, equal in number, broke through the egg, mixing good and evil together. 

According to fate, a time will come when the pestilence and famine released by Areimanios will be completely eradicated by these good gods. The Earth will become flat and level, leading to a unified way of life and government where everyone is happy and speaks the same language.

Theopompus mentions that the Magi believe that for three thousand years, one of the gods conquers while the other is defeated, and for another three thousand years, they fight and undo each other's work. Eventually, Hades will fail, and humans will be happy, needing no food and casting no shadows. The god who orchestrated this will rest for a period, which is short for a god but equivalent to a man's sleep.

The Magi's myths generally follow this pattern.

Additionally, the Chaldaeans say that among the planets, which they consider birth-presiding gods, two are beneficial, two are harmful, and three are neutral. Greek beliefs are well-known, attributing good fortune to Olympian Zeus and adversity to Hades. They also have a myth that Harmony is the child of Aphrodite and Ares, with Ares being harsh and conflict-driven, and Aphrodite being gentle and loving.Heracleitus clearly calls "War" the "father, king, and lord of all" and criticizes Homer for wishing that strife and hatred would cease, as he believes conflict and opposition are the sources of all creation. He also states that:

"The Sun will not exceed its limits, or else the Furies, the guardians of justice, will punish it."

The Pythagoreans, in a list of names, describe the qualities of Good as: One, Finite, Stable, Straight, Odd, Square, Equal, Right, Light; and those of Bad as: Two, Infinite, Moving, Curved, Even, Oblong, Unequal, Left, Dark—believing these are the fundamental principles of creation. 

Aristotle describes Good as Form and Bad as Privation. Plato, though often concealing his views, refers to these opposite principles as Same and Other. 

In his later work, the Laws, Plato states more clearly that the cosmos is moved not by one soul but likely by several, at least two—one being good and the other being its opposite, causing negative things. However, he omits mentioning a third, intermediate nature, which is neither soulless, irrational, nor motionless, but instead relies on both and always seeks the better.

It is understood that the creation and composition of the cosmos involve opposing forces, but the dominant force is the Better one.It is impossible for evil to be entirely destroyed, as it is deeply embedded both in the body and in the soul of the universe, always in a constant struggle with good.

In the soul of the cosmos, Mind and Reason, the guide and ruler of all that is good, is represented by Osiris. This order and health are reflected in the earth, air, water, heavens, and stars, evident in the seasons, temperatures, and cycles.

Typhon represents the chaotic, irrational, and impulsive side of the soul. In the physical realm, he embodies death, disease, and disruption, causing unseasonable weather and obscuring the sun and moon, as if these disturbances were Typhon's doing. The name Typhon is another name for Seth, which means "oppressor" or "one who turns things upside down."

Some say one of Typhon's companions was Bebon, while the historian Manetho claims that Typhon himself was also called Bebon, meaning "hindering" because Typhon's power obstructs progress and movement towards goals.

In terms of animals, Typhon is associated with the most unmanageable domestic animal—the ass—and the most savage wild animals—the crocodile and hippopotamus. We've already discussed the significance of the ass. In Hermes-city, they display an image of Typhon as a hippopotamus with a hawk fighting a snake on its back. The hippopotamus represents Typhon, while the hawk represents power and rule, indicating that Typhon often seizes power by force and perpetuates disorder through evil.On the seventh day of the month Tybi, which they call the "Arrival of Isis from Phoenicia," they make offerings and place a bound hippopotamus on cakes.

In the city of Apollo, it is customary for everyone to eat a piece of crocodile. On a specific day, they hunt and kill as many crocodiles as possible and throw them in front of the temple. They believe that Typhon escaped from Horus by turning into a crocodile. They consider all harmful animals, plants, and experiences to be the works and parts of Typhon.

Osiris is depicted with an "eye" and a "scepter," symbolizing his providence and power. Homer refers to Zeus as "supreme counsellor," indicating his supremacy and good counsel. Osiris is also often depicted with a "hawk," representing his keen sight, swift flight, and ability to sustain himself on minimal food. Hawks are said to cover the bodies of the unburied dead with earth and avoid crocodiles by setting their wings upright when drinking from the river.

Everywhere, Osiris is shown as a man-shaped figure, ithyphallic, symbolizing his generative and abundant nature. His statue is dressed in a flame-colored robe, as they view the sun as the body of the Good's power, a visible sign of an essence that can only be conceived by the mind.Therefore, we should ignore those who claim that the sun's sphere belongs to Typhon. Typhon represents chaos and destruction, not light, health, order, or creation. We should not blame the sun for droughts that kill many animals and plants. Instead, these are caused by the improper mixing of air and water on earth, driven by disorderly and uncontrolled forces that create discord and extinguish the vital exhalations.

In the sacred hymns to Osiris, he is invoked as hidden in the arms of the sun. On the thirteenth of the month of Epiphi, they celebrate the Birthday of the Eye of Horus with a feast, as the moon and sun align. They believe both the moon and the sun are the eyes and light of Horus. On the eighth day of the waning phase of Paophi, they celebrate the Birthday of the Sun's Staff after the autumn equinox, symbolizing the sun's need for support as its heat and light diminish and it moves obliquely away from us.

Just after the winter solstice, they carry a cow around the shrine seven times, calling this ritual the Seeking for Osiris. This symbolizes the Goddess's longing for the sun's "water" during winter. They circle seven times because the sun moves from the winter to the summer solstice in seven months.

Horus, the son of Osiris, is said to have been the first to make offerings to the sun on the fourth day of the waxing moon, as written in the Birthdays of Horus. Additionally, every day they offer three types of incense to the sun: resin at sunrise, myrrh at noon, and "kuphi" at sunset. The reasons for these specific offerings will be explained later.And with all these actions, they aim to make the Sun favorable to them and to serve him. But why gather many such signs? Some people directly say that Osiris is the Sun and is called Sirius by the Greeks, although the Egyptians' use of the article has led to a misunderstanding of the name. They also claim that Isis is the Moon, which is why her statues with horns represent her crescent, and the black-robed ones symbolize her eclipses and shadowings as she follows the Sun, longing for him. Therefore, they invoke the Moon for matters of love; Eudoxus says that Isis decides love affairs.

These explanations have a certain degree of plausibility, whereas it is not even worth listening to those who say that the Sun is Typhon. But let us ourselves return to the proper reasoning.Jesus answered Mary, "A Day of Light equals a thousand years on Earth, so thirty-six thousand five hundred years on Earth make up a single Year of Light."

The absence of a shadow was believed to be a trait of souls not attached to the body; however, here it refers to those who are aligned with the Spiritual Sun.

THE PROPER REASON ACCORDING TO PLUTARCH

LIII. 1.Isis represents the feminine aspect of Nature and the capacity to encompass all creation. Plato referred to her as the "Nurse" and "All-receiving," while the general public called her "She of ten-thousand names" due to her ability to transform through Reason (Logos) and take on various forms. She has a deep love for the highest and most sacred things, which are synonymous with Goodness, and she seeks and pursues these. Conversely, she repels and avoids the realm of Evil. Although she embodies both good and bad, she tends to favor the Good, allowing it to influence her and bring forth its likenesses, which she embraces and takes pride in nurturing.

Generation is the manifestation of Essence in Matter, and Becoming is the reflection of Being. Therefore, it is understandable that myths say the soul of Osiris is eternal and indestructible, while Typhon often tears apart his body, making it disappear, and Isis searches for and reassembles it. The true, mentally conceivable, and Good is beyond destruction and change. However, the images and forms that the physical world imitates, like seal impressions in wax, do not last forever. They are disrupted by chaotic elements from above, which oppose Horus, the physical representation of the cosmos that Isis brings forth.

Thus, Typhon accuses Horus of being illegitimate, not pure and untainted like his father, Reason (Logos), which is unmixed and unchanging. Instead, Horus is mixed with matter due to his physical nature.Nevertheless, Horus prevails and wins, thanks to Hermes—representing Reason (Logos)—who demonstrates that Nature mirrors the true Cosmos by changing her forms according to the mind's conception.

The birth of Apollo from Isis and Osiris, which occurred while the gods were still within Rhea, symbolizes that before the physical cosmos was revealed and Matter was perfected by Reason, Nature, being imperfect, produced her first creation. Thus, they say that God was lame in darkness and call him Elder Horus; he was not the cosmos, but an image and shadow of the world to come.

But this Horus, our Horus, is their son, perfected and complete. He has not destroyed Typhon entirely but has harnessed his power and strength. That's why the statue of Horus at Coptos holds Typhon's virility in one hand. Additionally, the myth says that Hermes cut Typhon's sinews and used them for lyre strings, teaching us how Reason brought harmony to the universe, creating order from discord. He did not destroy the destructive power but weakened it. Thus, while it is weak and ineffective above, down here, by being intertwined with the changeable elements, it causes earthquakes, droughts, tempests, and lightnings. It also infects waters and winds with diseases and sometimes reaches up to the moon, darkening its light, as Egyptians believe.

They also say that Typhon sometimes strikes the Eye of Horus, and at other times takes it out and swallows it.When they say "striking," they are referring mysteriously to the moon's monthly decrease, and by "blinding," they mean its eclipse, which the sun fixes by shining on it right after it leaves the earth's shadow.

The superior and divine Nature consists of two things: the Intelligible and Matter, from which the Greeks derive the Cosmos. Plato often referred to the Intelligible as the Idea, Model, and Father, and to Matter as Mother and Nurse—the place and foundation of creation, with creation being the offspring of both. It seems the Egyptians also honored the most perfect triangle, comparing the nature of the universe to it; Plato, in his Republic, also seemed to use this analogy in his marriage scheme.

This triangle has a perpendicular side of "three," a base of "four," and a hypotenuse of "five," with its square equalling the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

We should compare its perpendicular side to the male, its base to the female, and its hypotenuse to their offspring. Osiris represents the source, Isis the receptacle, and Horus the result.

The number "three" is the first odd and perfect number, while "four" is a square number derived from the even number two. The number "five" resembles both its father and mother, being made up of "three" and "two." The word "all" (panta) is closely related to "five" (pente), and counting is often done in fives. The number five forms a square that matches the number of letters in the Egyptian alphabet and the lifespan of Apis in years. Therefore, Horus is also called "Min," meaning "being seen," because the cosmos is visible and perceptible. Isis is sometimes called "Muth," "Athyri," or "Methyer."By the first name, they mean "Mother"; by the second, "Cosmic House" of Horus, as Plato also calls her "Ground of Genesis" and "She who receives"; and the third name combines "Full" and "Cause," because Matter is full of the cosmos and associates with the Good, Pure, and Ordered.

Hesiod, when he describes the first elements as Chaos, Earth, Tartarus, and Love, could be seen as referring to the same principles. If we substitute Isis for Earth, Osiris for Love, and Typhon for Tartarus, then Chaos appears to represent the underlying space of the universe. Our interpretation also aligns with Plato’s myth in the Symposium about the birth of Love, where Poverty, wanting children, lies beside the sleeping Means and conceives Love, who is of mixed nature. This Love can take any shape, being the child of a good and wise father who is self-sufficient, and a needy mother who constantly seeks fulfillment from others.

The character Means represents the First Beloved, Desirable, Perfect, and Sufficient; Matter is represented by Poverty, who lacks Goodness herself but is always filled and sustained by it. The cosmos, represented by Horus, is born from these. Though Horus is not eternal, impervious to suffering, or indestructible, he remains ever-young and escapes destruction through continuous cycles of change and renewal.

We should use myths not as absolute sacred truths but by extracting the useful elements that resemble reason.When we talk about Matter, we shouldn't be misled by some philosophers who think of it as a lifeless, quality-less, and inactive substance. For example, we call oil the "matter" of a perfume, and gold the "matter" of a statue, even though they have qualities. We also consider the soul and human thoughts as the "matter" of knowledge and virtue, shaped by reason.

Some believe that the mind is the "region of ideas" and the "impressionable substance" of intelligible things. Others think that a woman's substance is not a source of power, but rather the matter and nourishment for birth.

If we agree with these ideas, we should view the Goddess as eternally connected to the First God, drawn to His goodness and beauty. She is never opposed to Him, just as a good wife loves her husband and desires him even while being with him. We should think of Her as clinging to Him and seeking Him, always filled with His purest parts.

However, when Typhon intervenes, taking away the last parts, She appears sorrowful, mourning, and searching for the remnants of Osiris. She wraps them in her robes, absorbs them when they are destroyed, hides them away, and then reproduces and releases them again.The reasons and ideas of God in heaven and the stars remain forever, but those that spread into things on earth, sea, plants, and animals are dissolved, destroyed, and buried, only to reappear again in new births. This is why the myth says Typhon lived with Nephthys, but Osiris secretly knew her. The last parts of Matter, called Nephthys and End, are mostly controlled by destructive power. However, the Generative and Saving One distributes weak seeds into them, which Typhon destroys, except for those that Isis saves, nourishes, and puts back together.

He is considered the Better One, as both Plato and Aristotle believe. The generative and moving power of Nature moves towards Him and being, while the destructive power moves away from Him and towards non-being. Thus, the name Isis is derived from hastening and moving with knowledge, as she represents a mindful and prudent motion. Her name is not foreign; just as all gods have names combining "that which can be seen" and "that which runs," we call this Goddess "Isis" from "knowledge," and the Egyptians also call her Isis.

Plato also says the ancients referred to the "Holy Lady" as "Isia," representing Mental Perception and Prudence, as she embodies the course and motion of Mind hastening and moving. They placed Understanding—essentially, Good and Virtue—in things that flow and run. Conversely, the Bad is criticized with names like "badness," "difficulty," "cowardice," and "distress," as these hinder nature and prevent it from moving forward.Osiris's name comes from combining "holy" and "sacred." There is a common reason (Logos) for things in heaven and the underworld—ancients called heavenly things sacred and underworld things holy. The reason that brings heavenly things to light and deals with ascending things is called Anubis, or sometimes Hermanubis, depending on whether he is dealing with above or below. 

Anubis is offered a white rooster for his role in the heavenly realm and a saffron-colored one for his role in the underworld, symbolizing purity for the former and diversity for the latter. We shouldn't be surprised at the adaptation of names into Greek, as many names have changed with those who moved from Greece and now reside with foreigners. Some blame poets for these changes, calling such words "glosses."

In the "Books of Hermes," it is written that the power governing the Sun's revolution is called Horus, while the Greeks call it Apollo. The power that rules the Breath or Spirit is called Osiris, Sarapis, or Sothis in Egyptian. Sothis means "conception," and the star Sothis, associated with Isis, is called Dog (kuun) in Greek by inversion of the name.

We shouldn't be too concerned about the names, but if we were, I would prefer to give up "Sarapis" over "Osiris" since I think Sarapis is foreign while Osiris is Greek. However, both names refer to the same God and Power. The Egyptian names also resemble these Greek ones.The Egyptians often refer to Isis by the name Athena, which means "I have come from myself," indicating a self-directed course. Typhon, as mentioned earlier, is called Seth, Bebon, and Smu—names that signify resistance, opposition, or reversal.

They also call the magnet "Bone of Horus" and iron "Bone of Typhon," as Manethos notes. This is because iron sometimes behaves like it is attracted to the magnet and follows it, and other times it is repelled and moved in the opposite direction. Similarly, the beneficial and rational motion of the cosmos attracts and moderates the harsh and chaotic motion, eventually absorbing and neutralizing it.

Eudoxus reports that the Egyptians tell a story about Zeus, who could not walk because his legs were fused together. Out of shame, he lived in isolation until Isis separated his legs, allowing him to walk properly.

This myth symbolically suggests that the Mind and Reason (Logos) of God, after developing internally in the invisible and hidden realm, came into being through motion.The imperfect birth (abortion) of Sophia (wisdom, nature, Isis) resulted from her attempt to create without her partner while still in the Pleroma (womb of Rhea). This event sets the stage for a significant form of Gnostic cosmology and soteriology, where the Creator Logos and Savior must perfect the flawed product of nature. This, I believe, is the first time that Plutarch's passage has been connected with the Sophia myth, and previous translations have misunderstood its meaning. See F. F. F., pp. 339 ff.; for the Pauline use of the term "abortion," see D. J. L., pp. 355 ff.; for "Balaam the Lame Man" (possibly a nickname for Jeschu-Horus), see ibid., p. 201. Reitzenstein (pp. 39, 40) quotes these chapters and adds parallels from Trismegistic literature.

The text explains: "Amsu is Horus, the avenger of his father, and his coming forth is his birth."The feathers on his head represent Isis and Nephthys, who stand there as his protectors and provide what his head lacks. Alternatively, they are seen as the two great uraei (serpent symbols) on the head of their father, Tem. Another interpretation is that his two eyes are the feathers on his head.

Mut, associated with Amen, means "Mother" and she was considered the World-mother. 

"Athyr" likely refers to Hathor.

The text contains references to various works and plays on words. For example, in Theogony, lines 116-122, and Symposium, 203 B, Jowett’s translation, volume i, pages 573 and following, there are wordplays such as "aporon," a play on "poros."

The term "ekmageion" appears in Plato's Timaeus, 50 C, and Theaetetus, 191 C, 196 A. "To sperma teis gynaikos" literally means "the seed of the woman."

"Barbarikon" refers to non-Greek or foreign. There are several wordplays involving "theos" (god), "theatos" (spectator), and "theon" (divine).

Plutarch seems to have mistaken the wordplay involving "ten osian" as it actually involves "oysian" and "esian," not "osian" and "isian."

In Cratylus, 415 D, the wordplay is between "arete" (virtue) and "aei-reite" (ever-flowing), and in 415 C, between "kak-ia" (vice) and "kakus ion" (badly going).

"Apor-ia" is a play on "a" (not) and "por-euesthai" (going).

"Deilia" signifies the soul being bound with a strong chain, as "lian" means strength, thus expressing the strongest bond of the soul.

"Hades" refers to the invisible realm, not specifically Tartarus.

Horus had attributes of other gods. For example, combined with Anubis as Heru-em-Anpu, or Hermanubis, he was said to dwell in the "divine hall."

**The Symbolism of the Sistrum**

**LXIII. 1.** The sistrum (a rattle-like instrument) symbolizes that all things must be in constant motion and never stop. It suggests that things need to be stirred and awakened when they become dormant or lifeless.

**2.** It is said that the sistrum is used to drive away Typhon, symbolizing that when corruption halts nature, generation revives and energizes it through movement.

**3.** The sistrum has a curved top and contains four elements that are shaken. The part of the cosmos that undergoes generation and decay is bounded by the sphere of the moon, and everything within it is affected by the four elements: fire, earth, water, and air.

**4.**On the top of the sistrum's arch, they placed a metal figure of a cat with a human face. At the bottom, below the rattling parts, they sometimes showed the face of Isis and sometimes Nephthys. These faces symbolize creation and completion, representing the changes and movements of the elements. The cat symbolizes the moon due to its changing nature, nocturnal habits, and fertility.

It is said that cats give birth to one kitten, then two, then three, four, and five, adding one more each time until they reach seven. In total, this makes twenty-eight kittens, matching the number of days in the lunar cycle. Although this is likely more myth than fact, it is true that a cat's pupils become full and dilate during the full moon, and contract as the moon wanes. The human face on the cat signifies the intellectual and reasonable nature of the moon's changes.

Footnotes:

^344:2 King translates "poikilon" as "pied color," suggesting that the original color of the cat was tabby, but this is not certain. ^345:1 This idea comes from a mystical theory adapted into a popular natural history of the cat, with the myth used as "proof" of the theory.To put it simply, it’s not accurate to consider water, sun, earth, or heaven as Osiris or Isis, nor fire, drought, or sea as Typhon. Instead, we should attribute anything not governed by order to Typhon and respect anything orderly, good, and beneficial as the work of Isis, representing Osiris. This way, we won’t go wrong. 

Furthermore, we can also stop Eudoxus from doubting and being confused about how it is Isis, not Demeter, who oversees love affairs, and Osiris, not Dionysus, who controls the Nile’s flooding and rules over the dead.

We believe that one universal principle (Logos) has appointed these gods over all good domains, and everything good in nature originates from Osiris, with Isis receiving and distributing these blessings.

AGAINST THE WEATHER AND VEGETATION GOD THEORIES

We will also address those people who associate the myths about these gods with weather changes or agricultural cycles, such as claiming Osiris is buried when sown seeds are underground and revives when they sprout. They also say Isis ties an amulet around her neck on the sixth day of the first half of the month Phaophi when she feels pregnant, and Harpocrates is born around the winter solstice, immature and representing early sprouting plants.For this reason, they offer him the first fruits of growing lentils and celebrate days of thanksgiving for a safe delivery after the spring equinox. They love to hear and believe these things, drawing conviction from what is familiar and customary. 

However, there is nothing to complain about if, firstly, they honor the Gods alongside us and do not make them exclusive to Egyptians. They should not claim that only the Nile and the land it waters are blessed by the Gods, nor should they say that marshes, lotuses, and god-making are their exclusive rights, thereby depriving the rest of mankind who lack a Nile, Buto, or Memphis of the Great Gods. Indeed, everyone knows and honors Isis and her company of Gods. Even if some only recently started calling these Gods by Egyptian names, they have always recognized and respected their powers.

Secondly, and more importantly, they should be careful not to reduce the sacred mysteries to mere natural phenomena like winds, streams, sowing, plowing, and seasonal changes. This is akin to saying Dionysus is just wine, Hephaestus is merely fire, and Persephone, as Cleanthes suggests, is the wind that blows through crops and dies; or like the poet who says of the reapers, "Then when they, lusty, cut Demeter's limbs."

Such views are no different from seeing a pilot as just sails, ropes, and anchors; a weaver as merely yarn and thread; or a physician as just potions and brews. These perspectives introduce dangerous and atheistic ideas by equating the names of Gods with inanimate objects that lack sense or soul and are inevitably used and destroyed by humans. It is not possible to consider such things as Gods in themselves.A God is not something without a mind or soul, nor something controlled by humans. Instead, we understand that those who provide us with endless abundance are Gods. There aren't different Gods for different peoples, like Greek or non-Greek, southern or northern Gods. Just as the sun, moon, earth, and sea are shared by all humans but called by different names, the Reason (Logos) that governs everything and the single Providence managing all powers have been given various honors and titles by different nations according to their laws.

There are sacred symbols, some clear and some obscure, guiding our understanding of the Gods' mysteries, but they come with risks. Some people, completely misled, fall into superstitions, while others, avoiding superstition like a swamp, accidentally fall into atheism like down a cliff.

Therefore, especially regarding such matters, we should use Reason (Logos) as our guide from philosophy to thoughtfully consider each saying and action. This way, we can avoid misunderstanding, as Theodorus mentioned, where some listeners took his words the wrong way, and correctly understand the laws on offerings and feasts. Everything should be related to Reason (Logos), which we can learn from the rituals themselves. For example, on the nineteenth of the first month, during a feast to Hermes, people eat honey and figs, saying "Truth is sweet." The amulet of Isis, which the myth says she wore around her neck, means "True Voice" when interpreted.We shouldn't think of Harpocrates as an imperfect or infant god, or a god of beans, but as the protector and corrector of the immature and unclear understanding people have about gods. This is why he has his finger on his lips, symbolizing silence and discretion.

In the month of Mesore, when they offer beans, they say, "The tongue brings fortune; the tongue is a spirit." They also believe that in Egypt, the persea tree is sacred to the Goddess because its fruit looks like a heart and its leaf like a tongue.

Among all human qualities, nothing is more divine than reason, especially when it concerns the gods, and nothing more significantly influences happiness. That’s why we praise those who approach the Oracle to think and speak reverently about the gods. However, many people act foolishly by speaking irreverently about the gods after participating in religious processions and feasts.

What should we make of those sad and somber sacrifices then, if we must neither ignore traditional rites nor mix up our beliefs about the gods with absurd doubts?

Even among the Greeks, many similar rites are performed around the same time as those in Egypt. For example, in Athens, women fast during the Thesmophoria, sitting on the ground. In Boeotia, people celebrate the festival called Epachthe (the Grief-bringing) as though Demeter mourns for the descent of Kore. This month is also the time for sowing, marked by the rising of the Pleiades, which the Egyptians call Athyr, the Greeks call Pyanepsion, and the Boeotians call Damatrios.Theopompus tells us that Western people call winter "Kronos," summer "Aphrodite," and spring "Persephone," and believe everything is born from Kronos and Aphrodite. The Phrygians think the god sleeps in winter and wakes in summer, celebrating his "Going to sleep" and "Waking up." The Paphlagonians believe he is bound in winter and freed in spring.

1. The time of year suggests mourning when grains are hidden in the earth. The ancients saw grains as gifts from the gods, essential for living beyond a savage existence.

2. When fruits disappeared from trees and their crops were still meager, they would bury seeds with uncertainty, performing rituals similar to mourning.

3. Just as we say someone who buys Plato's books "buys Plato," they called the creations of the gods by the gods' names, honoring them through use.

4. Later people misunderstood this symbolism, believing the changes in nature were the literal birth and death of gods, leading to absurd and confused beliefs.The philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon had an excellent point: if Egyptians believe in Gods, they shouldn't mourn; if they mourn, they shouldn't believe in Gods. It would be absurd for them to mourn and at the same time pray for the crops to grow again, only so they can be consumed and mourned once more.

However, this isn't actually the case. While Egyptians do mourn for the grain, they also pray to the Gods to renew it and make new crops grow to replace what was consumed. There's a wise saying among philosophers: those who don't learn the correct names for things end up using those things incorrectly. For example, some Greeks don't call statues and images representations of the Gods, but Gods themselves. They then claim that Lachares stripped Athena, Dionysius cut off Apollo's golden curls, and Capitoline Zeus was destroyed in the Civil Wars. These people unknowingly adopt harmful beliefs because of their misuse of names.

This issue is particularly true for Egyptians regarding the reverence they show to animals. Greeks correctly view the dove as sacred to Aphrodite, the dragon to Athena, the raven to Apollo, and the dog to Artemis, as Euripides wrote:

"Thou shalt be dog, pet of torch-bearing Hecate."

But many Egyptians worship the animals themselves as if they were Gods. This not only makes their sacred practices a subject of ridicule but also fosters harmful thinking. It leads the simple-minded into superstition and the more skeptical into atheism and crude rationalism.Therefore, it is appropriate to review the theories about these matters.

19. Dr. Budge (referenced work, volume 1, page 29) writes: "The available monuments and texts suggest that the Egyptians initially worshipped animals as animals, and later as dwellings of divine spirits and gods. There is no reason to believe that Egyptian animal worship evolved from a system of totems and fetishes as Mr. J. F. M'Lennan suggested (Fortnightly Review, 1869-1870)." Personally, I believe that the Egyptian animal-cult was mainly based on the idea that life manifested differently in various animal forms, corresponding to the life-currents in the invisible forms or aspects of the Animal-Soul of the Cosmos.

CONCERNING THE WORSHIP OF ANIMALS, AND TOTEMISM

Chapter 72, Section 1.The idea that the Gods transformed into animals like ibises, dogs, and hawks out of fear of Typhon is more far-fetched than any story or trickery. The belief that the souls of the dead are only reincarnated into these animals is equally unbelievable. Some suggest that Osiris, during his great campaign, divided his forces into many groups, each represented by a different animal symbol, which then became sacred to those groups. Others say that later kings, to intimidate their enemies, wore masks of wild animal heads made of gold and silver. Another theory is that a clever king, understanding that the Egyptians were naturally fickle and prone to change but very powerful when united, introduced a lasting superstition to create constant discord. He decreed that different clans should worship different animals, knowing that these animals were naturally hostile to each other and had different dietary needs. This led each clan to protect their own sacred animals and become hostile toward other clans, resulting in ongoing conflicts. To this day, the people of Wolf-town are the only Egyptians who eat sheep, because they revere the wolf as a god.In the town of Oxyrhynchus, when people from Dog-town ate the oxyrhynchus fish, the Oxyrhynchus people caught a dog, sacrificed it, and ate it. This led to a conflict between the towns, and later, the Romans punished them harshly.

Many believe that Typhon's soul is divided among certain animals. This suggests that irrational and brutal natures come from the Evil Daimon, and people worship these animals to appease him. If Typhon brings severe droughts, diseases, or disasters, priests secretly take some revered animals, try to scare and, if necessary, sacrifice them. This act serves as a punishment for the Daimon or a purification method in extreme situations.

In one town, they used to burn living men, known as Typhoneian, to ashes during the Dog-days, scattering the ashes as a form of purification. This public ritual contrasts with the secret sacrifices of sacred animals, which happen at irregular times and are unknown to most people. When these animals die, the priests perform burials in public, believing it annoys Typhon and diminishes his pleasure. Only a few animals, like the Apis, are sacred to Osiris, while most are associated with Typhon.If Osiris is indeed Reason (Logos), then the animals associated with him, like the ibis, hawk, and dog-headed ape, share his honors. Apis, which they call the goat at Mendes, is considered his soul.

Utilitarian and symbolic reasons exist for honoring these animals. For example, the ox, sheep, and ichneumon are honored for their usefulness, much like the Lemnians honor crested larks for eating locust eggs, and Thessalians honor storks for killing snakes. The asp, weasel, and scarab are honored because they resemble certain divine qualities, akin to the way sunlight reflects in water.

The weasel is believed to conceive through its ear and give birth through its mouth, symbolizing the birth of reason (logos). The scarab beetle, thought to have no females, reproduces by rolling balls of matter, resembling the sun's movement across the sky, from west to east. The asp is likened to a star because it does not age and moves smoothly without limbs.

Even the crocodile is honored for a credible reason: it is the only animal without a tongue.The Divine Reason (Logos) does not need a voice, and:

"Silently, with justice, it guides all mortal things."

2. They say that when it is in water, its eyes are covered by a smooth, transparent membrane from the upper lid, allowing it to see without being seen, similar to the First God.

3. When the female lays her eggs on land, it indicates the limit of the Nile's rise. As they can't lay eggs in the water and avoid laying them far from it, they accurately predict the river's rise for laying and hatching their eggs, keeping them dry and safe from water.

4. They lay sixty eggs, which hatch in sixty days, and the longest-living among them live for sixty years, which is the first measure for those studying celestial phenomena.

5. Among those animals honored for both reasons, we've already discussed the dog.

6. The ibis, while killing harmful reptiles, also taught them medicinal cleansing by rinsing and purging itself.

7. The most meticulous priests use water for purification from where the ibis drinks, as it only drinks clean, unpoisoned water.

8. The ibis's leg position relative to its beak forms an equilateral triangle, and its black and white feathers resemble the gibbous moon.We shouldn't be surprised that the Egyptians were fond of simple likenesses, because the Greeks also used similar vague indications in their portrayals of gods.

For example, in Crete, there was a statue of Zeus with no ears, symbolizing that the ruler and lord of all should listen to no one. Pheidias incorporated a serpent into the statue of Athena and a tortoise into the statue of Aphrodite at Elis. The serpent represented the need for virgins to be protected, while the tortoise signified that married women should stay at home and be silent. 

Poseidon's trident symbolizes the third realm, the sea, which was assigned to him after the heavens and the air. This is why the names Amphi-trite and Trit-ons were invented.

The Pythagoreans also associated numbers and shapes with gods. They called the equilateral triangle Athena because it is divided by three lines drawn from its angles. They named the number one Apollo, due to its singularity, and the number two Strife and Daring. The number three was associated with Justice because it represents balance between deficiency and excess.

The Tetraktys, which totals thirty-six, was their greatest oath and is called Cosmos. It is produced by adding together the first four even and odd numbers.If the most respected philosophers, when they saw a hint of the Divine in lifeless and formless things, thought it important not to ignore or disrespect anything, then we should have even more appreciation for creatures that have senses, souls, emotions, and character. We should honor the Divine through them, as they are clearer reflections of God’s work than anything man-made.

We should consider that nothing without a soul is superior to something with a soul, nor something without senses better than one with senses – not even if you gathered all the gold and emeralds in the world. The Divine doesn't reside in colors, shapes, or textures; anything that cannot share in life is of less value than dead bodies.

Living Nature, which sees, moves by itself, and knows what belongs to it and what doesn’t, has a part of the Good and shares in the wisdom that guides the universe, as Heracleitus says.

Therefore, the Divine is portrayed just as well in animals as in artworks made of bronze and stone, which, though also subject to decay and damage, lack feeling and understanding. Regarding the respect given to animals, I believe this view is the most commendable of all that have been mentioned.^356:1 There is a gap here that I have partially filled in with an educated guess.

A notable feature is the structure and placement of the hind legs, which are positioned so close to the end of the body and so far apart that the insect looks very unusual when walking. This unique formation helps them roll balls of dung, in which they lay their eggs. These balls start off irregular and soft but become rounder and harder as they roll along, pushed by the hind legs. Sometimes these balls are 1.5 to 2 inches in diameter, and the beetles almost stand on their heads while rolling them, facing away from the balls." The scarab was called "kheprera" in Egyptian and symbolized Khepera, the Great God of creation and resurrection. Khepera was the "father of the gods" and the creator of everything in heaven and earth, self-created and self-born. He was often associated with the rising sun and rebirth.

The oath was: "By Him who gave our soul Tetraktys, Ever-flowing Nature, Source with roots"—the "roots" being the four elements.

CONCERNING THE SACRED ROBES

LXXVII. 1. Regarding robes: those of Isis are colorful because her power is related to all things—light and dark, day and night, fire and water, life and death, beginning and end. The robe of Osiris, however, is pure and unvariegated like light, as the Source is pure and the First and Intelligible is unmixed. 2. Once they receive this robe, they keep it hidden and safe from all eyes and hands, using the robes of Isis on various occasions. 3.Through practice and experience, we come to understand the many facets of the tangible and accessible things around us, as they constantly change and reveal new aspects of themselves.

However, the understanding of the Intelligible, Pure, and Singular shines through our soul like a lightning flash, perhaps allowing us to connect with and perceive It only once. For this reason, both Plato and Aristotle describe this part of philosophy as "epoptic," meaning that those who rise above the complex and varied opinions reach the Primal One, which is Simple and Matter-less. By grasping the pure truth about It, they believe that philosophy has reached its ultimate goal.

The priests subtly indicate through their rituals and veiled faces that this God is the ruler and king of the dead, known as Hades or Pluto in Greek culture. However, because they don't truly understand this, it confuses people, leading them to think that the sacred Osiris lives on earth and underground, where the bodies of the deceased are buried.

In reality, Osiris is far removed from the earthly realm, pure and untouched by death and decay. Human souls, still bound by their bodies and passions, cannot fully commune with God. They can only get a faint glimpse of Him through a mind trained in philosophy. But when souls are freed from these bonds and reach the Formless, Invisible, Passionless, and Pure state, God becomes their guide and king. They are drawn to His Beauty, which is indescribable and beyond words.
Here is a modern English version of the text, simplified and corrected without altering its original meaning:

---

The ancient story tells us that Isis is always in love, and through her pursuit and union with it, she fills the world with all things beautiful and good, everything that is part of creation. This explanation is more fitting for understanding God.

CONCERNING INCENSE

LXXIX. 1. I must also talk about the daily incense offerings, as I promised. The reader should understand that people have always paid serious attention to things that promote health. This is especially true in sacred ceremonies and rituals, where "healthy" is just as important as "holy." They believed it was wrong to serve the Pure and Perfect with bodies or souls that are unhealthy or diseased. 2. Since the air we use and interact with the most does not always stay the same—it condenses at night and makes the body heavy, causing the soul to feel anxious and despondent, as if weighed down by mist—people burn pine resin incense in the morning to purify the air. The incense breaks down the heavy air and rekindles the spirit within the body, as its strong and penetrating aroma lifts the mood.At midday, noticing that the sun draws a large and heavy vapor from the earth and mixes it with the air, they burn myrrh. Its heat dissolves and disperses the murky mixture in the atmosphere. Physicians seem to help plague sufferers by making large fires, as if to clear the air. It's even more effective if they burn fragrant woods like cypress, juniper, and pine. 

In Athens during the Great Plague, the physician Akron gained fame by advising people to keep fires burning next to the sick, which helped many. Aristotle says that sweet-smelling odors from perfumes, flowers, and meadows contribute to health and enjoyment, because their warmth and softness gently spread through the brain, which is naturally cold and congested.

If Egyptians call myrrh "bal," which translates to something like "dispelling silly talk," this also supports the reason for its use.

Kuphi is a mixture of sixteen ingredients: honey, wine, raisins, cyperus, pine resin, myrrh, aspalathus, seseli, mastic, bitumen, nightshade, sorrel, two types of juniper (large and small), cardamom, and sweet-flag. These ingredients are mixed with sacred texts being read aloud to the perfume-makers.Here is the text converted into modern English:

---

Regarding their number, even though it appears as a square within a square, and it's the only one with equally even numbers that can make the perimeter equal to the area, its usefulness for this purpose is minimal. 

Most of the ingredients, due to their aromatic properties, release a sweet fragrance and healthy vapor. This changes the air and gently soothes the body, helping it to fall asleep and relieve the stress of the day without causing any intoxication.

Additionally, they enhance the mind’s ability to generate and receive dreams, much like how the Pythagoreans played the lyre before sleep to calm and purify the soul's emotional and irrational nature.

Scents can revive the senses or, alternatively, calm them through their soothing effects when their vapors spread through the body. Some physicians suggest that sleep occurs when food vapors gently move inside the body, causing a tickling sensation.

Kuphi is used both as a drink and a mixture. When drunk, it is believed to cleanse the intestines, and when applied externally, it acts as a softening agent. Furthermore, resin is a product of the sun, and myrrh comes from tree sap exposed to sunlight. Some ingredients in kuphi thrive at night, nourished by cool breezes, shade, dew, and moisture.Since daylight is singular and Pindar remarks that the sun is seen "through empty aether", while air is a blend of many lights and properties, like seeds from every star scattered into one field, they naturally use the former as incense during the day, as it is singular and originates from the sun, and the latter when night falls, as it is mixed and varied in its qualities.AFTERWORD

This informative work by Plutarch concludes here. Despite numerous texts and monuments about Osiris and Isis deciphered by Egyptologists, this remains the most comprehensive account of the core mystery-myth of ancient Egypt. The myth of Osiris and Isis dates back to the earliest recorded times and consistently appears in the same form. The "Ritual" or "Book of the Dead," which is more accurately called the "Book of the Living," could aptly be named "The Gospel of Osiris."

It is not appropriate here to delve into the historical origins of this Great Mystery; Osiris certainly was more than just a "water sprite," as Budge suggested. I believe Osiris and Isis were originally cosmic or super-cosmic beings. The Elder and Younger Horus, viewed on a macrocosmic level, represented the Intelligible and Sensible Worlds, and on a microcosmic level, related to the mystery of the Christ-stage of manhood. Some may argue that the ancient Egyptians couldn't have had such sophisticated ideas, but we prefer the tradition of our Trismegistic writings over the "primitive-culture" theories of anthropologists. 

These views were undoubtedly held in the first centuries, as shown by a careful study of Philo of Alexandria. For instance, he wrote about the two Horus figures:

"For this cosmos is the Younger Son of God, as it is perceptible to the senses. The Elder Son, who is not perceptible by senses but only by the mind, is judged worthy of the Elder's rights and remains with God alone."When we talk about the Christ-stage of manhood, we mean everything beyond the normal stage of man, including both the super-man stage and that of Christ. Plutarch is very helpful for understanding the environment in which the students of the Trismegistic tradition lived, so we have given him more attention than the average reader might think necessary.

In a recent book, while discussing the early church document The Shepherd of Hermas in connection with the ancient and mysterious Book of Elxai, which Epiphanius says was circulated among the Essenes, Nazorenes, Ebionites, and Sampsaeans, I wrote:

"It is very interesting to notice the many similarities between the Apocalyptic Hermas and the teachings of the Early 'Shepherd of Men' text from the mystic school that looked to Hermes the Thrice-Greatest for inspiration. This is the earliest part of the Trismegistic literature. But that is another story that hasn't been told yet." 

At the same time, unknown to me, Reitzenstein must have been writing his detailed analysis on "Hermas and Poimandres," reaching almost the same conclusion as I had expressed in a simpler form years earlier. This was when I commented on Hilgers' theory that the "Shepherd of Men" was written in opposition to the "Shepherd of Hermas," and suggested that if there was any dependence, it was exactly the reverse of Hilger's assumption.### The Higher Criticism of "The Shepherd of Hermas"

Modern critics have thoroughly analyzed "The Shepherd of Hermas," much like other early Christian writings that are not part of the canonical Bible. Eusebius referred to these disputed books as Antilegomena. Although some scholars still argue for the unity of the text, most believe it is a composite work. Following Hilgenfeld’s analysis, we can identify three main sections in the document:

1. **The Apocalyptic** - Visions i.-iv.
2. **The Pastoral** - Vision v. to Similitude vii.
3. **The Secondary or Appendix** - Similitudes viii.-x., added by a later editor.

"Hermas i." and "Hermas ii." do not reference any New Testament books, which suggests their early origin.

### The Introduction of the "Pastoral Hermas"

"Hermas ii.," also known as the "Pastoral Hermas," begins as follows:

1. "After I prayed in my house and sat on my couch, a man of glorious appearance entered. He looked like a Shepherd, wearing a white skin, with a bag on his shoulders and a staff in his hand. He embraced me, and I embraced him.

2. "Immediately, he sat down beside me and said: I am sent by the most Sovereign Angel to stay with you for the rest of your life.

3. "I thought he had come to test me, so I asked: Who are you? I know who is in charge of me. He replied: Don’t you know? I am the Shepherd who has been assigned to you.

4. "As he spoke, his appearance changed, and I recognized him as the one who had been assigned to me."**Comparison with Our "Poemandres"**

When we compare the Greek text of this passage with the introductory paragraphs of the "Poemandres," it's clear that their similarities are too precise to be just a coincidence. The verbal agreements are immediately noticeable, even without the help of the large type used by Reitzenstein in his reproduction of the texts. Most striking, however, is the similarity in ideas; in both "Hermas" and "Hermes," the Shepherd is not just a shepherd but a "shepherd of men," akin to how Peter and others became "fishers of men."

It is difficult for anyone who has thoroughly studied both documents to believe that the writer of the philosophical-mystical treatise had the Christian apocalyptic writing in front of him and used it as a starting point. Even if we still hold the traditional view that Christian scripture must have come first whenever there is similarity, it is hard to believe that a copier of "Hermas" would have left no trace of the unique elements like the robe, staff, and wallet of the shepherd, or the conversation that follows in what would be assumed to be the original text.### The Popular Symbolic Representation of the Shepherd

The mystical ideas and atmosphere of the author or editor of our current "Poemandres" are very different from the folk beliefs, which "Hermas" mentioned. These beliefs have described a shepherd in literature since the time of Theocritus. This description was also a symbolic representation of the "Shepherd of Men" in the broader Hellenistic religious mindset. There is clear evidence that Hermes was primarily seen as the "Good Shepherd," and images of him with a staff, wallet, and single robe were popular in the common worship.

In one passage that mentions this wallet and staff, more details are provided, showing that these simple symbols were well understood. The right hand is raised, and the left holds the staff and wallet. Additionally, the staff has a serpent wrapped around it, and Hermes wears a single robe. Like Isis, he stands on the world-sphere, which also has a serpent around it. Here, Hermes represents the Mind or Logos, the creative force of nature (symbolized by the staff and wallet). With his left hand, he brings life into being, and with his right, he leads souls out of life, either to death or rebirth. In this prayer, Hermes (as the sun) is called "the Shepherd who has his fold in the West."

It is also important to note that Hermes is dressed as the "Poor" and the "Naked."

### The Name "Hermas"

But let's return to Hermas. Why is the name "Hermas" used in this context? There is a large body of literature where "Hermes" acts as a seer, prophet, revealer, and writer of sacred texts. In this literature, he is depicted as the beloved disciple of the Heavenly Mind, the Shepherd of Men. But what do we have in Christian tradition to explain the name "Hermas"?There are only contradictory theories attempting to identify a historical Hermas to establish the origin of what is clearly, like most documents from that era, pseudepigraphic. In my view, the name Hermas more clearly indicates the influence of "Hermes" on the Christian writer's apocalyptic work. Hermas was inspired by Hermes, rather than the other way around, contrary to what Hilgers suggested. 

However, this does not mean that Hermas based his apocalyptic settings on the exact text of the "Poemandres" we have today, as our current text is an edited version of an earlier form. If we could recover that earlier form, we would likely find more verbal similarities between Hermas and Hermes.

The mystical and philosophical ideas in the "Poemandres" treatise can be seen in the prayers from the Magic Papyri we have translated. In these prayers, the Mind is presented as the Shepherd of Men and the Revealer of Light. Reitzenstein believes that the Christian writer took his description of the Shepherd from a more complete version of the "Poemandres" than the one we have, explaining certain unique features in Hermas. This older text was more closely aligned with the language of the popular Hermes religion, as seen in the Hermes-Prayers.

The connections between Hermas and the Trismegistic literature extend beyond just the "Poemandres" document.The original author of "Hermas" relied on "Hermes" for the introductory setting of his Pastoral apocalypses. Similarly, it is very likely that the editor was influenced by a lost treatise mentioned in the introduction of "The Sacred Sermon on the Mountain," C. H., xiii. (xiv.). This treatise refers to one of the now-lost "General Sermons," which also took place on a mountain.

In this context, Tat mentions climbing a mountain at the beginning of his novitiate when he became a "suppliant." He also notes that at this stage, the doctrine was not clearly explained but hidden in riddles because he was not yet purified and still influenced by worldly illusions. Interestingly, "Hermas" in the appendix (Sim. ix.) tells us that the Shepherd returned to him after the revelations and said that much had not been explained due to his "weakness in the flesh." Now, strengthened by the Spirit, the Shepherd will clarify everything. He then takes him to a "breast-like mountain" in Arcadia for further teachings. It's curious because Arcadia was known for the main Hellenic cult of Hermes, as stated by Lactantius, based on common Roman beliefs. According to a legend dating back at least to the second century B.C., Hermes set out from Arcadia to teach the Egyptians.

Additionally, "Hermas" contains many "Gnostic" elements throughout.As I wrote in my last book, it is essentially one of the many variations of the Sophia myth—a narrative about the mystical knowledge and love between Christ and Sophia, or Wisdom, the Son of God and His spouse or sister, the Holy Spirit, the King and Queen, the Lord and the Virgin Church. The most enlightening series of visions depict the allegorical drama of man's inner nature—the timeless mystery play. When we say "Gnostic," we also mean much of Hellenistic mysticism, and thus also "Hermetic" teachings, as the Trismegistic literature presents a simpler form of Gnosis than any Christian systems traditionally labeled "Gnostic."

THE VICES AND VIRTUES

A notable example of the similarity of these ideas can be seen by comparing the list of twelve vices and ten (seven and three) virtues in C. H., xiii. (xiv.) 7-10, with "Hermas," Sim. ix. 15, 1-3, where twelve "virgins," each representing a virtue, are contrasted with twelve "women in black," each representing a vice; and with "Hermas," Vis. iii. 8, 7, where seven women, each the mother of the next, are named after seven virtues. There is no need to assume direct contact between these texts, although it is interesting that the list of virtues appears in the sermon "On the Mountain." Both writers clearly share or are influenced by the same set of ideas, which are quite distinctive. These points shed interesting light on an element of the ancient Christian document whose exclusion from the canon, after having been nearly canonical for many years, is unfortunate.### The Early Date of the Original "Hermas"

The text known as "Apocalyptic Hermas" is clearly against the teachings of Paul, which likely led to its exclusion from the biblical canon. Consequently, it does not contain any quotes from Paul's letters. Even more notable is that neither "Apocalyptic Hermas" nor "Pastoral Hermas" quote from any of the Gospels, suggesting an early date of origin. If we accept the statement from the Muratorian Fragment (around 170 A.D.) that "Hermas" was written in Rome during the bishopric of Pius (140-155 A.D.), this likely refers to the final editor responsible for "Hermas iii.," who knew several canonical books. This implies that "Pastoral Hermas" can be dated back to the early first century. It is also important to remember—something Reitzenstein seems to have overlooked—that the original Greek version of "Hermas" is lost, as is the Old Latin version. We only have a Greek retranslation from Latin. Given these circumstances, it is surprising that there are still clear signs of literary influence from the original "Poemandres" introduction in our version of "Hermas."

### Use the Dependence Theory with Caution

In my opinion, it would be a serious mistake to overextend the theory of literary dependence. We should not try to explain the main content of "Hermas" solely through direct borrowing from other sources or by the external influence of the mystical and theological ideas of the time. There is no reason to dismiss the strong possibility that the original writer was documenting genuine inner experiences, even if these experiences were later expanded, edited, and refined by literary techniques, as was common in that era and others.It's true that personal experiences are often heavily influenced by the writer's prior beliefs, thoughts, and theological views, as well as by the common types of such experiences known in their time. It's rare to find records of visions or prophetic statements that aren't influenced in this way. A Buddhist seer interprets their visions through the lens of traditional Buddhist ideas; Greek prophets and sibyls envision an invisible world shaped by familiar myths, poets, and mystery traditions; an Egyptian prophet navigates the known landscape of their nation's Amenti; even Ezekiel uses symbols from Babylonian culture; and a Christian mystic envisions the conventional heaven for saints and hell for sinners.

Therefore, we don't need to follow Reitzenstein in detail when he argues that early Christian documents were strongly influenced by pagan mystical literature. He highlights strong parallels between the first four visions of "Hermas" and the visions of Zosimus, as found in the fragments of his "Acts," or the "Visit to Hades" of Setme and Si-Osiri, and their journey through the Seven Halls, as partially preserved in the Demotic "Tales of Khamuas."

Zosimus, who lived towards the end of the third century, was a member of the Poemandres community, making his visions particularly interesting. His visions were likely influenced by the Trismegistic tradition, especially the Isis-style literature and related Egyptian "Books of Hermes." However, the points Reitzenstein emphasizes seem too general to draw any direct conclusions about the relationship between "Hermas" and "Hermes."There is a certain similarity, but our information is too limited to draw any precise general conclusions. However, there is a valuable piece of information that prevents us from attributing all the similarities purely to the general thought atmosphere of the times. In one specific instance, we can be more definite. 

**The Visions of Crates**

Zosimus is not the only follower of Hermes Trismegistus whose visions are still recorded. Crates has also left an account of his mystical experiences, although it is unfortunately only available to us in an Arabic translation from the original Greek.

Crates describes leaving his body and entering the unseen world. "While I was praying," he writes, "I felt myself suddenly carried into the airs of heaven, following the same path as the sun and moon." Here, he meets Hermes Trismegistus, appearing as "an old man, the most beautiful of men, seated on a chair; he was clad in white clothing and held a book in his hand resting on the arm of the chair." 

This can be compared to "Hermas" (Vis. ii. 2, 2): "I see opposite me a chair, and on it a covering of wool white as hail; then came an old woman, in shining white clothes, holding a book, and sat down alone." After this revelation, and when the "old woman" had finished reading from the book, four young men came, carried off the chair, and took it to the East (ibid., 4, 1). It is also interesting to compare this with the introduction to a magical "light-ritual," where the seer has a vision of four men with crowns on their heads who bring in the "throne of the god."

Crates is taught from the book and instructed to write what he learns. "Make your book according to the instructions I have given; and know that I am with you and will never leave you until you have accomplished everything."Similarly, consider "Hermas." Compare the last sentence on page 382 with the phrase in the introduction to the "Pastoral Hermas": "I am sent... to dwell with you for the rest of your life." In another vision, Crates receives instructions through a dialogue that closely mirrors the style and content of our Trismegistic sermons. In yet another vision, he moves through a psychic reflection of the now largely lost Isis-type literature, which has a strong Egyptian influence. He is transported to another heaven and firmament, where he sees the temple of Ptah (Hephaestus) and the statue of Venus (Isis), which speaks to him. Clearly, he was deeply immersed in the Trismegistic tradition and had access to writings that are now unfortunately lost. This type of literature shows signs of direct Egyptian influence, and the mention of the temple of Ptah strongly supports Reitzenstein's analysis of the oldest part of the "Poemandres," which he links to the Ptah tradition.

The General Christian "Many" and the Gnostic "Few"

It is clear that the goal of the later Egyptian religion, and of all Hellenistic religious circles in general, was Gnosis, or a specific mystical experience through visions and apocalypses. This was also a major interest for many groups in the Early Church. This fact is crucial in studying Christian origins and should not be dismissed or minimized. It should be given top priority in trying to understand the many obscure issues of those early days that purely objective considerations cannot solve.The average Christian of modern times, just like in previous centuries, had much to learn from trained mystics, whether they shared the same faith or not. This isn't a criticism, as they were naturally among the many striving to become part of the few who were more spiritually advanced. However, as Christianity spread rapidly, the focused spiritual practices of early contemplatives were replaced by a fanatical enthusiasm for a misunderstood monastic lifestyle. This led to monasteries being overrun by many who lacked a true calling for the holy life and were often ignorant of the basics of contemplation. 

We need not delve into the extreme fanaticism of warrior monks who destroyed religious art across the Hellenic world, but even among the peaceful monks, there was much ignorance. An example of this is evident in a simple, genuine story that highlights their lack of knowledge. Some might argue that this has nothing to do with "Hermas," but it is crucial for understanding the development of general Christianity and its connection to the deeper religious consciousness of the early centuries. 

When I read the Greek text of this story, as presented by Reitzenstein, I realized that those who can't read Greek but are deeply interested in such matters might appreciate it in English. So, I have translated it. 

THE STORY OF ABBOT OLYMPIUS

The story goes as follows:

"Abbot Olympius said that one day a priest of the heathen Greeks came to Scetis. He visited my cell and spent the night there."Seeing the way the monks lived, he said to me: "Living like this, do you not have visions from your God?" "No," I answered. Then the priest said to me: "As long as we serve our God with holy deeds, He hides nothing from us and reveals His mysteries. But you, despite all your efforts—watching, keeping silence, disciplines—say you see nothing? If you see nothing, it must be because you have allowed evil thoughts into your hearts, which separate you from your God. This is why His mysteries are not revealed to you."

I went and told the elder monks what the priest had said, and they were astonished and agreed it was true. For impure thoughts do indeed separate man from God.

I do not fully understand what "logismous" means, which usually translates to "reasonings," and it seems to suggest that the monks' intellectual understanding was at fault. It could simply mean their "thoughts" were impure. But this is also unsatisfactory, because the monks must have already known to drive out impure thoughts. What is clear is that the "priest of the Greeks" had personal experience with these pious practices and came from a background where these were common. He knew why the monks failed in contemplation. He understood it all depended on thought, specifically "good thought," so that the "Good" might come to the "good," as the Hermes-Prayer says. He also knew the importance of "right thought," of Gnosis (knowledge) as well as faith, and the proper use of intelligence to dispel erroneous ideas about the nature of God.

A FINAL WORD

But for a final word on "Hermas." This early document was written in Rome; everyone agrees on that.It seems necessary to allow enough time for the older version of the "Poemandres" to spread widely before it could reach Rome from Egypt. This would not have been quick due to the emphasis on secrecy by the school that valued the "Poemandres." How could a Christian writer have obtained a copy, then? Was the secrecy pledge already lifted? This seems unlikely since later Trismegistic documents still emphasize secrecy.

Were early Christian mystical writers closely connected with the Poemandres community? Some Gnostics were; was the writer of "Hermas" one of them? Was there once friendship where there later was conflict? These and many other interesting questions arise, but satisfactory answers are unlikely until more work is done on the mystical religious environment of that time, which may hold key secrets to the Origins. In any case, it is possible to date the earlier "Poemandres" document back to the first century, making it at least contemporary with the earliest New Testament writings.

Consider the story from the Pistis Sophia where a spiritual double embraced and kissed Jesus as a boy, and they became one. This reflects the mystical belief in union with a spiritual presence and possession by a spirit, which Reitzenstein discusses at length in relation to Hermas.

In Pistis Sophia 120, there's a doubt whether it was a phantom tempting. Gebhardt and Harnack's edition (Leipzig, 1877) notes that the angelic shepherd is never mentioned in visions.

Erman quotes an inscription from Sakkara where a mystical shepherd says to his flock, "Your Shepherd is in the West with the fishes," which is interesting for those studying early Christian symbolism. This idea also has Babylonian roots, where star-flocks of the gods are fed beyond the ocean in the West.

Lastly, compare the Essenes' dress and the sending forth of the disciples in Matthew 10:9, Mark 6:8, and Luke 9:3. The contradiction between Mark's account and those in Matthew and Luke suggests that the one robe, staff, and wallet were typical signs of those sent to "raise the dead."He is dressed in the perizoma, a working garment (or apron) that men wore when they were said to work "naked" (nudus, gymnos)—which means wearing just one robe.

ABOUT THE AeON-DOCTRINE

"Listen then, my son, to how God and All are positioned: God; Aeon; Cosmos; Time; Becoming."--C. H., xi. (xii.) 1. THE SCOPE OF OUR ESSAY

While strictly avoiding the complex Christo-Gnostic aeonology, it may be helpful to provide a few notes on the simpler idea of the Aeon. This subject really needs a full treatise, but that would be too long for these introductory notes.

Let's first look at a striking passage that claims to give us the Orphic tradition of the Genesis of the World-Egg and its relation to the Aeon. This passage is very relevant to our current inquiry. Even if it isn't a direct quote from Apion, the Alexandrian scholar and critic of the Jews and Philo in the first half of the first century A.D., it represents the view of the Hellenistic theology of that period. This passage is found in the sources of the composite and overused document known as the Clementine Homilies, and it reads as follows:

THE ORPHIC TRADITION OF THE GENESIS OF THE WORLD-EGG

III. "There was a time when nothing existed except Chaos and an indistinguishable mixture of unordered elements, all jumbled together; both Nature herself and great thinkers believed it to be so."To illustrate my point, I will present the words of the wisest of the wise, Homer, who spoke about the original confusion:

"But may you all become water and earth"—

He meant that everything originates from water and earth, and after their dissolution, they return to their original state, which is Chaos.

Similarly, Hesiod in his Theogony says:

"In truth, Chaos came into being the very first."

By "came into being," he clearly means that Chaos was created like other things that can be created, not that it always existed like things that cannot be created.

Orpheus also compares Chaos to an Egg, containing the mixture of the primordial elements.

This is what Hesiod means by Chaos, and what Orpheus refers to as an Egg—a creatable entity, emerging from the infinite matter and brought into existence in this way.The fourfold Matter, being alive and the entire Infinitude seeming like a Depth (Bythos), was constantly flowing and moving indistinctly. It repeatedly produced countless imperfect mixtures of various kinds, which would then dissolve again due to its lack of order. These mixtures could not combine to create a living being. However, the infinite Sea, driven by its own nature, began to flow in an orderly manner, creating a vortex. This vortex blended the essences together, and the most developed part, suitable for generating life, flowed down the center of the universe and was carried to the bottom by the vortex, which pulled everything with it, including the surrounding Spirit. This process gathered everything into the most productive form, creating a distinct state.

Just like a bubble forms in water, a sphere-like hollow shape formed from all sides. Then, impregnated by the Divine Spirit that had united with it, it emerged into the Light. This event, perhaps the greatest ever conceived, was like a masterpiece born from the Infinite Depth's universe—an ensouled creation, shaped like the circumference of an egg and as swift as a wing.V. "Think of Cronus (Kronos) as Time and Rhea as the flow of Moist Essence. All of Matter, when moved in Time, produced an Egg, which is the entire spherical Heaven. In the beginning, this Egg was full of productive substance so that it could create elements and colors of all kinds. Despite the variety of appearances, everything came from One Essence and One Color. 

Just like a peacock's egg appears to have one color, but contains within it the potential for the bird’s many colors, the Ensouled Egg, conceived from Infinite Matter, shows various changes when it is set in motion by the flowing Matter below it. From within its circumference, a male-female Living Creature is formed by the Foreknowledge of the Divine Spirit within it. Orpheus calls this creature Manifestor (Phanes) because when it appears (faneis), the universe shines forth from it through the brilliance of Fire, the most glorious element, perfected in the Moist Element. 

This is not unbelievable, as Nature allows us to see a 'moist light' in glow-worms, for example.

VI. The First Egg ever produced, gradually warmed by the Living Creature inside it, eventually breaks open. Then, something similar to what Orpheus describes takes shape and emerges:

"When the skull-like wide-yawning Egg did break [etc.]."

By the power of Him who emerged and made Himself manifest, 'the shell' takes on structure and order. He presides as if on a throne on Heaven's height, sending His light all around upon the Boundless Aeon."COMMENTARY

This text is clearly referring to the Logos—the divine being born from the Egg and the Rock. The ancient Firmament was symbolized as a Rock, representing stability and strength, just as life in nature often begins in the mineral kingdom. The Logos resides in the highest heavens, in indescribable spaces, from where He sends His influence throughout the Aeon, which is the ultimate boundary encompassing all universes. While the Egg can be seen as the boundary of a specific universe or system, the Aeon represents the boundary of all universes. 

The information in this quotation claims to be the Orphic tradition of creation, which all Hellenistic theologians would be familiar with. Hence, it's not surprising to find similarities between this tradition and the ideas in the "Poemandres" cosmology. Although "Poemandres" has roots in Egyptian tradition, it has been heavily influenced by the mixed traditions of Plato, Pythagoras, and Orpheus. Both Plato and Pythagoras, on their mystical sides, are heavily influenced by Orphic ideas.

Orphicism was a revival of pre-Hesiodic Orphism initiated by Onomacritus under the Peisistratidae. The original Orphism, in my view, combined Hellenic Bardic lore with elements from Chaldean tradition. Therefore, it is not surprising that when the "Books of the Chaldaeans" were translated into Greek for the Alexandrian Library, they garnered significant interest from Hellenistic scholars. These scholars found confirmation of Orphic wisdom in these texts, not realizing that this wisdom partially originated from the same source.### The Sethian Gnosis

To illustrate this Chaldaic-Orphic symbolic creation story, adapted in a Hellenistic Gnostic context, we will refer to a system attributed to the Sethians by Hippolytus. This name suggests an Egyptian background, and Hippolytus closely links them to the Naassenes, whom he considers one of the earliest forms of Christian Gnosis. However, as we have shown, it is a pre-Christian Gnosis adapted into Christian terms around the mid-2nd century. Hippolytus describes the Sethians as follows:

"They believe there are three main principles of the universe, each with specific boundaries, yet each having limitless potential. These principles are Light and Darkness, with pure Spirit between them. 

"The Spirit, situated between the lower Darkness and the upper Light, is not like a gust of wind or breeze that can be felt; rather, it is like the delicate scent of perfume or incense, moving swiftly and beyond the power of words to describe.

"Light is above and Darkness below, with Spirit between them. The Light shines down like a sunbeam into the Darkness. The Spirit's fragrance, which occupies the middle position, spreads in all directions, just like incense smoke spreads when burned.

"The combined power of the Spirit and Light descends into the Darkness below them."The Darkness is an immense Water into which the Light and Spirit are drawn and transferred. However, the Darkness is not without intelligence; it understands that if Light were taken from it, it would remain isolated, unseen, and powerless.

Therefore, Darkness uses all its intelligence to hold onto the Light's brilliance and the Spirit's essence. One can see a reflection of this in a man's eye—the pupil, which is dark because of the underlying waters, yet illuminated by the Spirit.

As Darkness struggles to keep the Light and enslave it, the Light and Spirit strive to reclaim their power. They aim to raise and restore the powers intertwined with the dark Water below.

The countless powers of the three Principles are each wise and intelligent in their own essence. While they are at peace when alone, contact between different powers creates motion and energy, shaped by their interaction.

This interaction is like a seal imprinting its shape on substances it touches. Since the powers of the three Principles are infinite, their interactions produce endless images, like infinite seals.These images are the forms of different types of living creatures. From the initial powerful interactions of the three Principles, a significant seal was created—Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth have a configuration resembling a womb with an embryo in the middle. If someone wants to verify this, they should scientifically examine the pregnant womb of any living creature and they will see a model of Heaven and Earth and everything between them.

The configuration of Heaven and Earth was such that it resembled a womb, according to the first convergence of the three Principles. In the midst of Heaven and Earth, countless interactions of powers occurred, each creating and expressing an image like a seal of Heaven and Earth, resembling a womb. From the Earth itself, infinite forms of living creatures developed.

Into all this infinity below Heaven, the fragrance of the Spirit from above, along with the Light, was sown and distributed.

Out of the Water arose a first-born source—Wind, vehement and boisterous, which was the cause of all creation. By causing a certain seething in the waters, it raised up waves. The creation of the waves, acting like a pregnant impulse, is the source of the production of man or mind whenever this motion is quickened by the impulse of the Spirit.And whenever this wave, raised from the water by the wind, makes nature fertile, it absorbs the power of female production. It suppresses the light from above, which is mixed with the essence of the Spirit – that is, the mind that takes various forms. This mind is a perfect god, brought down from the Uncreated Light above and the Spirit into human nature, like a temple, through the course of Nature and the motion of the Wind, generated from Water, mixed with bodies, like salt in existing things and light in the Darkness, struggling to be freed from bodies, but unable to find liberation.

It is like a very small spark, a ray... 

Every concern of the Light above is about how mind can be liberated from the Death of the evil and dark Body, from the Father below, who is the Wind that raised the waves in chaos and brought forth perfect mind, his son, yet not of his own essence.

For the mind was a ray from above, from that Perfect Light, trapped in the sinuous, terrifying, bitter, and blood-stained Water; and that Light is the Spirit of Light borne upon the water.

But the Wind, being forceful and vehement in its rush, whistles like a Serpent – a winged one. From the Wind, or the Serpent, the source of generation arose, as mentioned; everything began to generate together.

When the Light and the Spirit are drawn into the impure and chaotic Womb of suffering, the Serpent – the Wind of the Darkness, the First-born of the Waters – enters and generates man. The impure Womb neither loves nor recognizes any other form.The Perfect Logos of the Light from above made Himself like the Beast, the Serpent, and entered the impure Womb by deceiving it through His resemblance to the Beast. This was to free the perfect mind trapped in the Womb's impurities by the First-born of the Water—Snake, Wind, Beast. 

This, he says, is the Servant's Form; and this is the reason for the Logos of God's descent into the Virgin's Womb. But it is not enough that the Perfect Man, the Logos, entered the Womb and freed the pains in that Darkness. After entering the Womb's foul mysteries, He cleansed Himself and drank the Cup of Living Water, which everyone must do to shed the Servant-Form and wear the Celestial Garment.

The main ideas behind this system of Gnosis are closely linked to general Orphic and Chaldaean ideas, as well as the main schematology of the "Poemandres" tractate. From the Orphic tradition passed down by Apion, we understand that the Aeon is the Circle of Infinity and Eternity illuminated by the Logos.

THE "MITHRAIC AEON"

The entire Orphic lore, or Chaldaean wisdom-teaching, seems to be encapsulated in one aspect of the Mithra-cult's symbolism. This is evident from the monuments reproduced by Cumont, especially those featuring the mysterious figure he calls "the lion-headed deity," and the God born from the Rock. This suggests a strong Chaldaean influence in the Mithraic tradition.Cumont tells us that although some scholars have rejected the name "Mithriac Aeon," given by Zoega to this mysterious figure, he believes it might have actually been called Aeon in the sacred texts of the mysteries. However, if this were true, the meaning was hidden from the uninitiated. Classical sources indicate that the Magi used various substitutes for the name of the Supreme God, which was considered ineffable. The general name for this Mystery Deity was Cronus, meaning Time. 

"The Mithriac Cronus is a personification of Time, and this fact, now fairly established, allows us to identify this pseudonymous God. There is only one Persian deity he could represent: Zervan Akarana, Infinite Time, whom a sect of the Magi, dating back to the Achemenides, believed to be the origin of all things, including Ormuzd and Ahriman. This God was placed at the top of the celestial hierarchy by the adepts of the mysteries and considered the first principle. In other words, it was the Zervanist system that the Mazdaeans of Asia Minor taught to the Western followers of the Iranian religion."

This suggests not a Persian origin of the Aeon, as Cumont believes, but rather a Chaldaean influence dominating the Mithriac form of the Magian tradition.

PROBABLE DATE OF ORIGIN OF THE HELLENISTIC DOCTRINE

The Chaldaean and Egyptian wisdom cultures shared many core ideas. Were they not regarded by the Greeks as the ultimate wisdom traditions?We are not surprised to find that Egypt, with its grandiose and mysterious expressions of vast time periods, like "He of the millions of years," had a well-developed concept of Eternity and Aeons. The Egyptian forms of Gnosticism, preserved with Christian influences, involve complex ideas about aeons. It seems that these Egyptian ideas were revived and saved from obscurity by Chaldaean ideas that entered Hellenistic circles in early Alexandrian times. It is hard to pinpoint exactly when the concept of Aeons became essential to Alexandrian philosophy, but it likely started in early Ptolemaic times and was certainly present by the first century B.C. and A.D.

The term Aeon was commonly used in the popular Hermes-cult. For example, in Hermes-Prayer v. 4, Thoth is described as the "Aeon of the Aeons who changes into all forms in visions." Similarly, in Prayer viii. 2, the Good Daimon, known by different names at different hours, is called the "Wealth-giving Aeon." Isis is also referred to as Wisdom and Aeon in the Papyri.

In conclusion, Reitzenstein discusses this "Aionenlehre" in detail. 

ABRAXAS

The name Abraxas, consisting of seven letters, was a mystical designation for a God who embodied the power of the Seven Planets and the Year of 365 days. The numerical value of the letters in Abraxas adds up to 365.This mysterious being was the "Year"; however, it was more than just the Year—it was Eternity, seen as a spirit or presence that spans from Heaven to Earth. This entity was the God who filled the Seven Spheres and the 365 Zones, the inner God referred to as "He who has His seat within the Seven Poles—AEEIOYU," according to ancient texts. The term "the Name of which the figure is 365" doesn't merely mean the "Year-God"; it is a synonym for the Highest God, a secret, mysterious being. Essentially, it was the Lion-headed God known in Greek as Aeon. Philo of Byblos indicates that, at least in the latter half of the first century A.D., there were communities in Phoenicia devoted to the Aeon—the Highest and Supercelestial One.

THE FEAST OF THE AEON

The first recorded religious use of the word "Aeon" is found in Messala (Consul in 53 B.C.), as Johannes Lydus tells us. Lydus also informs us that the Ancients celebrated a Feast of the Aeon on January 5th. This is the same Feast that Epiphanius describes in detail when discussing the Epiphany, particularly the festival in the Koreion at Alexandria:

"And if they are asked the meaning of this mystery, they answer and say: Today at this hour the Maiden (Kore), that is the Virgin, has given birth to the Aeon."

In the following paragraph, Epiphanius calls this Aeon the Only-begotten. This provides clear evidence that in its Egyptian context, the cult of the Aeon was linked to mystery rites that strongly resemble the symbolism of the Christ-mystery.**The Quintessence and the Monad**

Messala tells us that the Aeon, the entity who created and governs all things, united the nature and power of Water and Earth, which are heavy and tend to flow downwards, with those of Fire and Spirit, which are light and move upwards. This unification was achieved through the surrounding Heaven's mighty power, which harmonized these opposing forces. 

Lydus further explains that the Pythagoreans linked the concept of the Aeon with the Monad (the One). They believed the term 'Aeon' derived from 'ia,' the Ionic form of 'mia' (one). Although most scholars would reject the idea that the early Pythagoreans made this connection, I believe that the original Pythagoreans, who were close to the intersection of mythology and philosophy, personified or at least gave substance to their "Numbers" and their Source. It is also insightful to note that Plato wrote in the Timaeus:

**The Aeon in Plato**

"When the Father who created the Cosmos saw that it had become a likeness of the Everlasting Gods through its motion and life, He marveled and decided to make it even more like its Original. Since the Original is an Everlasting Living Being, He aimed to make the Sensible Universe as similar to it as possible. However, He could not bestow eternal nature entirely on a generable creature.

Thus, He decided to create a moving image of Eternity (Aeon). By organizing Heaven, He made it an everlasting image, moving according to number, of Eternity that remains in One—an image we call Time."

Here, it is evident that the Aeon is not Time but the model for Time—Eternity.**Regarding the Origin of Aeonology in Hellenistic Thought**

The concept of the Aeon, or the ultimate divine principle, is fully developed in Plato's works. Did Plato create this idea, or did he adapt it from earlier traditions? He likely encountered it from existing sources. Was it derived from Orphic or Pythagorean thought, or did he learn it in Egypt? The exact origin is uncertain.

**On the Hellenistic Origin of Aeonology**

Given that Plato's ideas were highly influential, especially for Hermetic writers, it is surprising that the Aeon concept appears as a new doctrine in Trismegistic literature at a certain point. Perhaps philosophers following Plato had previously ignored the Aeon, seeing it as an ultimate principle beyond human speculation. However, mystical thinkers, who ventured beyond conventional ideas, began to use the term Aeon to describe different levels of existence rather than a single transcendent unity.

It is possible that Hermetic writers reintroduced the term Aeon in its original philosophical sense to curb excessive speculation. Even if this was a reaction to overzealous mystical interpretations, it coincided with the development of aeonology. Consequently, the text C. H. xi. (xii.) should be considered from this perspective. While we can't pinpoint exactly when aeonology began, it was present in some form at least as early as the first Christian writings.

**The Aeon as the Logos**

Despite this, the Trismegistic tractate C. H., xi. (xii.)...The text is clearly influenced by the Timaeus, yet it claims to offer more "esoteric" or at least more detailed teachings than Plato's famous cosmological work. It doesn't follow Plato directly but rather presents an already established, precise doctrine. The hierarchy of existence is God, Aeon, Cosmos, Time, and Genesis, each descending from the previous one. Aeon is the Power of God, while Cosmos is God's creation and work. The Aeon, situated between God and Cosmos, is the Paradigm and also the Son of God, with the ultimate goal for humans to become Aeon—that is, the Son of God. Therefore, Aeon is clearly the Logos of God, or the Intelligible Cosmos, as opposed to the Sensible Cosmos.

This Aeon is the Fullness in which everything moves, especially the Seven Cosmoi.

THE ROMAN SAECULUM-CULT DERIVED FROM EGYPT

Reitzenstein shows that the Cult of the Saeculum or Aeon was highly developed in Roman theology by at least the first century B.C., too early to attribute this to the influence of the Mithras cult. Could Rome have been influenced by Egypt? Reitzenstein believes so, noting that Messala, who was deeply influenced by the Aeon idea, was a contemporary of Nigidius, a learned Roman and Pythagorean philosopher. Interestingly, Nigidius discusses the Egyptian Sphere in his work, De Sphaera Barbarica.

THE AEONIC IMMENSITIES OF EGYPT

Egypt, as previously mentioned, conceived the idea of eternal or very long periods of time early on and symbolized this concept with a primordial pair of Gods.Indeed, the names of the primordial Time-pair, Hhw (Hehu) and Hht (Hehut), come directly from "Hh," which is usually translated as "Million," but by Brugsch and others, as "Aeon." All the Egyptian Gods were Lords of Eternity or Eternities. However, the term "eternity" was also used for specific time periods; for example, "in a million (or eternity) of thirty-year periods." Additionally: "Your kingdom will have the duration of eternity and countless hundred-and-twenty-year periods; ten million of your years, millions of your months, hundreds of thousands of your days, ten thousands of your hours."

It is important to note the numbers 120 (which is 12 * 10) and 30, key numbers in the Gnostic Pleroma of Aeons. It's also interesting that Horapollo, the Alexandrian grammarian, mentions that when the Egyptians wanted to represent the idea of Aeon, they wrote "sun and moon," and for "year," they drew "Isis," meaning "woman." This shows that in Egypt, there were Aeons of Periods or Years and Years of Aeons. Above all these ruled the God of the Aeons, the highest God of many mystic communities.

A SONG OF PRAISE TO THE AeON

We find the following song of praise to the Aeon, inscribed on a "secret tablet" by an unknown Brother of a forgotten Order:

1. "Hail to Thee, O All-Cosmos of ethereal Spirit! Hail to Thee, O Spirit, who extends from Heaven to Earth, and from the Earth in the middle of the Cosmos to the ends of the Abyss!
2. "Hail to Thee, O Spirit who enters into me, who clings to me or parts from me, according to the Will of God in His goodness!
3. "Hail to Thee, O Beginning and End of Nature that nothing can move! Hail to thee, vortex of the liturgy unwearied by Nature's elements!Greetings to you, the Light of the Sun that shines to benefit the world. Greetings to you, the Disk of the Moon that shines unevenly! Greetings to all you Spirits of the divine statues!

Greetings to you all, whom holy Brothers and Sisters should praise!

O Spirit, mighty and incomprehensible Shape of the Universe, celestial, ethereal, inter-ethereal, water-like, earth-like, fire-like, air-like, like light and darkness, shining like the stars—moist, hot, cold Spirit!

I praise you, God of gods, who continually restores the Universe, and who stores the Depth away on its hidden throne, who separates Heaven and Earth, covers the Heaven with your golden everlasting wings, and makes the Earth firm on eternal foundations!

You who suspend the Aether in the lofty Height, and scatter the Air with your self-moving winds, who makes the Water swirl in circles!

O You who raise the fiery whirlwinds, and create thunder, lightning, rain, and earthquakes, O God of Ages! Mighty are you, Lord God, Master of All!

In this view, God is not separated into intra-cosmic and extra-cosmic; He is both. He is the entirety of the divine and also the entirety of the Universe. He is the Universe, and He is above and below the Universe.

THE CREATIVE AeON

Reitzenstein, referring to our Hermetic text, points out the distinction made between Aeon and God on one side and Aeon and the Universe on the other. He believes this shows the influence of a fundamental trait of Hellenistic theology, which makes the Demiurge the Second God.Certainly, here's a modernized and simplified version of the text:

There was definitely a difference made between the Creative God and the Supreme Deity in many Christian Gnostic systems, often in a way that diminished the former. Even in Jewish mystical and philosophical circles, a distinction had to be made between God as the Creator and God as the Ultimate Mystery. This was influenced by Jewish Gnostics' interactions with ancient wisdom and Greek philosophy.

In the eighth Book of Moses, there's a passage where the Jewish Creator God is ranked below the Egyptian Supreme Principle: "And God looked down on the earth and said: IAO! Everything became still, and from His Voice emerged a Great God, mighty and Lord of all things, bringing order to the aethereal realms."

Similarly, in a prayer to an unknown God, likely addressed to the Spirit by a member of the unknown community, we see the same distinction: "I invoke you, the only and blessed Father of the Aeons, with prayers like those offered to the Cosmos! Come to me, you who fill the whole Cosmos with your Breath, and hang the Fire above the Water, and separate the Earth from the Water. The Lord testified to your Wisdom, which is the Aeon, and commanded you to have strength as He does."Later, the Theurgist declares:

"Accept my words as if they were powerful flames, for I am God's chosen one, made from the purest elements of spirit, dew, and earth." This person speaks with authority, and his words make things happen, as they are potent and theurgic. Reitzenstein provides further examples (pp. 280-286) to illustrate that the idea of the Logos or Aeon as a Second God was a key concept in Hellenistic theology. While this may have been true in general Hellenistic theology, in philosophical circles, as seen in Philo's work on the Logos, the distinction was more formal than real. Similarly, in our Trismegistic writings, which are filled with transcendental pantheistic or monistic concepts, the Logos or Aeon may appear separate from the Supreme Deity momentarily, but in essence, they are not. The Logos represents God's eternal Energy, and the Aeon symbolizes God's eternal existence, the Rest that is the Source of all Motion. For a detailed explanation of the Aeon doctrine in our Trismegistic texts, refer to The Perfect Sermon, chapters 30-32, and my commentary on it.

THE SEVEN ZONES AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS

"To the first zone, he gives the energy of Growth and Decline; to the second zone, the Device of Evils now rendered powerless; to the third, the Guile of Desires made powerless; to the fourth, his Domineering Arrogance also made powerless; to the fifth, unholy Daring and the Rashness of Audacity made powerless; to the sixth, the Striving for Wealth by evil means deprived of its increase; and to the seventh zone, Ensnaring Falsehood made powerless."—C. H., i. 25.

MACROBIUS ON "THE DESCENT OF THE SOUL FROM THE HEIGHT OF THE COSMOS TO THE DEPTHS OF EARTH"

Let us first look at Macrobius' commentary on the famous "Dream of Scipio," which Cicero includes in his Republic (Book VI), similar to how Plato includes the Vision of Er in his works. Macrobius dedicates the twelfth chapter of his First Book to discussing "The Descent of the Soul from the Height of the Cosmos to the Depths of Earth," claiming to base his thoughts on Pythagorean and Platonic traditions. His discussion covers more than just the zones we are particularly interested in; however, since the entire concept is relevant to our current studies, we will include a translation of almost the entire chapter.

"[According to Pythagoras] when the Soul descends from the point where the Zodiac and Milky Way meet, from its spherical form, which is the only divine shape, it stretches into a conical form due to its downward movement.

---

This version retains the original meaning while making the text more accessible and easier to understand.Just as a line is created from a point and extends into length from an indivisible source, the soul originates from a single point, called a 'monad,' and then becomes a 'dyad'—its first extension. Plato, in his work Timaeus, explains that the World-Soul is both indivisible and divisible. Similarly, the soul of an individual man is indivisible in terms of its divine simplicity but divisible as it spreads through the parts of the world or a person.

When the soul connects with the body, it starts to experience physical disturbances as matter flows into it. Plato mentions in Phaedo that the soul is drawn to the body, reeling as if intoxicated—symbolizing the new influx of matter, which contaminates and burdens it, pulling it down.

This mystical idea is symbolized by the Starry Cup (Crater) of Father Bacchus, located between Cancer and Leo in the sky. This represents the initial intoxication of souls as they descend and matter enters them, leading to forgetfulness. If souls retained their divine memories when they entered the body, there would be no disagreements about the divine state among people. However, as they descend, they drink from the cup of forgetfulness to varying degrees. Thus, while not everyone sees the truth clearly, everyone has some opinion about it because opinions form as memories fade.Those who remember more easily what they knew before their souls were affected by matter are better discoverers of truth. The Latins call it a "lecture" (lectio) and the Greeks call it "re-knowing" (repetita cognitio) because when we speak of true things, we recognize what we knew naturally before our souls were clouded by matter in their descent into body.

This Matter (Hyle), after being shaped by divine ideas, formed every body in the visible cosmos. Its highest and purest form, which sustains the gods, is called Nectar and is believed to be the drink of the gods. The lower, murkier form is the drink of souls, known as the River of Lethe (Forgetfulness).

The Orphic initiates believe that Dionysus represents 'Hylic Nous'—the Mind that, after its birth from the Indivisible Mind, divides into individual minds. In their Mysteries, Dionysus is depicted as being torn apart by the Titans and then reassembled, symbolizing how the Mind, by dividing and then returning to its original state, fulfills cosmic duties and reveals its own nature.

The soul, after falling from the Zodiac and Galaxy due to this first weight of matter, continues its descent through lower spheres. During this descent, it not only becomes enveloped in a luminous body but also develops the individual motions it will use.In Saturn's sphere, the soul develops reasoning and theorizing abilities, known by the Greeks as "to logistikon" and "to theuretikon." In Jupiter's sphere, it gains the ability to put ideas into practice, called "to praktikon." In Mars' sphere, it acquires passionate intensity, termed "to thymikon." The Sun's sphere gives it the capacity for sensing and imagining, referred to as "to aisthetikon" and "to fantastikon." In Venus' sphere, it moves with desire, named "to epithymetikon." Mercury's sphere grants the ability to express and interpret feelings, known as "to erme neytikon." When entering the Moon's sphere, it activates "to fytikon"—the nature of growth and movement in bodies.

Although this soul is the last in the divine order, it is the first within us and all earthly beings, just as our body, despite being the lowest of divine things, is still the primary substance of the animal world. The difference between earthly and heavenly bodies lies in their direction: heavenly bodies are drawn upwards to the soul's abode, deserving eternal life due to their lofty nature, while the soul is drawn down to earthly bodies and is considered to "die" when trapped in the mortal realm. However, this frequent mention of death concerning the soul—which we assert is beyond death—should not cause distress.The soul is not destroyed by what we call its death; it is only hidden for a while. Its eternal blessing is not lost because it is submerged for a time. When the soul is completely cleansed of all its vices, it will return from the body to the light of Everlasting Life, restored and whole.

Macrobius describes the characteristics of the spheres based on their simple energies, without considering them as good or bad. It is the soul's thinking that determines whether these energies are used for good or evil purposes.

Servius, in his Commentary on Virgil's Aeneid, vi. 714, presents another tradition where the spheres are seen as harmful to the soul, attributing its evil tendencies to their energies. Some scholars believe that Virgil’s Sixth Book is influenced by popular Egyptian theology. Servius writes:

"Philosophers explain what the soul loses as it descends through the different spheres. This is why astrologers think that our body and soul are connected by the powers of these divinities. When souls descend, they bring with them Saturn’s sluggishness, Mars’s aggressiveness, Venus’s lustfulness, Mercury’s greed, and Jupiter’s desire for power. These traits disturb souls, preventing them from using their own energy and proper powers." 

It's important to note that the characteristics of the Sun and Moon are not mentioned, indicating a belief that they are distinct from the five other planets. Similarly, in the "Books of the Saviour" attached to the Pistis Sophia document, only five planets are mentioned.The tradition of this doctrine is very unclear and doesn't directly concern us, as our text is based on a "seven" system. 

CRITICISM OF THE EVIDENCE

I have tried to find a consistent way to reconcile the conflicting information from Macrobius, Servius, and Hermes, but organizing their data only makes things more confusing. However, it is clear that Macrobius, who attributes his ideas to the Orphic-Pythagorean-Platonic tradition, does not suggest that these philosophers believed the characteristics of the spheres were inherently evil. According to Macrobius, the tradition is as follows:

- Saturn: associated with intelligence and reasoning.
- Jupiter: associated with action and practical reasoning.
- Mars: associated with courage and spiritedness.
- Sun: associated with perception and imagination.
- Venus: associated with desire.
- Mercury: associated with expression and interpretation.
- Moon: associated with growth and physical action.

The confusion between Jupiter's "power of action" and the Moon's "power of action" might be resolved by assuming that Jupiter's power pertains to practical reasoning, while the Moon's power relates to physical movement, unless "et agendi" is a note added by Macrobius.

On the other hand, Servius follows a tradition where the spheres are seen as sources of evil tendencies, with ethical considerations dominating the concept. Since Servius's distribution is fivefold, it cannot be directly compared to Hermes's sevenfold doctrine, though there are some similarities. For example, Servius's concept of lust (libido) parallels Hermes's "guile of desires" or "lustful error" (epithymetike apate).Hermes attributes the third zone to Venus, and Servius also links Venus to the third zone, with Macrobius agreeing. Servius' "desire for rule" is the same as Hermes' "domineering arrogance," which Hermes places in the fourth zone and Servius associates with Jupiter, the ruler of the age. The previous ruler, Saturn, has lost his energy and become inactive. Servius' "wrathfulness" parallels Hermes' "unholy daring," placed in the fifth zone by Hermes and linked to Jupiter by Servius, with Mars also in the fifth zone according to Macrobius. Servius' "love of gain" matches Hermes' "striving for wealth by evil means," placed in the sixth zone by Hermes and linked to Mercury by Servius. Servius' "torpor," linked to Saturn, doesn't directly match anything in Hermes' scheme, unless we consider Hermes' "ensnaring falsehood" as related.

Hermes' system involves seven zones, representing the soul's ascent through seven layers from Earth's surface to the moon's orbit. This is not about the Celestial Spheres of the Philosophers, whose energies are neutral, nor about the "animal soul," as passions and desires are said to withdraw into a "nature devoid of reason."Although nothing more is mentioned about this nature here, it was generally believed at the time that its realm was below the earth's surface—a Tartarus with seven zones mirroring those above. In these zones, the "animal soul" or "vehicle of desire" was thought to gradually disintegrate, with its energies eventually returning to their source in the Depths of Darkness. This disintegration or transformation process was associated with experiencing punishments and horrors. However, the seven zones mentioned in our text seem to be areas where the lower energies of the human soul are purified; these are the mental energies misled by animal passions.

The "Ophite" Hebdomad

Turning to Salmon's article on the "Hebdomad," and his discussion on the traditions of the "Ophites"—a mysterious mix of chaotic elements rooted in diverse pre-Christian traditions and characterized by syncretic Gnosticism—he explains the Celestial Hebdomad and continues:

"Besides the higher hebdomad of the seven angels, the Ophite system also spoke of a lower hebdomad. After the serpent was punished for teaching our first parents to disobey the commands of Ialdabaoth, it was cast down into this lower world. There, it fathered six sons, forming a hebdomad that mirrors the one led by Ialdabaoth. These seven demons operate on this lower earth, not in the heavens, and take pleasure in harming the human race, for whom their father was punished. Origen (Adv. Cels., vi. 30) lists their names and forms from an Ophite Diagram: Michael as a lion, Suriel as an ox, Raphael as a dragon, Gabriel as an eagle, Thautabaoth as a bear, Erataoth as a dog, and Onoel as an ass."Here, I believe, we are uncovering one part of a broader mystery tradition that Hermes has "philosophized." I say one part because the "Ophite" tradition is not a single tradition but a mix of various traditions, including Chaldaean, Persian, and Egyptian elements, combined, or "centonized," with effort by Jewish scholars. 

THE SIMPLER FORM OF THE TRISMEGISTIC KNOWLEDGE

The elaborate symbolism and numerous mysterious figures in these systems of subjective imagery could only partially captivate a clear-thinking, philosophical mind trained in Plato's methods. If such a mind also had a mystical inclination, as was undoubtedly true for the writer of our "Poemandres" treatise, his main goal would be to simplify and categorize using philosophical terms, even if it meant losing some apocalyptic details. However, living among such ideas and being closely connected with various mystics and seers, he would inevitably be influenced by the core beliefs of these apocalyptic ideas and the common understanding of the Unseen World that all students of the time seemed to share. Thus, our Trismegistic literature, while dealing with Gnosis, approaches it in a much simpler way than any other known system of the time. Even so, the complex imagery of the Ophite schools is sometimes summarized in a few clear general symbols, likely representing their oldest elements.### Concerning Leviathan and Behemoth

From the unclear description by Origen of the famous but very puzzling Ophite Diagram that both Celsus and Origen had seen, although in different versions, we can only be sure of a few things.

This chart of the hidden realms was divided into three main sections: Upper, Middle, and Lower. The Middle section contained a geometric diagram with ten circles within one large circle. This large circle was called Leviathan, and the circles inside it seemed to be divided into groups of three and seven. The Lower section had a group of seven circles, representing the seven ruling demons—also known as Archontics—and this group was called Behemoth. 

Celsus, as quoted by Origen, tells us that the belief was that upon death, two groups of angels would gather around the soul. One group was called "Angels of Light" and the other "Archontics," which were essentially "Angels of Darkness." Therefore, it was thought that evil souls were taken by the demons to Behemoth, while pure souls were taken to Leviathan. We won't delve into the endless debates about these two Great Beasts, mentioned together in Job 40:15-24, and separately in Isaiah and Psalms. Recent research concludes that Leviathan was seen as the lord of the ocean, and Behemoth of the land.

However, in our diagram, Leviathan is the Lord of the Heaven-Ocean or Cosmic Air, and Behemoth is the Lord of the Cosmic Earth. In the Book of Enoch, the writer links these two monsters with the same end-of-world considerations that Origen says the Diagram represented. But while "Enoch" speaks of the Last Day, the Ophite writer refers to the soul's ascent after death.At the final separation of the Righteous and Unrighteous, the book of "Enoch" tells us that these Great Creatures, once united, will be parted. In other words, at death, the soul undergoes a transformation. From "Enoch," I infer that the Upper Space in the Ophite Diagram represents the Celestial Paradise, which symbolizes the state of the Pure Mind or the Righteous. In IV. Esdras vi. 49-52, Leviathan and Behemoth are depicted as Devourers of the Unrighteous. Jewish apocalyptic literature in both the Apocrypha and Talmud also suggests that these monsters will eventually become food for the Righteous in Messianic times.

From these clues, we deduce that Behemoth represents the Great Beast and Leviathan the Great Fish. The animal soul, when intensified by contact with the human mind, returns to its source, the Great Beast, where it is devoured and reabsorbed. Its energies then return to the collective energy of the Great Animal Group-Soul. Eventually, this entire energy and experience will become the "food" of the perfected man, who will transform these energies. The perfected man will thrive by converting the Body of the Great Beast into the Body of the Great Man. The Great Fish, however, symbolizes the higher energies of the soul, which also need transformation. To be born into the stature of the Great Man, the Son of Man must spend "three days" in the Belly of the Whale. This Great Fish symbolizes knowledge; for instance, in Assyrian Mystery-tradition, Oannes comes out of the Ocean in fish-form to teach. Similarly, the Ophite tradition suggests that the inspiration of the great prophets of Israel comes from the same Group of Angels that the Diagram calls Leviathan.It's interesting to note that Leviathan and Behemoth were once thought to be a single creature, later divided into male and female—Behemoth being male and Leviathan female. This resembles the ancient concept of Water-Earth from Hermes, which was split into Water and Earth, similar to how animals were originally male-female before being separated. In the Vision of Er, the paths of ascending and descending souls end in two openings in the sky and two in the earth, suggesting a large hollow ring divided into two, like two serpents with mouths and tails as openings. Interestingly, in the Pistis Sophia, the souls of the unrighteous enter through the mouth of the Lower Dragon and exit through its tail.

Since Leviathan is female and Behemoth male, together they form the circumference of the Great Wheel of Necessity, or the Wheel of Genesis. It's not surprising to attribute the nurturing of virtues to one and the processing of vices to the other. They could be seen as the right and left arcs or hemispheres of the Wheel, Sphere, or Egg, based on celestial geography. In Egyptian terrestrial symbolism, the right hand represented the north and the left the south, with upper and lower Egypt aligned accordingly. Curiously, in Isaiah 30:6, Behemoth is referred to as the monster of the "south land."

It's impossible to say if the author of the "Poemandres" was directly influenced by these specific traditions, but he was certainly influenced by the general symbolic ideas. It's likely he understood the esoteric meanings of the "hippopotamus" and "crocodile" symbols in Egyptian mysticism.According to the Ophites, after the soul moves past the animal-formed Rulers, it breaks through the "Fence of Iniquity" and turns towards higher realms. It must pass through these realms, and in the seventh and highest one, ruled by the Virtue Horaeus, the soul addresses the Ruler with a defense of its innocence, starting with: "O thou who hast transcended the 'Fence of Fire' without fear!" This Fence of Fire is depicted as a circle of fire with a flaming sword across its diameter, symbolizing the Sphere of Fire or the Guardian of the Gate. This had to be crossed before entering the Celestial Paradise, where the flashing blade guarded the "Tree of Gnosis and Life."

The same concept of a boundary or fence appears in the "Poemandres." Here, it is Man who breaks through the seven spheres and their enclosing Sphere, which is the Power that circumscribed the Fire. The core idea remains the same. However, Hermes' perspective, like that of the Ophite Gnostics, focuses on the Straight Ascent of the soul of an initiate, who breaks through the spheres, rather than the journey of the unregenerate souls through the Circle of Necessity as in the Vision of Er. This ascent represents a soul reaching the highest stage, the Hermes-stage or Thrice-greatest grade, achieving freedom after its final compulsory birth.

PLATO: CONCERNING REINCARNATION

"And the soul's flaw is ignorance."The soul that lacks knowledge of existence, its nature, or the concept of Good is overwhelmed by bodily passions and is constantly unsettled. This unfortunate soul, unaware of its true self, becomes enslaved to external bodies, carrying the body as a burden rather than ruling over it.

To better understand this passage, it's helpful to recall Plato's doctrine of the transmigration of souls from the "Phaedrus." We will use Stewart's English translation as a basis but will clarify it for better comprehension.

THE SOUL AND ITS MYSTERIES IN THE "PHAEDRUS"

"This is the life of the Gods. Among other souls, those that best follow God and resemble Him most, keep their charioteer's head lifted beyond the heavens. They are carried around the circuit but are still troubled by the horses, struggling to see the true nature of things. These souls are sometimes lifted up and sometimes pulled down, seeing some truths but missing others due to the horses' influence.

The other souls strive to reach the divine but fail, getting carried around and sinking below it. They trample and collide with each other, trying to outdo one another, creating a great noise and struggle. Due to the inexperience of the charioteers, many souls are injured, losing their feathers and leaving without having seen the true nature of existence. These souls then turn to the realm of opinion for sustenance."Here's a modern English version of the text, simplified and corrected without altering its original meaning:

This is why there is such a strong desire to see the Place where the Plain of Truth is located. The best part of the soul thrives in the meadow there, and the power of the wings, which allows the soul to ascend, is nourished by it. According to the law of Adrasteia, any soul that follows God and sees the truth will be free from suffering until its next journey. If it continues to do this consistently, it will always be unharmed.

However, when the soul cannot follow God and fails to see the truth, and is instead filled with forgetfulness and wickedness due to some misfortune, it becomes weighed down, loses its feathers, and falls to Earth. The law states that such a soul is not to be placed in the body of a beast for its first birth. Instead, the soul that has seen the most truth will be born into a person who loves wisdom, beauty, or the Muses. The soul that has seen slightly less truth will be born into a king who loves law, a warrior, or a true ruler. The soul that has seen even less will be born into someone involved in civic duties, administration, or business. The soul that has seen fourth most truth will become a person dedicated to physical discipline or healing. The fifth soul will be born into someone involved with oracles or mystic rituals. The sixth soul will become a poet or an imitator. The seventh soul will become a craftsman or farmer. The eighth will become a sophist or a demagogue. The ninth will become a tyrant.

In all these lives, those who live righteously will have a better fate, while those who live unrighteously will have a worse one.A Soul does not return to the same state from which it came for about ten thousand years. Before this period, no Soul regains its wings, except for the Soul that has loved wisdom either naturally or against the odds.

Such Souls, if they have chosen the life of wisdom three times in succession, regain their wings in the third thousand-year period and depart in the three thousandth year.

Other Souls, after completing their first life, are judged. Some go to places of correction beneath the Earth to pay their penalties, while others are rewarded by ascending to a certain place in Heaven, living in a state fitting the life they lived as humans. In the thousandth year, both groups come to choose their next life in a lottery.

A Soul that once lived as a human might be reborn as an animal, and a Soul that was once an animal might become human again. A Soul that has never seen truth can never attain this form.

We must understand "man" as a form created from many sensations, unified by reasoning. This process is a recollection of the things our Soul once saw when it journeyed with God, looking beyond what we now call reality to perceive true existence.

Therefore, the understanding of the wisdom-lover gains wings, as he is always engaged with these memories. By engaging with such divine things, he becomes divine. The person who makes the right use of these memories, continually reaching perfect understanding, alone becomes truly perfect."But because he avoids the things people usually pursue and focuses only on the divine, many people think he is crazy because they can't understand that he is inspired by God." — Plotinus on Metempsychosis

Let's now turn to the true followers of the master for more insight on this belief, starting with Plotinus. Jules Simon's "Histoire de l'Ecole d'Alexandrie" (Paris, 1845), volume 1, page 588 and onwards, provides the most sympathetic account of this belief in Plotinus, primarily based on Enneads I. i. 12; II. ix. 6; IV. iii. 9; V. ii. 2; and Ficinus' Commentary (page 508 of Creuzer's edition). After mentioning some "ironic" passages from Plotinus (where the philosopher veiled the real doctrine that was still part of higher teachings of his time), Jules Simon continues:

"Even if we accept that Plotinus takes the doctrine of metempsychosis literally, we should still question, as with Plato, whether the human soul actually inhabits the body of an animal or whether it is only reborn into a human body that reflects the nature of a certain animal through its passions. The commentators of the Alexandrian school sometimes interpreted Plato in this way. For example, according to Proclus, Plato in the Phaedrus condemns the wicked to live like animals but not to become animals (Proclus, Commentary on Timaeus, page 329). Chalcidius offers the same interpretation, distinguishing between the teachings of Plato and those of Pythagoras and Empedocles, who believed not only in the nature but also in the forms of animals. Hermes (Commentary of Chalcidius on Timaeus; edited by Fabricius, page 350) clearly states that a human soul can never return to the body of an animal and that the will of the Gods always prevents such a disgrace."**Proclus on the Descent of Souls into Animals**

Proclus, in his commentaries on Plato's *Timaeus*, discusses the transformation of souls into animals. He refers to a passage from Plato:

"If a person continues to be wicked, they will transform into an animal that reflects their immoral behavior."

Proclus explains:

"People often question how this transformation of souls into animals should be understood. Some believe that 'animal-like' lives are metaphorical, suggesting that humans cannot actually become animal souls. Others think that human souls can indeed be degraded into animal forms, as all souls share the same nature and can thus become wolves, panthers, or other animals.

However, the true explanation is that while a human soul can degrade to an animal-like existence, it is only to animals whose life fits this purpose. The degraded soul is connected to this animal life sympathetically. This concept has been extensively discussed in our lectures on Plato's *Phaedrus*. This is the only way such degradation can occur.

Furthermore, in Plato's *Republic*, it is stated that the soul of Thersites became like an ape in life, not in body. Similarly, in the *Phaedrus*, it is said that the soul descends into an animal-like life, not an animal body, because the type of life matches the soul. In the *Timaeus* passage, 'brute-like nature' refers to the life principle of the animal, not its physical body."The Myths of Plato (London, 1905), pp. 313 ff.; see also Jowett (Oxford, 1892), i. 454 ff.; and Taylor (London, 1804), iii. 325 ff.

This is why Plato uses these numbers as symbols for the soul's purification and restoration to its true perfection and happiness.

"To the mindless, wicked, depraved, envious, and covetous, as well as those who commit murder and love impiety, I remain distant, leaving them to face the Avenging Daimon."—C. H., ff., i. 23.

#### Er, Son of Armenius

At death, a person's "way of life" is handed over to this Daimon (section 24). We can relate this to the story or vision of "Er, Son of Armenius," as told by Plato in the final book (X.) of his Republic (614 B ff.). The symbolism in this story is quite similar to our text, and the subject matter overlaps significantly. According to Clement of Alexandria, this Er was said to be Zoroaster. However, there is no evidence of Plato referring to Zoroaster in his other writings, and there is no reason to call this character Er the Pamphylian. The philosophy of Heraclitus cannot be traced back to Zoroaster, and Plato's myths even less so.

The origin of this story remains unknown, with most scholars believing it to be a creation of Plato.

This tale is about a man "killed in battle," whose body was brought home on the tenth day, still fresh and showing no signs of decay. On the twelfth day, as his body was placed on the funeral pyre, Er revived and recounted his extraordinary experiences in the afterlife. This story should be closely compared with Plutarch's similar but more detailed Vision of Aridaeus (Thespesius), which I have extensively commented on in my "Notes on the Eleusinian Mysteries."In my previous discussion, I mentioned that the experiences of Aridaeus might either be a clever way to describe teachings from certain Mysteries or that the story, presented as a popular tale, accurately depicted beliefs about the invisible world and after-death conditions of the soul, requiring minimal changes to serve this purpose. I now propose that Plato's Story of Er serves a similar function. It's also worth noting that in the Vision of Er, a character named Ardiaeus appears, whereas Plutarch's main character is named Aridaeus. The difference of a single letter makes the names nearly identical, and the subject matter is so similar that there seems to be a connection between the two visions. Additionally, Aridaeus is said to be from Soli in Cilicia, while Er is described as a Pamphylian. This suggests that these stories might have originated from Asia Minor, a region known for blending Western and Eastern influences. However, it is more likely that in the Story of Er, Plato is conveying Orphic eschatological doctrines. Whether the story existed in some form before Plato and was then refined by him remains uncertain. Now, let's turn to the story itself.

THE CYLINDER

614 C.—Er, on a certain spiritual or psychic plane (referred to as topos tis daimonios), observes a pivotal moment or transformation in the journey of souls ascending and descending. It seems he was in a space or state between Tartarus and Heaven, presumably in the invisible part of the sublunary space.The world-engine of Fate, or Karmic World-whorl, is represented by seven spheres surrounded by an eighth. These spheres are harmoniously spun by the three Fates, the Daughters of Necessity. Jowett mentions that the heaven-sphere is symbolized by a "cylinder or box." However, the term "cylinder" is not found in the text, and the idea of a cylinder is hard to pinpoint. It is debatable whether the heaven-sphere should be interpreted this way, as it would complicate the discussion of the term "cylinder," which appears clearly in our K. K. Fragments. The issue is complex, and Jowett's explanations are unclear and incomplete. Either Plato is being nonsensical, or Jowett does not grasp the basics of his idea. Stewart's attempt, using the latest Platonic research, is more successful, but he also struggles with some points. The difficulty of solving this problem is evident from the text, which describes the vision of the spheres as follows:

THE VISION

"After those in the meadow had stayed for seven days, on the eighth day, they had to continue their journey upwards. Four days later, Er said they reached a place where they saw light stretching straight as a column from above, spanning heaven and earth, and it looked like a brighter, purer rainbow. 

"After another day of travel, they reached the light and saw the boundaries of heaven extended within it. This light marked the edge of heaven, similar to the underpinnings of ships, and enclosed its entire revolution. 

"From these boundaries hung the spindle of Necessity, which controlled all its revolutions."The spindle's shaft and its hook are made of adamant, and the whorl is a mixture of adamant and other materials.

"The nature of the whorl is as follows: It was shaped like the one we see here, but according to the description, it consisted of one large hollow whorl containing a smaller one inside it, similar to nested jars. There were a total of eight whorls nested within each other, appearing as circles from above, but forming a continuous shape around the shaft, which passed through all eight whorls.

"The first and outermost whorl had the widest rim; the sixth had the second widest; the fourth was third; the eighth was fourth; the seventh was fifth; the fifth was sixth; the third was seventh; and the second was the narrowest. 

"The largest circle was multicolored; the seventh was the brightest; the eighth reflected the seventh's light; the second and fifth were similar in color but more yellowish; the third was the whitest; the fourth was reddish; and the sixth was the second whitest.

"The entire spindle rotated at the same speed, while the seven inner circles rotated slowly in the opposite direction. Of these, the eighth moved the fastest; the seventh, sixth, and fifth moved at the same rate, coming second in speed; the fourth moved in a reversed orbit and was third in speed; the third was fourth in speed, and the second was the slowest."The spindle spun on Necessity's knees. Each circle around it had a Siren, singing a single note, and together they created a harmonious melody. Three others, the Fates—Lachesis, Clotho, and Atropos—sat on thrones in white robes with garlands, singing along: Lachesis sang of the past, Clotho of the present, and Atropos of the future.

Clotho occasionally gave an extra spin to the outer circle, Atropos to the inner ones, and Lachesis touched them both. When Er and the souls arrived, they went directly to Lachesis. A prophet organized them, took lots and life samples from Lachesis' lap, stood on a raised platform, and announced:

"Listen to the word of Virgin Lachesis, Daughter of Necessity! Souls, this is the beginning of a new mortal life that brings death. You will choose your own destiny, not the other way around. The first to choose will have to stick with their choice. Virtue is not controlled by Necessity; everyone will have more or less of it depending on how they honor it. The chooser is responsible; God is blameless."

He then threw the lots to everyone except Er, who wasn’t allowed to pick. Each soul who picked a lot knew their order.After this, he placed samples of different lives on the ground before them, far more than the people present. They included every kind of life: not only those of various animals but also various types of human lives. Among them were lives of autocratic power, some lasting until the end, while others ended halfway in poverty, exile, and beggary. There were lives of famous people, some known for their beauty, strength, and victories in games, others for their noble birth and the virtues of their ancestors; others were infamous for similar reasons. The same applied to the lives of women.

Regarding the rank of the soul, it was no longer within the chooser's power, for the decree of Necessity dictated that choosing a particular life affected the soul's rank. Other factors, like wealth and poverty, were mixed in, sometimes with disease or health, or somewhere in between.

Plato then discusses the best choice and how a person should carry an unwavering belief in truth and righteousness into the world. He continues:

"And this is precisely what the messenger from the invisible world reported the prophet said:

'Even for the one who chooses last, if he chooses wisely and lives consistently, there is a desirable life far from evil. So let neither the one who has the best choice be careless, nor the one who chooses last despair.'

After these words, the one who had the first choice, Er, immediately selected the largest life of autocratic power. However, due to folly and greed, he did not choose carefully and failed to notice the fate that came with it, including horrible consequences like 'dishes of his own children' and other misfortunes."After examining it at his own pace, he began to regret his decision, beating his chest and lamenting his choice, despite the prophet's earlier warning. Instead of blaming himself for his misfortune, he blamed bad luck, spirits, and anything but himself. He was one of those who had come from heaven, having lived a virtuous life by habit rather than by a love of wisdom.

In short, it was not uncommon for those who made poor choices to come from heaven, as they were unaccustomed to life's hardships. Many who came from earth, having experienced and witnessed suffering, made more thoughtful decisions.

As a result, many souls, regardless of their initial fortune, exchanged good for evil and vice versa. If a person consistently lived a philosophical life on earth and was not among the last to choose their lot, they were likely to live happily and have a smooth journey between this world and the next, rather than a difficult one.

Er said that the vision he saw was remarkable, revealing how different souls chose their lives. It was both pitiful and laughable, as well as wonderful to see. Most chose based on their previous experiences. Er saw the soul of Orpheus choose the life of a swan because of his hatred for women, stemming from his death at their hands. Similarly, he saw the soul of Thamyras choose the life of a nightingale.On the contrary, he also saw a swan transform into a human life, and other musical animals do the same. The soul that got the twentieth pick chose the life of a lion; it was the soul of Ajax, son of Telamon, who wanted to avoid being a man because he still remembered the unfair decision about the armor. The next soul was Agamemnon's; out of hatred for the human race due to his sufferings, he chose the life of an eagle. 

The soul of Atalanta got a middle pick and, attracted by the great honors given to athletes, couldn't resist and chose that life. The soul of Epeius, son of Panopeus, transformed into a woman skilled in the arts. And far among the last, he saw the soul of the buffoon Thersites becoming an ape.

By a stroke of luck, he saw the soul of Odysseus, which had the last pick, come to make its choice. Remembering its past labors, it sought peace and avoided fame, looking for the life of a private man with no public duties. With great difficulty, it found such a life neglected in a corner and chose it, saying it would have chosen the same even if it had the first pick.

Er said that other animals also transformed in various ways, with some becoming humans and others changing among different animals. The unrighteous ones turned into wild beasts, and the righteous into tame ones, with all sorts of intermixing.

When all the souls had chosen their lives according to their turn, they went to Lachesis. She assigned each soul a guardian spirit to oversee their life and help fulfill their chosen destiny.And the spirit first brought the soul to Clotho, placed it under her hand and the spinning wheel, thus confirming the fate each soul had chosen. After this, he took it to Atropos, making its destiny irreversible. 

Er then went straight down beneath the Throne of Necessity. After passing through, he and the others arrived at the Plain of Forgetfulness (Lethe), which was unbearably hot and barren. They camped by the River Heedlessness, whose water no container can hold. Everyone was forced to drink a certain amount of this water; those lacking wisdom drank more and forgot everything. 

At midnight, after they had fallen asleep, there was thunder and an earthquake, and suddenly they were carried up into birth, each in a different direction like shooting stars. Er, however, did not drink the water and could not explain how he returned to his body. He just suddenly woke up in the morning and found himself lying on the funeral pyre.

COMMENTARY

One might wonder: Did Plato end his grand work on the Ideal State with a popular legend as a joke, or was there a deeper purpose? I believe he was seriously jesting. Is it too far-fetched to think he was hinting at things he couldn't reveal due to an oath? Those in the know would understand, while others would see it as a simple joke, keeping the mysteries hidden. In any case, it seems we've been given a glimpse of the role the spirit plays in our discussion.Whether Hermes copied the idea from Plato, or both got it from the same tradition, is up to individual scholars to decide. The Daimon watches over a person's way of life (Ethos); it is not necessarily evil but acts as the Karmic Agent of the soul, executing the soul's choices, whether good or bad, according to the Law of Necessity. The choice belongs to man; Nature balances it out. The Vision is typical and represented by well-known characters in Greek mythology. The "way of life" chosen by souls becomes their "habit," their personality, or karmic limitation. Some souls, instead of reincarnating as humans, choose to live as certain animals. 

Should we believe that Plato seriously supported the idea of reincarnation into animals? Or is he referring to a state of existence for souls symbolized by animals in the Mysteries, like the "lion" and "eagle," though not the "swan," "nightingale," or "ape"? Could Plato be using his imagination, based on ideas he might have learned in Egypt? From the "Diagram of the Ophites," mentioned in Origen's critique of Celsus, we know the "seven spheres" of the lower psychic nature were symbolized by animals: lion, bull, serpent, eagle, bear, dog, and ass. We also know how the concept of animal correspondences was significant to the Egyptian priesthood.We can't make a clear plan from the incomplete hints we've received, and we're quite certain that if Plutarch's account of the later Egyptians' beliefs is somewhat accurate, even the priests back then didn't have a consistent understanding. Therefore, we can either conclude that the whole matter was a baseless superstition or that there was once a psychic science about animal natures and their relationship to humans, known to the ancient Egyptian priesthood, which got lost because those who understood it disappeared. Only fragments of misunderstood traditions remained among the common people. This is the theory presented in our Trismegistic treatises.I haven't yet found any commentator who explains how the statements about "width of rim" and colors fit with the rates of motions and numbers given in Tim. 36. Since Er is said to have seen this mystery from a realm beyond even the daimonian region, it might be inappropriate to insist on a purely physical interpretation of the data.

CONCERNING THE CUP

"He filled a mighty Cup with Mind and sent it down, along with a Herald, to whom He gave the command to make this proclamation to the hearts of men: Baptize thyself with this Cup's baptism," etc.--C. H., iv. (v.) 4. THE CUP IN PLATO

Where did the idea of a Cup come from in our Trismegistic literature? Most scholars will immediately say: From Plato. The Cup was what the Creator used to mix the Elements of the World-Soul. In Timaeus (41 D), Plato talks about the creation of human souls:

"He spoke, and once again into the Cup which He had used in blending and mingling the Soul of the Universe, He poured the remains of the Elements He had used, and mixed them similarly; they were not, however, as pure as before, but in the second and third degree." I do not believe this symbolic expression simply originated from Plato's poetic mind. Instead, I think Plato was using a familiar figure of "Orphic" symbolism. The idea of not only an Ultimate Cup but also many subsidiary ones in the celestial and invisible realms is closely connected with the "Orphic" idea of a Vortex.

IN "ORPHEUS," MACROBIUS, AND PROCLUS

Orpheus is said to have called the Aether the Mighty Whirlpool. This forms the Egg or Womb of the Cosmos; it is a modification of Chaos or Rhea, the Eternally-flowing, the Mother of the Gods, the Great Container. Proclus, in speaking of Chaos, says:

"The last Infinity, by which Matter is circumscribed, is the Container, the field and plane of ideas. Around her is 'neither limit, nor foundation, nor seat, but excessive Darkness.'"Plato, in his discussion of the origin of the soul, describes a Cup or Crater in two ways: the Deity uses it to mix the All-Soul of the universe from the purest cosmic elements and also to create human souls from a less pure mixture of these elements. Macrobius notes that Plato also indirectly refers to this Cup in the Phaedo, where he explains that the soul is drawn back to the body, driven by a new desire to experience material existence again. This process is symbolized by the astral Crater of Father Liber (Dionysus, Bacchus), which the Ancients called the River of Lethe. The Orphics believed that Father Liber represented the material mind.

Thus, there are higher and lower Cups. Proclus mentions several such Craters, stating that Plato refers to the Vulcanic Crater in the Philebus and that Orpheus knows of Dionysus's Cup and places many such Cups around the Solar Table.

Proclus also mentions that the Demiurge creates psychic essences with the Crater, which is the source of souls. This Crater, filled by the Demiurge, then fills the souls and is called the Fountain of Souls.

From these descriptions, we can infer that, according to Orphic, Pythagorean, Platonic, and Hermetic traditions, the "matter" of each "plane" originates from such a Crater or Cup, moving from a more subtle and simple state to a more gross and complex one, and vice versa.In simpler terms, the Crater represents the fundamental or "atomic" state of matter in any phase or state of existence. 

THE VISION OF ARIDAEUS

With this information in mind, it is also helpful to look at the Vision of Aridaeus (Thespesius), as described by Plutarch. This vision can be compared to the Vision of Er told by Plato. Thespesius is guided through Hades, the Invisible World connected to earthly life, by a relative who has passed away. Interestingly, he encounters a Chasm and a Crater. The story goes:

"After these explanations, his relative guided him quickly across a vast space, smoothly and directly, as if supported by wings of light. When they reached a large vortex extending downward, the power supporting him left him. He noticed the same thing happened to the other souls there; like birds, they stopped their flight and circled around the vortex, afraid to go straight through it. Inside, it looked like Bacchic caves decorated with trees and greenery, and a gentle, sweet-smelling air came out, like a blend of wine for drinkers. The souls, delighted by the fragrance, embraced each other in joy, while the whole place was filled with revelry, laughter, and the spirit of fun and pleasure.

"Thespesius' relative told him that this was the path Dionysus took to ascend to the Gods and later brought up Semele. It was called the Place of Lethe (Oblivion)."Thespesius wanted to stay, but he was forcefully taken away. It was explained to him that pleasure affects the rational part of the soul, making it weak, while the irrational and physical part becomes stronger and remembers the body. This memory leads to desire, pulling the soul down, weighed down by physical urges.

After traveling further, Thespesius saw a huge Cup with streams flowing into it. One stream was whiter than sea foam or snow, another was purple like a rainbow, and others had different colors, each unique. As he got closer, the Cup and its surroundings lost their colors, leaving only a bright white glow.

In a related text, the Greek theologians refer to the Logos as the "Heavenly Horn of Men," because he mixes all things. A Jewish Gnostic writer comments that this is the Drinking Vessel, the Cup the King drinks and divines from. Another Hellenist commentator describes it as the Cup of Anacreon that expresses the Ineffable Mystery silently.

This shows that the Cup symbol was used similarly in the first century B.C., attributed more to Greek theologians (the Orphics) rather than to Plato.### The Origin of the Symbol in Orphic Tradition

Given the information we have, it's easy to see that the idea of the Cup or Mixing-Bowl wasn't something Plato invented. When he uses this symbol, he's actually using an image that his audience already knew well. This is clear from the way he briefly introduces the figure. So, the symbol was a common part of the Orphic tradition and familiar to every Pythagorean. In our text, it's noteworthy that this Cup-symbol is equated with the Monad or Oneness—a technical term in Pythagorean philosophy.

10. Refers to the mysteries of birth and the indestructibility of life. Semele, mother of Dionysus (son of Zeus, representing Creative Power), was killed by Zeus's power but later revived among the gods by her son's power. In reincarnation, part of the soul "dies" as it gives birth to itself in this world.The child born may eventually become the savior of his mother, who has now become his spouse, and elevate her, who is also himself, to a higher state. Compare this to Pistis Sophia (336, 337), which describes how certain karmic forces give the old soul, before reincarnation, a Draught of Oblivion made from the Seed of Iniquity, filled with all kinds of desires and forgetfulness. When the soul drinks this Draught, it forgets all the places it has traveled and the punishments it has endured. This Draught becomes an external body to the soul, mirroring it perfectly, and is known as the "counterfeit spirit." In contrast, for the purified soul, a higher power provides a Cup full of intuition, wisdom, and prudence, placing the soul into a body that cannot sleep or forget because of the Cup of Prudence. This soul remains pure in heart, always seeking the Mysteries of Light, until it finds them and inherits the Light forever, as ordered by the Virgin of Light.

Compare this to the "Moist Essence" mentioned in Corpus Hermeticum, i. 4, and iii. (iv.) 1. It is interesting that one of the apocryphal Books of Moses was called The Monad, and another The Key, suggesting an early and widespread recognition of these two treatises. See R. 182, note 3.

THE FOLLOWERS OF HERMES TRISMEGISTUS

PTAH, SEKHET, AND IMHOTEP (ASCLEPIUS)

Budge, in his book "Gods of the Egyptians" (vol. i. ch. xvi.), explains that the Great Triad of Memphis included Ptah, Sekhet, and Imhotep.Ptah was known as the "Sculptor or Engraver" and the foremost creator. He is referred to as the "Very Great God who came into being in the earliest time"; "Father of fathers, Power of powers"; "Father of beginnings and Creator of the Eggs of the Sun and Moon"; "Lord of Truth, King of the Two Lands, the God of the Beautiful Face... who created His own Image, who fashioned His own Body, who established Truth throughout the Two Lands"; "Ptah the Disk of Heaven, Illuminator of the Two Lands with the Fire of His Two Eyes." Ptah's "Workshop" was the unseen world. He executed the creation commands given by Thoth. Ptah's female counterpart was Sekhet, who was both his sister and wife, and the mother of their son Nefer-Tem. She was also related to the Goddess Bast. Sekhet is called: "Greatly Beloved One of Ptah, Lady of Heaven, Mistress of the Two Lands"; and is often named "Nesert," meaning "Flame."

Thoth, along with his Seven Wise Ones, planned the world. Ptah acts on the commands of Thoth and his Seven Wise Ones, while Thoth represents Ptah's intelligence. This connection makes Sekhet identified with Maat, Thoth's inseparable spouse.

The third member of the Memphite Triad is Nefer-Tem, or the "Young Tem." In the Ritual, chapter lxxxi., version B, it says: "Hail, thou Lotus, symbol of the God Nefer-Tem! I am one who knows you, and I know your name among the Gods, the Lords of the Underworld, and I am one of you." In chapter clxxiv. 19, Nefer-Tem is compared to "the Lotus at the nostrils of Ra"; and in chapter clxxviii. 36, he holds the same title. In later texts, Nefer-Tem is identified with many Gods, all forms of Horus or Thoth.We are now exploring the Ptah tradition of Memphis, which played a significant role in the cosmogenesis of the "Poemandres" tractate. In this tradition, Thoth and Ptah, as well as Maat and Sekhet, are both identified with each other and distinguished from each other. The offspring of these powers is the Young Tem, who is identified with the Young Horus or Young Thoth, destined to succeed his father. Could this be the origin of our Tat?

In Heliopolis (Annu), the ancient god Tem was equated with Ra. Tem was considered the Father-God, the Lord of Heaven, and the creator of the gods. Usertsen I rebuilt the sanctuary of Heliopolis around 2433 B.C. and dedicated it to Ra in the forms of Horus and Temu. Tem was the first living man-god known to the Egyptians, similar to how Osiris was the first dead man-god. Tem was always depicted in human form, signifying a divine manifestation in human likeness. It is difficult to determine when the Egyptians began worshipping gods in human form, but the worship of Tem is of great antiquity. The priests of Ra during the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties merged him with their god under the name Ra-Tem, indicating widespread worship and similar attributes to Ra.

In the Trismegistic tradition, where Thoth is central, the Young Tem represents the Young Thoth who succeeded his father upon his ascension to the gods.

Additionally, Egyptian texts show that besides Nefer-Tem, another son of Ptah was considered the third member of the Memphitic Triad. This son was known as Imhotep, whom the Greeks called Imouthes or Imuth, and equated with their Asclepius.The name Imhotep means "He Who Comes in Peace," which is fitting for the god who brought the knowledge of healing to humanity. Although primarily the god of medicine, Imhotep was also associated with study and learning in general.

As a god of learning, he shared some characteristics with Thoth and was believed to take Thoth's place in funeral ceremonies and overseeing the embalming of the dead. Later, Imhotep took on Thoth's role as the "Scribe of the Gods," and the creation of protective words of power for the deceased in the Underworld was attributed to him. In the "Ritual of Embalmment," it is said to the deceased: "Your soul joins with Imhotep while you are in the funeral valley."

The oldest shrine of Imhotep was near Memphis and was called the "Temple of Imhotep, the Son of Ptah," known to the Greeks as the Asclepieion. During the reign of Ptolemy IV Philopator (222-205 B.C.), a temple was built for Imhotep on the Island of Philae. Hieroglyphic inscriptions from this time describe him as: "Great One, Son of Ptah, the Creative God, made by Thenen, loved by him, the god of divine forms in the temples, who gives life to all men, the Mighty One of wonders, the Maker of times, who comes to those who call upon him wherever they may be, who gives children to the childless, the wisest and most learned one, the image and likeness of Thoth the Wise."

Imhotep-Asclepius was thus the "image and likeness of Thoth the Wise," similar to how Nefer-Tem was considered the Young Thoth. This distinction mirrors the difference between Asclepius and Tat in Trismegistic literature; Asclepius was trained in all philosophy, while Tat was young and still untrained."Imhotep," concludes Budge, "was the God who sent sleep to those who were suffering and in pain. He was responsible for those afflicted with any kind of disease; he was the Good Physician for both Gods and humans. He healed the bodies of mortals during life and oversaw their preservation after death. He was the God of physicians and all who practiced medicine and magic. When we recall that several early Kings of the Early Empire, as reported by Manetho and supported by papyrus evidence, wrote or commissioned works on medicine, it is clear that the God of medicine was recognized in Memphis from the archaic period."

Now, let's turn to Reitzenstein and his insightful Dissertation, "Hermes and His Disciples" (pp. 117 ff.).

The most common form of sermon in our Trismegistic literature is the instruction given to Tat, the "Son" of Hermes, who is the "Father" and Initiator. There were two collections of these instructions: "The General Sermons" and "The Expository Sermons." The name Tat is a variant of Thoth (Tehut). While Hermes is always described as Thrice-great, Tat has not yet achieved this level; he is still "Young." The name "Tat" appears in one of the prayers in the Magic Papyri, part of which is unreadable and can only be translated by following Reitzenstein's conjecture. "Show yourself to me in your prophetic power, O God of mighty mind, Thrice-great Hermes!"Let the ruler of the four corners of the Heavens and the four corners of the Earth appear. Be with me, you who are in Heaven, be with me, you from the Egg. . . . Speak, the Two Gods are around you,—one is called Thath and the other Haf. 

Spiegelberg identifies Haf with Hpj, the "Genius of the Dead," who is paired with Thoth in a Coptic Magic Papyrus from the second century AD, where Isis refers to "my father Ape-Thoth." This suggests that Haf is Anubis, also known as Harmanup or Horus as Anubis. Anubis, as Hermes-Tat, was thought in Egyptian tradition to be a writer of sacred texts.

The prayer mentioned seems to connect us with the inner mysteries of spiritual teaching. The God or Spiritual Master contains his disciple within himself, forming a pair or group of disciples. The relationship between Master and disciple is very intimate; it is not just like father and son, but also like mother and child, as the disciple is born from the Master's presence. The disciple is essentially his "ka" (spiritual double). Therefore, for the Egyptians, as Sethe and others have noted, a truly wise priest, one initiated into the Wisdom, was seen as an incarnation of Thoth. After the priest's death, he was worshipped as Thoth. For example, at Medinet Habu, there are remains of a shrine built during the reign of Ptolemy IX (146-117 BC) for a High Priest of Memphis named Teos, who was called "Teos the Ibis," identifying him with Thoth.What we learn from the belief in the "incarnation" of Thoth as the ultimate disciple of Wisdom, and the attribution of sacred literature to similar divine names, is that there was a strong belief in the unity of the Thoth tradition. At the same time, there was a necessary division of the sacred literature into older and newer periods. The Thoth of the older period was seen as a God, while the Thoth of more recent times was seen as a God-man. This is why Plato, in a famous passage from the Philebus, 18 B, is uncertain whether to call Thoth a God or a man.

THE DISCIPLES OF LORD HERMES IN PETOSIRIS AND NECHEPSO

In the oldest references to the Thoth-Hermes literature, no clear distinction between Hermes [Thoth] and Tat [Thoth] has been found. However, this absence of references doesn't prove much. By the second century B.C., Nechepso and Petosiris portrayed Hermes as the teacher of younger God-disciples, Anubis and Asclepius. It's interesting to note a passage from a horoscope for the first year of Emperor Antoninus Pius, set up by the priests of Hermes at Thebes. The Greek in this text is very poor, likely written by non-native speakers:

"After inquiry based on many books, handed down to us by the wise Ancients, the Chaldaeans,--both Petosiris, and especially King Necheus [i.e. Nechepso], since they also consulted our Lord Hermes and Asclepius, who is Imouthes, son of Hephestus..."

From this, we learn that in the second century A.D., the writings of Petosiris and Nechepso, along with the "Chaldaean Books," were still part of the Temple Library at Thebes. Additionally, Petosiris and Nechepso, in the second century B.C., relied on these Books as well as on Books attributed to both Hermes and Asclepius.From the fragments of Nechepso, we learn that he had access to a sermon by Asclepius called "Moirogenesis," which discussed the origins of Fate. He also had dialogues where Hermes taught Asclepius and Anubis about the mysteries of astrology. These works must date back to before the second century B.C. Sethe, in his essay on Asclepius-Imhotep, tried to show that Imuth was originally a man who was first worshipped as a god during the reign of Amasis around 1700 B.C.

However, Manetho presents a different story, writing about a king from the Third Dynasty (around 3700 B.C.) named Tosorthus, who reigned for twenty-nine years. The Egyptians called him Asclepius because of his medical knowledge. He built a stone house and greatly supported literature.

Tosothrus is also known as Tcheser or Dos'er, the second king of the Third Dynasty from Memphis. His "house of hewn stones" was confirmed by excavations by Prussian General Minutoli in 1819 in the Step-Pyramid of Sakkara. According to Budge, this temple is the oldest large building that has survived natural and human destruction.

In the Inscription of the Seven Famine Years, which is from the Ptolemaic period but based on an older record, we read in Sethe's restored Greek text that Tosothrus lived during the time of Imouthes. Imouthes was considered Asclepius by the Egyptians because of his medical knowledge. He discovered how to build with hewn stones and was also involved in literature.We learn that long before Manetho's time, there was Asclepian literature that included not only medicine but also scripture and "masonry." 

IMUTH-ASCLEPIUS THE MASTER MASON AND POET

Asclepius was particularly involved in sacred architecture. This is evident from Sethe's study, which found a book on temple-building attributed to Imuth, called "A Book that came from Heaven northwards from Memphis." According to this book, Ptolemy X. (Soter II.) and Ptolemy XI. (Alexander I.) expanded their ancestors' building at Edfu based on the plans for the Temple of Horus written by Imhotep, the son of Ptah. There were also ancient sermons or songs by Imhotep, including a saying from one of these sermons known as the "Song from the House of King Intf," which Sethe quotes:

"I have heard the words of Imhotep and Hardadaf; they are still much spoken of, but where are their abodes?" 

This might explain the statement in S. H. I. (Stob., Ec., i. 49; W. p. 467, 4) that Asclepius-Imuth was the inventor of poetry. Imuth was to the Egyptians what Orpheus, Linus, or Musaeus were to the Greeks. Reitzenstein concludes that there is an unbroken tradition from ancient Egyptian to Hellenistic literature. During Hellenistic times, the worship of the Divine Son of Ptah of Memphis and his main shrine at Memphis spread widely, even reaching Thebes and Philae. At Thebes, he was associated with the Theban Thoth and his counterpart Amenhotep, the twin brother of Imhotep (Asclepius) Son of Hapu, who lived under King Amenophis III. (Amenhotep) around 1450 B.C., and who claimed to have become familiar with the "Book of God" and to have seen in a vision the "Pre-eminence of Thoth."The main Temple of Asclepius in Memphis was still respected in later times, and even in Jerome's era, its priesthood was known for its secret knowledge.

AESCULAPIUS THE HEALER

Regarding the Cult of Aesculapius in Greece and its widespread influence, students of comparative religion history are well aware of it. However, we would like to share a notable excerpt from a recent speech by Rev. J. Estlin Carpenter to the students of Manchester College, Oxford, where he stated:

"Beyond Israel and its expectations, there is a vast world of religious phenomena that is incredibly diverse and seemingly endless. The extensive research of the past thirty years has only just begun to reveal its contents. Everywhere you look, you find beliefs similar to those in the New Testament. Professor Cheyne, in his noteworthy book 'Bible Problems,' has tried to trace the origins of four major doctrines about Jesus—the Virgin Birth, Descent into Hades, Resurrection, and Ascension. Inscriptions show us the very language of early Christianity. The hymns and rituals of other religions draw their power from similar ideas and express similar hopes. Does Jesus, according to the Gospels, give sight to the blind and raise the dead? So does Aesculapius. He, too, has a miraculous birth, faces danger as an infant, heals the sick, and brings the dead back to life. But then Zeus, jealous of his powers, strikes him with a thunderbolt and elevates him to the heavens. From there, Aesculapius continues to heal. His worship spreads across Greece, and after a major plague in Rome in 291 B.C., it is established on a sacred island in the Tiber."In the first century AD, you could find Asklepieia all around the Eastern Mediterranean. Pausanias mentions sixty-three in Greece alone. There were others in Asia Minor, Egypt, and Sicily, with nearly two hundred still traceable. These places served as both sanctuaries and medical schools. Numerous inscriptions detail cures or dedicate offerings, similar to those at Loretto or Lourdes. The temple by the Tiber became especially famous during the reign of Antoninus Pius for restoring a blind man's sight. Aesculapius was called 'king' and 'divine savior,' even 'savior of the universe.' He was identified with Zeus in his cosmic role and was considered 'most loving to man' on Earth. Harnack, in his book *Expansion of Christianity*, explored how these ideas influenced later Christianity, which was seen as a religion of healing for both body and mind. It's important to note that people believed the god revealed himself to those seeking his help. Origen stated that many Greeks and barbarians claimed to have seen Aesculapius healing, doing good, and predicting the future. 

Moving on to the Trismegistic tradition, Asclepius appears as a disciple of Trismegistus already trained in philosophy. This earlier training likely comes from the Ptah-tradition—Ptah being a God of Revelation, teaching through apocalypses, and Asclepius originally being his "son" and "priest." Ptah was not only a God of general revelations but also of medicine, teaching his wisdom to his son.This perspective is highlighted in a Hellenistic text that says:

"A remedy from the shrines of Hephaestus [Ptah] in Memphis, interpreted by the decision and philanthropy of Thrice-great Hermes. He decided it should be published for the benefit of humanity. It was found on a golden tablet written in Egyptian characters."

The tradition regarding when Asclepius joined the Trismegistic discipline is mentioned in K. K., 3 (Stob., Ec., i. 49; W. p. 387, 1). After Hermes's ascension, it states:

"Tat, who was both his son and heir to this knowledge, succeeded him. Not long after, Asclepius-Imuth joined according to the will of Ptah, who is Hephaestus." The exact historical accuracy of this tradition is uncertain; it suggests an early union of two mystical schools from the Thebaic and Memphitic traditions. This union may be somewhat similar to that of John the Baptist's and Jesus's disciples. What is evident from our Trismegistic writings is that the writer firmly believes that the Trismegistic tradition holds superior wisdom. Indeed, C. H., xiii. (xiv.) indicates that although Tat was younger and lacked the technical training of the Asclepius-grade, it is Tat, upon reaching "manhood," who succeeds to the leadership of the School, not Asclepius. Nevertheless, many Trismegistic writings, especially "The Definitions of Asclepius" and "The Perfect Sermon," show that both Tat and Asclepius participated in shared instruction, with Asclepius appearing as the more experienced scholar.This leads Reitzenstein (p. 122) to believe that the concept of a pair of disciples was created by the Hermes priests in Thebes and later adopted and expanded upon by the Ptah-Asclepius priests in Memphis for their own purposes. This could be true if we are forced to speculate about the vague details of history that can be inferred from these unclear references.

REGARDING AMMON

Lactantius (D. I., ii. 15, 7) mentions a "Perfect Sermon" to King Ammon among the Trismegistic writings of Asclepius, and notes a substantial ancient literature by Asclepius addressed to the same king. Reitzenstein (p. 123) also states that C. H., (xvii.) assumes the existence of writings by Tat addressed to King Ammon. However, I believe the dialogue is actually between Asclepius and the King, and that Tat has mistakenly been substituted for Asclepius by a copyist. Regardless, there was a significant body of work by Hermes addressed to Ammon, as evidenced by P. S. A., i. 2, and Stobaeus, Exx. xii.-xix. This tradition is also found in the later Hermetic text, Iatromathematica, which is addressed to Ammon.

PROPHET AND KING

Here, we find another type of literature, also very ancient, where the wise Priest and Prophet is depicted as the teacher or revealer of hidden wisdom to the King. This relationship was also seen between the Priest and Prophet Petosiris and King Nechepso. This type of relationship extends back to pre-Greek Egypt. According to Plutarch, who likely relayed information directly from Manetho, it was essential for a King to be initiated into the wisdom of the Priests to be a true King.Imuth-Asclepius is mentioned by Manetho as an inventor, similar to Thoth, the god known for his inventions. In Plato’s "Phaedrus," Socrates tells a story about Thoth presenting his inventions to King Thamus for approval. Thamus, ruling all of Egypt from Thebes, is also known as Ammon. In Hecataeus' writings, Osiris, King of Thebes, reviews inventions and honors Hermes for his renowned creations.

Thoth, in the Theban Thoth-cult, is seen as the representative of the King and the Light-God Ra (Ammon). In Seti I's tomb, there's an inscription that reads: "You are in my place, my representative. Therefore, you are called Thoth, Representative of the Light-God Ra."

These clues suggest that Plato might have based his story on an ancient Egyptian tradition where Thoth gave written instructions to the King. This tradition existed in Egypt long before it was adopted by Hellenistic writers.

However, there haven’t been any references to books written by Imhotep (Asclepius) to Ammon from the pre-Greek period. Sethe mentions Amenhotep, who lived in the fifteenth century B.C., as a disciple and seer of Thoth.Amenhotep was well-known as a teacher of wisdom and a discoverer of magical books. He was also likely famous for his own writings. Over time, Amenhotep became associated with Imhotep-Asclepius as his twin brother, and during the Ptolemaic period, he was honored as a god in Thebes. This marks the merging of another tradition, involving a writer who was a follower of Thoth and became confused with Asclepius-Imuth, son of Ptah. According to P. S. A., xxxvii. 3, there were two Asclepiuses, an older and a later one.

A Greek porcelain artifact gives us some insight into the Sayings of Asclepius. The first three sayings are borrowed from the Sayings of the Seven Sages of Greece, while the rest may have Egyptian origins. This evidence is important because, by the third century B.C., Orphic Sayings were already being combined with Egyptian material. Here, we see Greek wisdom integrated with an Egyptian tradition of Imuth's Sayings. Further research might provide more information on the development of Asclepius literature before the Greek period and in its early Hellenistic forms.

The existing evidence supports the claims made by the author of the Trismegistic "Definitions of Asclepius unto the King" or "The Perfect Sermon of Asclepius unto the King" (C. H., xvi). These claims are based on a well-established tradition in the School, which suggests that translating the mystical Egyptian Asclepian writings into the precise Greek language brought about significant changes.### The Sacred Group of Four

In "The Perfect Sermon" by Hermes, he gives guidance to his three disciples—Asclepius, Tat, and Ammon—gathered in a "holy place." The writer of this sermon isn't focused on the historical details but on the deeper, more personal aspects of the teaching. For Hermes, Asclepius, Tat, and Ammon form a sacred triad, and with Hermes himself, they become the "sacred group of four."

We can compare this to the group of three frequently mentioned by the Evangelists—James, John, and Peter—who were often with Jesus during significant moments of his life. Clement of Alexandria notes that:

"After His Resurrection, the Lord imparted the Gnosis to James the Just, John, and Peter; they then passed it on to the other Apostles and eventually to the Seventy."

Here, I suggest there is a similar concept. Asclepius is the main teacher, much like James in Christian tradition. Peter, representing Ammon, is the organizer and leader of the Church, symbolizing kingly power. John, like Tat, is the Beloved who grasps the essence of the teachings best; James is more knowledgeable about formal aspects, and Peter is the organizer who sometimes shows a lack of control and understanding in various apocryphal stories. An interesting piece of Johannine tradition further illustrates that John succeeded in spiritual leadership, just as Tat succeeds Trismegistus in our sermons.You have heard what I said to you: I am not from this world, but the Comforter is among you, teaching through the Comforter. Just as the Father sent Me, I am sending you. Truly, I tell you, I am not from this world; but John will be your father until he joins Me in Paradise. And He anointed them with the Holy Spirit. 

In an addition to John 19:26-30, it says:

He told His mother, "Do not weep; I go to My Father and to Eternal Life. Look, your son! He will take My place." Then He said to the disciple, "Look, your mother!" Then, bowing His head, He gave up His spirit. 

At this critical moment, the Master made John the spiritual Father of the School in His place. This also applies to Tat.

THE TRIAD OF DISCIPLES

The idea of triads and other groups, such as five and seven, united in the presence of a Master, is familiar to students of Druidical mysticism. In our "Perfect Sermon," we have such a triad, each disciple distinguished by strong characteristics. Harmonizing these characteristics, so that the disciples may be like the fingers of one hand for the Master's use, is very difficult. One is characterized by Power, another by Knowledge, and another by Love. All three must sacrifice their strongest individual trait to blend together into the Master's Wisdom. This seems to be the inner meaning of our "Perfect Sermon," and regardless of the history of its evolution, the intimate teaching of Christ to the Three was known to our writer.### Chnum the Good Daimon

Let's now look at the type of Trismegistic literature where Osiris and Isis appear as students. First, we should consider the God Chnum, also known as Chnubis or Chnuphis (Knuphis), whose name appears on many Abraxas and Abraxoid gems. Chnum was to Southern Egypt what Ptah of Memphis was to Northern Egypt. He was the creator of humans, shaping them like a potter shaping pots on a wheel. Chnum was the Demiurge and God of the heart, with his main worship center at Syene and the Island of Elephantine. Here, he was seen as the Father of Osiris. We hear of astrological dialogues between Chnum and Osiris, such as:

"And all that Kouphis, who is with them [the Egyptians], the Good Daimon, handed down, and his disciple Osiris discussed."

These writings were grouped with those of Nechepso and also with our Trismegistic writings. Compare this to a passage in Firmicus Maternus:

"All things which Mercurius (Hermes) and Chnubis handed down to Aesculapius (Asclepius), which Petosiris discovered and Nechepso."

### Osiris: Disciple of Agathodaimon the Thrice-Greatest

Patristic references to our Trismegistic literature inform us that Osiris was considered the disciple of Agathodaimon, who is also called Thrice-Greatest. However, there is no evidence that Hermes himself appears as a disciple of Chnubis, contrary to what Reitzenstein says. Lactantius introduces Fragment xix with: "But I [Lactantius] will recall the words of Hermes the Thrice-Greatest; in 'To Asclepius' he says: 'Osiris said: How, then, O Thrice-Greatest, Good Daimon, did the Earth in its entirety appear?'"Here we have a sermon where Hermes quotes a tradition in which Osiris is a disciple of Agathodaimon, who is also called Trismegistus. This suggests that the Agathodaimon-Osiris dialogue is an old tradition, likely one of the earliest forms of Trismegistic literature, probably as old as the ancient Poemandres type. This tradition seems influenced by the "Books of the Chaldeans" cosmogenesis, which strongly impacted Petosiris and Nechepso in the early second century B.C. Agathodaimon relates to Osiris as Poemandres does to Hermes.

In early Alchemical literature, there is a treatise by Agathodaimon addressed to Osiris, implying other similar works exist. These teachings of the Good Daimon often align closely with our Trismegistic doctrines. Additionally, in this literature, Hermes refers to Agathodaimon and considers himself his disciple. Reitzenstein suggests that the tradition of the Agathodaimonites may have originally come from Chnum, but I believe there isn't enough evidence to confirm this. While the term Agathodaimon is general, it cannot be solely linked to Chnum. Osiris is just as much Agathodaimon as Chnum. In C. H. xii. (xiii.), which discusses the General Mind, Good Mind, or Good Daimon, Agathodaimon is used in a broad sense. The three quotes by Hermes from the "Sayings of the Good Daimon" (sections 1, 8, 13) are in Heracleitus' words inspired by the Logos, indicating that Agathodaimon equates to Logos. Therefore, the origin of Agathodaimon is not solely Chnum, and Hermes cannot be called a disciple of Chnubis unless there are texts describing Thoth that way.In our Trismegistic literature, the teachings are clear and straightforward. For example, in C. H., x. (xi.) 23, it says, "He [Mind] is the Good Daimon." However, when Reitzenstein (p. 128) claims that the sentence in section 25 of the same text, "For this reason, one can say that a man on earth is a mortal god, while God in heaven is an immortal man," is part of the Chnuphis literature, we believe he is overreaching unless we replace Chnuphis with the general term Agathodaimon, meaning Logos. Furthermore, when Reitzenstein (p. 129) suggests that the fragments he found show Hermes was later added to the Agathodaimon literature, gradually overshadowing Osiris, the Son of the God of Revelation, we are not convinced this reflects the accurate history. In the Osiris myth, Hermes is always the teacher of wisdom, not Osiris.

Nevertheless, Reitzenstein has shown through various quotations (pp. 129-133) that a widespread Chnuphis literature existed before the second century B.C., in the Agathodaimonistic sense. During Hellenistic times, the worship of Chnuphis as the Primal Deity and God of Revelation was well-established, and notably, his symbol was the serpent. Thus, the symbol of Agathodaimon as Logos was the Serpent of Wisdom, linking us to the Gnostic Ophites and Naassenes traditions. In Ptolemaic times, his counterpart, Isis, was also represented as a serpent, and both were often depicted as serpents with human heads, embodying wisdom. Horus, their son, was symbolized with a hawk head and a serpent body. Additionally, Agathodaimon, in his sun aspect, was depicted as a serpent with a lion's head. He is the Aeon.ISIS, LADY OF WISDOM, DISCIPLE OF THRICE-GREATEST HERMES

In our Trismegistic literature, besides Hermes and his followers, and Agathodaimon and his followers, there's another figure: Isis and her followers. Isis is the ancient Lady of all wisdom and the Teacher of all magic. In the early Hellenistic period, she replaces Hermes as the Orderer of the cosmos. Plutarch even calls her the Lady of the Heart and Tongue, just like Hermes. She "sees" the teachings.

One of her followers, mentioned in Stobaean Excerpt xxxi, is likely King Ammon. In a Magic Papyrus, she is also shown teaching Asclepius. However, the more common depiction is of Isis teaching her son Horus. Lucian mentions Pythagoras visiting Egypt to learn wisdom from her prophets, saying that the sage of Samos went into the sacred places and learned the Books of Horus and Isis. This type of literature includes our lengthy Stobaean Excerpts xxv.-xxvii.

However, Isis gains her wisdom directly from the ancient Hermes, through spiritual vision. I have discussed all this in my Commentaries on Excerpts xxv.-xxvii. The conclusion is that, according to the Poemandrists, no matter how ancient any tradition is—whether from Agathodaimon, Osiris, or Isis—the direct teaching of the Mind surpasses it.Here is a more modern and simplified version of the given text:

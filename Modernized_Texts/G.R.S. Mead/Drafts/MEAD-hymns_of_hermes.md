## The Service of Song

Clement of Alexandria tells us that the entire religious philosophy of the Egyptian priesthood, including their wisdom, discipline, and various arts and sciences, was contained in the Books of Hermes (Thoth). These Books were categorized into forty-two sections and grouped according to the different divisions of the priests.

Clement describes a sacred ceremony, a procession of priests in various orders, led by a representative of the order of Singers. These Singers were marked by musical symbols, some carried in their hands and others embroidered on their robes. The Singers had to memorize two sections of the Books of Hermes: those containing Hymns in Honor of the Gods and Encomia, or Hymns in Praise of the Kings.

Many examples of similar hymns praising the Gods can be found in Egyptian inscriptions and papyri. Some of these hymns are profound expressions of the soul's praise for the majesty and transcendence of the Supreme, comparable to similar praises in other great scriptures. Unfortunately, the hymnbooks of Thoth that Clement refers to are lost to us. He may have been mistaken in specifically identifying them, just as he was undoubtedly mistaken in thinking they were collections of hymns composed by a single individual, Hermes.The grand idea of Thoth as the source of all sacred writings and the teacher of religion and philosophy was Egyptian, not Greek. When the Greeks had to translate the name "Thoth" into their own pantheon, they settled for "Hermes," which was a poor substitute. Thoth, as the source of all sacred texts and the leader of all priestly practices, was, according to Iamblichus, a name that the Egyptians believed applied to all priests. This meant that every priest, in their sacred role, embodied some aspect of Thoth, the Great Priest or Master among the Gods, known by his earthly name Thoth Tehuti. Thoth was the spirit guiding all priests. When some Greeks eventually understood the true nature of priestly mysteries, they realized that simply calling Thoth "Hermes" was insufficient. They therefore added the honorific title "Thrice-greatest" to "Hermes" to show respect. This small volume will discuss the hymns of this Thrice-greatest Hermes, which were inspired by the wisdom of ancient Egypt, interpreted through Greek thought, and expressed in the beautiful language of Greece. Unfortunately, no collection of these hymns survives. We can only piece together the remaining fragments from the Trismegistic literature that escaped the destruction by those who valued only certain texts. The main teachings of the Trismegistic knowledge are contained in a sacred sermon titled "Poemandres."Originally, this may have been the Greek transliteration of an Egyptian name, but from the text, it is clear that Greek followers of this Gnosis understood it to mean "The Shepherd of Men" or "Man-shepherd." This Shepherd was not a human, but a Divine Humanity or the Great Mind, inspiring all spiritual initiations. This majestic Reality, a limitless Presence of Light, Life, and Goodness, enveloped the contemplative mind of those devoted to God, beauty, and truth. In His instruction to one striving to be a true self-aware Hermes, Poemandres says:

"I, Mind, am present with holy and good men, the pure and merciful, those who live piously. My Presence aids them, and they quickly gain knowledge of all things, win the Father's love through their pure lives, give Him thanks, invoke blessings on Him, and sing hymns with ardent love." (ii, 14)

This instruction is repeated in the sermon called "The Key," where it is written:

"The Mind guides the pious soul to the Light of Knowledge. Such a soul tirelessly sings praises to God, blesses all men, and does good in word and deed, imitating its Creator." (ii, 155)

The conditions for reaching this desirable state are:

Only the good can know the Good, as one of the invocations to Hermes the Good Mind in the Greek Magic Papyri says: "I invoke you! Come to me, O Good, you who are altogether good, come to the good!" (i, 86)

Only the pure can know the Pure; and by "Pure," Hermes likely meant more than is commonly understood by the term."Pure" is what stays true to itself, neither too much nor too little; it represents balance and harmony, the mysterious force that unites all opposites and serves as their source and conclusion—the Divine Justice. Only the merciful can truly understand the Merciful, the source of the endless diversity of Divine Love. For them, the Divine Presence is a support. In the fertile ground of spiritual nature—good, pure, and merciful—the Divine Presence plants the seeds of heavenly wisdom. From this pure foundation can arise the true person, a child of freedom and good will.

For those unaware of spiritual truths, the Divine Presence also aids them, though they may not realize it. It often appears as a hindrance, preventing them from falling into further ignorance and limitation. The soil must be cleared and prepared before it can be sown. When a person willingly changes their way of life to align with the heavenly order, they connect consciously with the Divine Presence. This connection energizes their entire being; sunlight floods their true heart, awakening it to speak true words. God grants speech to the heart in the unseen realm, just as He does to the departed souls, and this silent speech is a constant expression of righteous actions.

There is also spoken speech, which becomes clear in human language through hymns of praise and gratitude to God. This is the liturgy of devotion that responds to the Divine and is thus responsible.Indeed, this is the foundation of all worship and rituals, even in their most basic forms and reflections—in the dreams of human hearts. The Trismegistic writings deal with the conscious realization of true Gnostic Passion, where feelings are consciously transformed into knowledge. Singing hymns on earth mirrors a heavenly mystery. To truly sing in harmony, a person must align their lower nature and transform it into order. Previously, they have been singing out of tune, chaotically—howling, shrieking, crying, cursing—rather than singing clearly and offering 'reasonable sacrifices' to God.

The proper alignment of the parts of their true 'body' or 'heart' has not yet been completed; they are still scattered by their chaotic passions, like the body parts of Osiris in ancient Egyptian myth, spread out in their body of death. The spiritual aspect, like Isis, is still mourning and gathering these parts, waiting for the New Dawn when the last part, the organ of Gnosis, will complete the order, and the New Man will arise from the dead. Only when these parts are harmonized can they create cosmic music.

It doesn't matter whether the old myth speaks of the fourteen parts of the dead Osiris, or later teachings speak of the seven spheres of creative Harmony that form the parts of every person, viewing them as working in two ways depending on the individual's will—it all refers to the same mystery. Man in limitation is dual, like his physical limbs; man in freedom, configured cosmically, is united in all things. When this 'change of gnostic tendency' occurs, there is a marvelous transformation of the entire nature.He lets go of his destructive desires, those impulses that fight against God, so that what the anonymous author of the mystical book The Dream of Ravan calls the 'Divine Catastrophe' can happen, and the Titan within him can be quickly transformed into a God. Even though these passions seem evil to us now and appear to come from forces opposing God, they are not truly bad. They are part of our natural experiences within the Divine Harmony, the mysterious force of fate that manifests in seven ways according to our Trismegistic tradition. The Divine Harmony is the creative tool of the Divine Energy that constantly forms substance for consciousness, gradually perfecting a form that can reflect the Perfect Man. 

The natural energies that have been working through him unconsciously, to bring about self-awareness, are seen by the beginner in his spiritual journey as hostile. They have given him experiences that now feel like rags he wants to discard in order to wear new garments of power and majesty, exchanging the rough clothes of a slave for the royal robes of a King. Although the new garments come from the same material and are made by the same energies, the weaver is now working to change their texture and design. He is joyfully learning to follow the plan of the Great Weaver, willingly unraveling the rags of his past flaws to reweave them into 'fine linen' suitable for King Osiris.This transformative change is described in our text as the Great Mind teaching the little mind, following the removal of the soul's vices. These vices are said to arise from the negative energies of the seven spheres of Fate's Harmony. The subsequent state of blessedness is illustrated by the following statement:

After shedding all the energies of the Harmony, he reaches the nature of the Eighth sphere, where he joins those who praise the Father. They welcome him with joy, and he, now like those who dwell there, hears the Powers above the Eighth sphere singing their praises to God in their own language. Together, they go to the Father and willingly surrender to the Powers, becoming Powers themselves and uniting with God. This is the ultimate goal for those who have attained Gnosis—to become one with God (ii, 16). 

This change reflects the transformation from an ordinary person, described by Hermes as a "procession of Fate," to true manhood, which ultimately leads to divinity. The ancient Egyptians believed that humans had at least nine forms of existence or modes of being. The phrase "clothed in his proper Power" likely refers to one of these aspects of human nature.The term "sekhem" is usually translated as "power," but we don't have a clear description to confirm this translation. Therefore, I suggest that the "khaibit," often translated as "shadow," might be what our text refers to. In Egyptian teachings, the "khaibit" was a luminous atmosphere around a radiant being, which could assimilate itself to divine glory. This atmosphere was made up of ethereal layers that both shaded and diffused its light, much like Earth's atmosphere does with sunlight. This concept was symbolized by the linen wrappings of mummies, as "Thoth, the Divine Wisdom, wraps the spirit of the justified in fine linen." Similarly, Jesus, during a sacred act, wore a linen cloth, which Tertullian called the "proper garment of Osiris." Plutarch also noted that priests wore linen because its color resembled the ethereal radiance surrounding the cosmos.

This mystery is further illustrated in the transfiguration of Jesus as described in the Gnostic gospel Pistis Sophia, which has strong Egyptian influences. It depicts a profound transformation in Jesus' inner nature. He ascends to clothe himself in the Robe of Glory and returns to his disciples, now wearing the Robe of Power. "They saw Jesus descending, shining exceedingly; there was no limit to the light around him, shining even more brightly than when he ascended into the heavens. The light was indescribable by anyone in this world."He emitted exceedingly bright rays, which were immeasurable and varied in shape and type. Some rays were more impressive than others, but they were all pure light. 

There were three levels of this light, each surpassing the one below it. The second level, in the middle, was greater than the first, and the third, the most magnificent, surpassed the other two. The first level of brightness was similar to the light that shone on Jesus before he ascended to heaven and was very consistent in its illumination.

This threefold glory, I believe, represents the "body of light," related to the eighth, ninth, and tenth spheres of glory in a perfect ten-level scale. In our text, "clothed in his proper Power" likely refers to the seven unified spheres' powers, with the eighth being the pure mind's vehicle, based on Platonic and Egyptian traditions. This vehicle was "atomic" rather than "molecular," using modern scientific terms, meaning it was simple and uniform.

When this spiritual transformation occurs in a person, it also changes their physical substance, allowing them to harmonize with the spheres and sing praises to the Father. They understand nature's language and continuously celebrate the joy of life. They sing joyfully and hear the joyful songs of the Sons of God, who form the first invisible choir. These beings welcome the transformed individual, and their hymn, "Come unto Us," can be found in the same text, Pistis Sophia, welcoming the returning soul on the Great Day.But there's more; above and beyond, there are higher choirs of even greater beings who sing. However, the newly awakened cannot yet understand or endure their song, as they sing in their own language. There are many tongues of angels, archangels, spirits, and gods in their various ranks. Yet, the man has begun to sense the freedom of the universe; he feels like a true citizen of the cosmos and resonates with these higher Powers. He experiences a profound union that dispels all fear and yearns for the ultimate Sacred Marriage. In this union, he will joyfully surrender all that he has been, to become one with those who truly exist, embodying all that has been, is, and will be—becoming one with God, the All and One.

It is clear that our Hymns of Hermes connect directly with a tradition that viewed spiritual life as a continual act of singing. This aligns with the Egyptian belief that humans were created solely to worship the Gods and serve them devoutly. The entire duty of man was seen as the expression of 'true words' or the constant singing of a harmonious song through thought, word, and deed. By doing so, man would become like the Gods, and ultimately, become a God himself, joining the Great God in the "Boat of the Millions of Years," or "Barque of the Aeons," ensuring his safety for eternity.

Now, we will look at the four hymns preserved in Greek from this truly sacred liturgy. The first hymn is attached to the "Poemandres" treatise and seems intended to give a human sense of the Praise-giving of the Powers mentioned earlier.As we will see later, the less educated members of the community eagerly wanted the words of this Song revealed to them, thinking it was a hymn like those on Earth. They didn't yet understand that it was a heavenly version of all Earthly praise, whether expressed by humans, animals, trees, or stones. The first part of our hymn consists of nine lines divided into three groups, each starting with "Holy art Thou!" It is formatted as a three-fold "Holy, Holy, Holy!" and we can call it "A Triple Trisagion" for lack of a better title.

A TRIPLE TRISAGION

Holy art Thou, O God, the Father of all things.
Holy art Thou, O God, Whose Will is fulfilled by Your own Powers.
Holy art Thou, O God, Who desires to be known and is known by Your own.
Holy art Thou, Who created all things by Your Word.
Holy art Thou, from Whom all nature is an Image.
Holy art Thou, Whose Form nature has never replicated.
Holy art Thou, more powerful than all power.
Holy art Thou, surpassing all greatness.
Holy art Thou, greater than all praise.
Accept the pure offerings of my mind, from my soul and heart, always reaching up to You, O indescribable One, Whose Name only Silence can express! Listen to my prayer that I may never lack Knowledge—Knowledge which is the nature of our being—and fill me with Your Power and Grace, so that I may bring Light to those ignorant of the Truth, my Brothers and Your Children! For this reason, I believe and bear witness. I go towards Life and Light. Blessed art Thou, O Father. Your Man aspires to be holy like You, as You granted him the full authority to be.
"Holy art Thou, O God, the Father of all things."God is first honored as the Father of all things, the source of all greatness and ultimate mysteries that exist as both many and one—the aspects of the Divine Being in its purest form. "Holy are You, O God, whose Will is fulfilled through Your own Powers." Next, God is praised as the Power behind everything; for our Gnostics believe that Will is how the Deity reveals itself through the continual act of self-creation. "From You" comes everything when God is seen as the Divine Father, and "Through You" comes everything when God is seen as the Divine Mother. This Will is the Divine Love, the source of all fulfillment, certainty, and happiness. The Deity continually initiates itself into its own mysteries. "Holy are You, O God, who desires to be known and is known by Your own." God's Will is Gnostic; He desires to be known. The Divine Purpose is fulfilled in self-knowledge. God can be known, but only by "His own," which Basilides, the Christian Gnostic, calls the Divine Sonship, or as Philo and other Gnostics of the time refer to as the Race of the Sons of God. This Sonship is a collective, not an individual, because those who belong to it have ceased to be separate and have surrendered themselves to the Powers, thus becoming Powers themselves and being in God. They are united, no longer divided and using separate senses and organs; they form the Intelligible Word or Reason (Logos), which is also the Intelligible World (Kosmos) or the Order of all things.The next three praise-givings celebrate the same trinity of Being, Bliss, and Intelligence, but in a different way—the manifestation in space, time, and substance of the Sensible Universe, or Cosmos of forms and species. The three aspects of this Divine self-manifestation are referred to as Word, All-nature, and Form. 

Word represents Being because it is through the Word or Reason that all things are established and defined. All-nature is the foundation or substance of their existence, the nurturing ground that gives them Bliss and continuous becoming, as an image of Eternity. Form is the imprint of Divine Intelligence, the source of all change and transformation.

The final praise focuses on God's transcendence, emphasizing that human language cannot fully express God's greatness. Therefore, the only suitable worship is through reason, the Divine principle within humans, reflecting the Divine Man, the Logos. This involves continually elevating one's nature to draw closer to God in the silent ecstasy of contemplation—when the individual soul meets the Divine alone, as Plotinus describes.

The Name of God can only be truly expressed by Silence, as Christian Gnosis tells us that Silence, or Sige, is the Divine Spouse who fully expresses the Divine Son, the Name or Logos of God. The prayer is for Gnosis, the realization of Sonship, or the self-awareness of the unity shared by the Son with the Father.This is to be accomplished by fulfilling the man's entire nature and overcoming his imperfections, making him whole and eternal. This is achieved through the descent of great power upon him and the blessing of God's grace, which has always been his divine mother but now becomes his divine spouse or partner. The prayer is not for oneself but for others, so the man can become a source of enlightenment for those still in darkness, unaware of the good news of divine sonship and the wisdom they can attain. Even though they are ignorant, they are still brothers of Christ and sons of God. In this state of praise, the traveler, as he sings on the divine path, feels certain that he is on the right path, moving towards light and life, the eternal unity of fatherhood and motherhood in the Good, the Divine Father-Mother, two in one and three in one.

As God has been praised for his holiness, being worthy of worship and admiration, so the divine within man now consciously seeks to become like Him, following the purpose and command of the Father who has destined him for this end and given him power over all things. This is a beautiful psalm, the Hymn of Hermes, a praise from someone who has "reached the Plain of Truth" or become aware of their own divine nature. This person has become a true Hermes, capable of interpreting the deeper meaning of religion and leading souls from death to life, a true guide of souls.It doesn't matter much who wrote it—whether Greek or Syrian, or under which name. The specific years they lived are only important to historians. What matters to us is the expression of a soul. Here, we have a man sharing the deepest experiences of his inner life from his heart. He explains how a person can come to know God by first understanding themselves, thus revealing their spiritual nature and shedding the layers that have confined their true self for ages. Now, let's move to our next hymn. It is in a beautiful little treatise titled "Though Unmanifest, God is Most Manifest," where 'father' Hermes speaks to 'son' Tat. The sermon discusses the mysterious manifestation of Divine Energy, known in Sanskrit as Maya, often wrongly translated as "Illusion"—unless we understand illusion in its original sense of Sport and Play. In its highest sense, Maya is the Creative Will at play, the World-Drama, or God in action. The Greek equivalent of Maya is phantasia, which I have translated as "thinking manifest" due to the lack of an exact English term. The Phantasy of God is the Power (Shakti in Sanskrit) of constant self-manifestation or self-imagining, and it is how everything in existence comes from the unmanifest. As our treatise says:

He is both what exists and what does not. He has made what exists visible and keeps what does not exist within Himself.He is the God beyond all names—unseen and yet the most evident. The mind alone can contemplate Him, but He is also visible to the eyes. He has no body and many bodies, or rather, He is in every body. There is nothing that He is not, for He is everything, and everything is Him. He encompasses both what we are conscious of and what lies beyond our consciousness or memory, existing in our eternal nature. He is both the revealed and the hidden, hidden within the revealed and revealed within the hidden, manifest in all we have been and hidden in all we will be. From nothing, He creates everything—though it is really from Himself. He is what the mind can contemplate, the Intelligible Universe that the senses cannot perceive, and also everything that the physical and superphysical senses can perceive, the whole Sensible Universe.

He can be understood from monotheistic, polytheistic, pantheistic, and many other perspectives—as many as the human mind can conceive, and even more that it cannot imagine. He is both physical and non-physical in perpetual union. He is in no body, for no body can contain Him, yet He is in every body and every body is in Him. "There is nothing that He is not, for He is everything." It is puzzling why so many in the West fear the idea of incorporating pantheistic views into their understanding of God.This fear is actually an overconfident or rash assumption, as they boldly try to define the Divine based on their limited ideas of what they want God to be. They become very upset when their self-satisfaction is challenged by the notion that God cannot be confined to their narrow views. What right do we, as ignorant and short-lived beings, have to exclude God from anyone or anything? They might argue that it is not God who is excluded, but rather we who exclude ourselves from God. However, no matter how hard we try, we cannot truly do this. It's impossible to separate ourselves from God because we are part of Him. Did we create ourselves? If we did, that would make us God, as only the Divine has the power to create itself. Some devout people might still insist that God is purely good. Agreed, but what is "Good"? Is it just our idea of good, or the Good for all creatures? If God is the Good of all creatures, He must also be the Evil of all creatures, because what is good for one may be evil for another, and vice versa—maintaining a balance. It's a limited perspective to say that God is only good and to define this as a specific kind of good that suits us, rather than what is truly good for everyone. It is necessary for there to be apparent evil in the universe, as in pantheism, and for human notions of good to fall short of the true reality. The wise person, or rather the person seeking true knowledge, is the one who can see the good in every evil and the insufficiency in every good as understood by humans.If we agree with Hermes that "All are He and He is all," we don't claim to fully understand what this means. We simply acknowledge that we are confronting the ultimate mystery of all things, a mystery so profound that it leaves us speechless and humble. Therefore, the mystic who wrote these lines continues his reflection with a beautiful hymn, expressing the learner's mind's inability to properly praise God. We might call this hymn "A Hymn to All-Father God."

A HYMN TO ALL-FATHER GOD

Who can sing praises to You, or of You? Where should I look to sing Your praise—above, below, inside, outside? There is no path or place around You, nor anything apart from You. Everything is in You; everything comes from You. You give all and take nothing, for You possess everything and nothing is beyond You. When, Father, shall I sing to You? No one can grasp Your time. What should I sing about? The things You have made, or the things You haven't? The things You've revealed, or the things You've hidden? How should I sing to You? As myself? With something of my own? As someone different? For You are whatever I might be; You are whatever I might do; You are whatever I might say. You are all, and there is nothing that You are not. You are everything that exists, and You are what does not exist—Mind when You think, Father when You create, God when You act, and Good and Maker of all things. Who is capable of adequately singing God's praises when it requires the entire universe and countless other universes to truly praise God?Who, then, among us can truly understand how to praise God, when we don't even fully know who we are? As we start to realize that our true self must be God, how can God praise Himself as if He were someone else? When 'I' and 'You' are essentially one, praising another seems to stray from the divine understanding. Can God be limited by space? Certainly not, for God is everywhere, and all places exist within Him. God is not more in the heart than in any other part of the body; He is in everything, and everything is in Him. There is no specific direction in which to look for God, for He is in every direction the mind can think. Even in what we consider evil thoughts, one who understands this divine awareness will say that the only true evil is not recognizing that God is in all things. With this understanding, even the wrong side of thoughts presents itself with the right side in the joy of pure thinking. The idea of the next act of praise may seem confusing and contradictory, but in the highest realms of human thought, everything appears as a paradox because it is the state where all opposites are reconciled.It might be said that if God is the giver of all things, He must also be the receiver of all things; but this idea can be equally well expressed by thinking of everything and nothing, as by the concept of giving and receiving. God clearly takes nothing, as He needs nothing, since He already has everything. If God cannot be limited by space, He also cannot be limited by time. Therefore, the true Gnostic hymn of praise cannot be sung just at one moment, but must be sung eternally; a person must become a continuous song of praise in thought, word, and deed. The Deity cannot be praised for one thing over another, as all things come from God equally. Someone who wishes to be like God should have no preferences and should view all things equally, embracing them with equal love.

Why should a Gnostic praise God as distinct from the world? Should he praise the divine for his own existence, or because he is different from those who are not enlightened? The futility of such distinctions becomes clear when such questions arise, and the wise devotee dismisses them boldly: "Because You are whatever I may be; You are whatever I may do; You are whatever I may speak." There is no separation in reality. Whatever the person is in this ecstatic state, it is God's being in him; whatever the person does, it is God's action in him; whatever the person speaks, it is God's word in him. To such a consciousness, God is truly all things, both seen and unseen.God is Mind when we think of Him as thinking, devising, and planning; God is Father when we see Him as willing, creating, and bringing everything into existence; and God is Good when we think of Him as giving energy, life, and light to all things. He is the ultimate goal of everything, just as He is the creator of all. Our next hymn comes from the initiation ritual called "The Secret Sermon on the Mountain," also known as "Concerning Rebirth and the Promise of Silence," but it could also be called "The Initiation of Tat."

This Rebirth or Regeneration is the mystery of Spiritual Birth, aimed at becoming a pure spiritual being. In the lesser mysteries, the focus was on physical birth, explaining how a person is born into the world. One deals with physical birth, while the other focuses on spiritual rebirth.

The mystic rite involves the 'laying on of hands,' a blessing given by Hermes, the earthly guide, representing the Great Initiator, the Good Mind. These Hands of Blessing are not physical but symbolize spiritual powers, like rays from the spiritual Sun, as seen in Egyptian frescoes of the Atem cult. Each Ray represents a Gnostic Power, which dispels the darkness of the soul's vices and transforms the physical body into a spiritual one, resembling light or a star.

This initiation ritual brings the divine essence within a person to life. Initially, this inner God is like a newborn, unable to hear or see but able to feel.When the ritual was completed, Tat asked eagerly to hear the marvelous Song of the Powers, which he had read about in his studies and which his father, Hermes, reportedly heard when he ascended to the Eighth Sphere. "Father, I wish to hear the hymn you said you heard when you reached the Eighth Sphere."

Hermes replied that it was true: the Divine Mind, during Hermes's own initiation into masterhood, had foretold that he would hear this Heaven-Song. Hermes praised Tat for purifying himself and being ready to "strike his tent," meaning to free himself from the body's constraints and rise from the tomb that had imprisoned his soul, as the Oracle said about Plotinus.

However, Hermes explained that Tat misunderstood. There is no single Song of the Powers written in human words or kept secret in manuscripts or oral traditions. The Divine Mind did not pass on to Hermes more than what was written, knowing that Hermes could learn and see all things on his own. The Powers within Hermes, and within all people, naturally break into song. This song can be sung in many ways and languages, inspired by the enlightened singer.

A reborn person becomes a psalmist and poet, in tune with the Great Harmony, and cannot help but sing God's praises. He creates new hymns rather than repeating those of others.But Tat persists; his soul longs to hear some echo of the Great Song. "Father, I wish to hear; I long to know these things!" Finally, Hermes is persuaded and decides to give him a model of praise that he can use instead of his previous prayers, which were more suitable for someone in the state of faith. Hermes tells Tat to calm himself and wait in respectful silence to hear the powerful song of praise that will connect all of Nature to the Divine. This is no ordinary hymn but a sacred act of knowledge. Therefore, Hermes commands:

"Be still, my son! Hear the praise that keeps the soul in harmony, the Hymn of Rebirth—a hymn I would not have shared so easily if you had not reached the end of your purification and faith journey, which is the beginning of true knowledge. Such hymns were taught only to those who had purified themselves, not to those still enslaved by the world or struggling with their lower vices, but only to those who had prepared themselves and distanced their minds from worldly illusions. Therefore," says Hermes, "this is not taught openly but kept hidden in silence." This hymn must be used ceremonially at sunrise and sunset. So, my son, stand in an open place facing the west at sunset and make your worship; and similarly, when the sun rises, face the east.And for those who cannot perfect the ritual on all levels, let them stand exposed, with all false beliefs stripped away, standing in the clear light of Heaven, facing the Spiritual Sun, or the Eye of Mind that enlightens our spiritual nature with purified intelligence. Before Hermes sings "The Secret Hymn," he gives a solemn command:

"Now, son, be still!" 

THE SECRET HYMNODY

Let every part of the world hear my hymn! Open, Earth! Let every barrier of the Abyss be removed for me! Be still, Trees! I am about to praise the Lord of Creation, both All and One. Heavens, open, and Winds, be calm; let God's Eternal Sphere receive my words! For I will sing the praise of Him who created everything; who established the Earth and set up Heaven, and commanded the Ocean to provide fresh water for the Earth, for all parts, inhabited or not, to sustain and serve every person; who made Fire to shine for gods and humans for every purpose. Let us all together praise Him, exalted above the Heavens, the Lord of all nature! He is the Eye of Mind; may He accept the praise from my Powers! Powers within me, praise the One and All, sing with my Will, all Powers within me! O blessed Knowledge, illuminated by you, singing through you the Light that only the mind can see, I rejoice in the joy of the Mind. Sing with me praises, all you Powers! Sing praise, my Self-control; sing through me, my Righteousness, the praises of the Righteous; sing, my Sharing-all, the praises of the All; through me sing, Truth, Truth's praises! Sing, O Good, the Good! O Life and Light, from us to you our praises flow! Father, I give You thanks, to You, the Energy of all my Powers; I give You thanks, O God, the Power of all my Energies. Your Reason sings Your praises through me.Take back through me the All into Your Reason—my rational offering! Thus cry the Powers within me. They sing Your praise, O All; they do Your Will. From YOU comes Your Will; to You, the All. Receive from everyone their rational offering. Preserve the All that is within us, O Life; enlighten it, O Light; inspire it, O God! It is Your Mind that guides Your Word, O Creator, Giver of the Spirit to all. For You are God; Your human creation calls out to You through Fire, Air, Earth, Water, and Spirit, through all Your creatures. From Your Aeon I have found Praise-giving; and in Your Will, the goal of my search, I have found Rest.

We can see immediately that this is no ordinary hymn, not like the psalms we are accustomed to, but the gnostic outpouring of a person who has begun to understand their own spiritual dignity and proper place in the universe. This understanding is based on the best traditions of Egyptian theurgy, or the divine energy that commands nature to obey willingly. He is about to speak words 'that are true,' words that move from the true to the True, unhindered. Every aspect of nature will receive these words and pass them on. All elements will rush to serve the person serving God with the lawful liturgy of their whole being. The Earth below, the Heaven above, and the Abyss beneath will open their secret paths to allow the true words of the 'truthful' to reach the Deathless Sphere of the True God—that is, to the Aeon where the True God resides, not just some place in Heaven, Earth, or the Abyss, but to that which transcends them and is the source, preserver, and end of all.Not only the trees of the earth, but also the Trees of Paradise, the Divine Beings living in eternal bliss, will remain in respectful silence as the powerful praise of proper reverence reaches its culmination. The winds of the earth will become still, as will the Winds of Heaven, the Intelligent Breaths within the deepest chambers of man's Greater Mind. This praise is not directed at any specific spirit or god, but to the Lord of All; and those who are devoted to praising God will rejoice that the once-disobedient one has finally, of their own free will, joined in the unending liturgy of nature. 

The hymn celebrates the One and All, the One Lord of all creation, who is both the Creator and the Creation. It is a hymn sung in harmony with the liturgy of the four primal elements: Earth, Air, Water, and Fire—Father Heaven and Mother Earth, Father Fire, and Mother Ocean. Man sings with them, celebrating the glory of their common Lord, the Eye of Mind, which is the True Spiritual Sun, whose eyes are the countless suns in space. This True Sun is the True Light, the Light that only the mind can perceive. The human mind, now illuminated by the Light of Gnosis, becomes akin to the Great Mind, forming a trinity of Good, Light, and Life. Through this trinity, the brilliance of the One and All shines forth in seven Powers or Virtues. These Powers are: Gnosis (Knowledge), Joy, Self-control, Continence, Righteousness, Sharing, and Truth. Each drives out its opposite: Ignorance, Sorrow, Intemperance, Desire, Unrighteousness, Greed, and Error. With the arrival of Truth, the measure of Good is complete, as Truth is joined by Good, Life, and Light.The nature of the persons in the latter trinity is further revealed through praising God as the Energy of all Powers and the Power of all Energies, meaning Light and Life. Light is the masculine energizer, and Life is the feminine nourisher, symbolizing the father-motherhood of God, the Good, and the Logos or Reason of all things. The gnostic psalmist ultimately offers reasonable praise, which is the Song of the Logos—the Reason, the Son of God, the only begotten—singing through the entire nature of man and reconnecting the cosmos, which is himself, back to the source of his Being. This is the culmination of the Great Return, where God's Will becomes the sole will of man. "From You, Your Will; To You, the All." This means that God's Will originates from Him and is also the ultimate goal, as He is the source of His Will, Desire, and Love. His Will is His Spouse, through whom everything exists, the whole universe, the only begotten, whose beginning and end is God Himself, for He is eternal. Another mystic hymn of the period expresses it as: "From You is Father and Through You is Mother," to which we can add, "and To You is Son."

The hymn-singer continues with his 'reasonable offering,' presenting his true self, the logos within him, his angel that always beholds the Face of the Father. He prays that his entire being, his whole cosmos, may be preserved or saved by Life the Mother, illuminated by Light the Father, and inspired by the Great Breath of God that eternally breathes in and out.The man is no longer just a "Letter" or a "Procession of Fate," but a true "Name," a free person, a Word of God, a proper Cosmos, harmonized by aligning his will with God's Will. This Word, or God, or Angel, the Shepherd who provides divine nectar or spiritual food, is the Great Mind or Light, the twin of the Great Soul or Saving Life, both given to us by God the Creator. The man has now become a true Being of Reason, expressing energy through living ideas that influence others and exemplify a virtuous life. From an imperfect man, he has become a perfect Cosmos, living in harmony with the Spirit or Breath of God, the Atman of Indian theosophy. By achieving this true way of breathing and thinking, in tune with the Great Life and Mind, he is now a Man, an Eternity. Reconnected with his true Self, he sings with joy and finds peace in the Motherhood of God. He is reborn, a child Christ, and as he matures, his mother, rejuvenated with eternal youth, will transform from mother to spouse. The remaining hymn in the Trismegistic literature is at the end of "The Perfect Sermon," though the original Greek is lost, and we rely on an often unsatisfactory Old Latin version. This sermon is the longest of the existing Trismegistic writings.The introduction tells us that Hermes, Asclepius, Tat, and Ammon have gathered in a holy place. Here, the three disciples listen respectfully to their master, who gives a long teaching on spiritual knowledge to perfect their understanding. This teaching is rightly called "The Perfect Sermon" or "The Sermon of Initiation."

Asclepius, Tat, and Ammon represent three types of spiritual seekers and aspects of human nature. Asclepius symbolizes the intellectual man, knowledgeable in the arts and sciences of the time. Tat, who is more intuitive than intellectual and younger than Asclepius, is destined to succeed Hermes as a teacher because of his stronger spiritual nature, which enables him to reach higher levels of enlightenment. Ammon represents the practical man, the doer, and leader, rather than a scientist or mystic.

However, it's important not to separate these types too strictly, as all three qualities exist within each of us. True enlightenment comes from the unity and mutual love of these three aspects, much like the disciples James, John, and Peter. They must support and complete each other, and all must be devoted to their teacher, Hermes, who represents the purified mind. Only through Hermes can they receive the teachings of the Great Mind, or the Shepherd.

This idea is summarized in the last sentence of the introduction, which states that when Ammon joined the holy place, completing the sacred group of four, they sat in reverent silence with their souls and minds focused on Hermes. Then, Divine Love began to speak to them.This Divine Love is the same Presence, the Highest Mind, or Shepherd of humanity, which directly enlightens Hermes, our higher mind. However, these immediate, powerful words must be communicated in human language to the three aspects of our lower mind: Asclepius, Tat, and Ammon within us, who are the learners and listeners. After receiving the instruction and leaving the sacred place, the narrative tells us they turned towards the setting sun before singing their hymn of praise. Symbolically, this means that after the mind stops contemplating and its outward energies have been elevated and stilled by the higher mind through Divine Love, all these energies unite in a hymn of praise while still looking towards the diminishing glory of the spiritual setting sun.

At this point, the knowledgeable part within us, represented by Asclepius, who is wise in sciences, arts, and ceremonies, suggests to Tat that they propose to Hermes to offer their prayer to God with added incense and oils. This reflects the mind's tendency to cling to external rituals. But Hermes reminds them of the spiritual essence of their worship. When he hears this, he becomes distressed and says:

"Nay, nay, Asclepius; speak more favorable words! For it is almost like profaning our sacred rites to offer incense and the like to God when praying. For He needs nothing, as He is everything and all things are in Him. Let us worship by giving thanks, for this is the best incense in God's sight when people give thanks to Him."

And so they begin their praise, which we might call "A Hymn of Grace for Gnosis."A HYMN OF THANKS FOR KNOWLEDGE

We thank You, highest and most excellent One! By Your grace, we have received the great light of Your knowledge. O holy Name, worthy of adoration, unique Name by which only God should be blessed through the worship of our Father – You who graciously provide a father's care, love, and whatever virtues are sweeter than these. You have given us sense, reason, and intelligence: sense to feel You, reason to understand You from the appearances of things, and recognition to rejoice in knowing You. Saved by Your divine power, we rejoice that You have revealed Yourself to us in Your fullness. We rejoice that You have chosen to dedicate us, even while still in our bodies, to eternity. For this is the only true festival of praise worthy of man – to know Your Majesty. We know You; by the single sense of our intelligence, we have perceived Your supreme light – O True Life of life, O Fertile Womb that gives birth to all nature! We have known You, O completely filled with the essence of universal nature! We have known You, O Eternal Constancy! This is the entirety of our prayer in worship of Your goodness: we ask that You keep us steadfast in our love of knowing You, and never let us be separated from this way of life. We thank You, grace for grace, goodwill for Your goodwill. As we have learned, the goodwill of God is that "He wishes to be known," and the goodwill of man is his "love of knowing God." The Latin of the next sentence is very unclear, but based on other passages and the context, the unique name of God is "Father."The true worship of God as Father involves religion, piety, and love, as these naturally express our gratitude to God. He generously gives us His care and love, though words cannot fully capture His divine power or the complete satisfaction He provides. God gives us everything abundantly, including our senses, reason, and intelligence, which help us know Him. Our senses help us feel God's presence in everything, reason helps us understand His manifestations in the world, and intelligence, or spiritual intuition, allows us to recognize Him directly.

God's power is His will, which is His goodwill wanting to be known. This purpose of revelation brings joy because it is God showing Himself to humanity in all His fullness, or Pleroma, which is the complete divine cosmos manifested through His only-begotten Son. The 'holy four' rejoice because they have been made holy and serve as priests of the Most High, even while still living in their physical bodies. Their bodies have thus been consecrated as temples of the Son of God, representing eternity.

Therefore, the highest form of praise for humans, in their divine nature, is to understand God's greatness, which is the Aon, or eternity.This knowledge, or Gnosis, is achieved through the unified sense of intelligence. It is not attained by the senses or the mind alone, but by a higher means that combines both, resulting in self-knowledge, the Light of God, or the Overmind of all things. It is also the Life of God, or the Over-Soul of all things, described as the "Fertile Womb that gives birth to every nature." This is the Gnosis of the Divine as the Pleroma, or Fullness, encompassing the universal nature conceived from God Himself.

Finally, God is praised for being known as Eternal Constancy, Stability, Duration, Unchangeableness, and Sameness. This beautiful gnostic thanksgiving ends with a prayer that the Eternal Constancy, or God in His eternal nature, will keep them constant in Pure and Single Love, the Love of knowing God. These hymns are noble and worthy of the best in humanity and true worshippers of God. If only we had a collection of such psalms, as likely once existed in this excellent community of God's servants and Gnostic liturgists. Unfortunately, while time has preserved much of the classical writers—often more than needed—Providence has kept from us most of the beautiful works of man's gnostic genius, perhaps because the world was not ready to appreciate them.

Therefore, we must follow the path of the Hermeses of the past and once again create "fair things." What man has achieved once, he can achieve again, and if I am not mistaken, the times are becoming ripe for such true poetry once more.We no longer have any Hymns of Hermes to delight our readers' hearts, as we hope they once did. However, we will share another hymn that is so similar in nature that it might as well have been written by a follower of the Trismegistic faith. This hymn is called "A Song of Praise to the Aeon." It is said to have been inscribed on a "secret tablet" by an unknown member of a forgotten order, possibly from one of the Communities of the Aeon—the Highest and Supercelestial One. Philo of Byblos, in the second half of the first century AD, mentioned that these communities existed in Phoenicia and likely also in Egypt (i, 403). The text is found in the Greek Magic Papyri.

A SONG OF PRAISE TO THE AEON

Hail to You, All-Cosmos of ethereal Spirit! Hail to You, Spirit, who extends from Heaven to Earth, and from the Earth in the middle of the Cosmos to the depths of the Abyss! Hail to You, Spirit, who enters me, clings to me, or parts from me according to God's will and goodness! Hail to You, Beginning and End of Nature that nothing can move! Hail to You, tireless Liturgy of Nature's Elements! Hail to You, Illumination of the Solar Beam that shines to serve the world! Hail to You, Disk of the night-shining Moon, that shines unevenly! Hail, all Spirits of the ethereal Statues of the Gods! Hail to all of You, whom holy Brothers and holy Sisters praise! O Mighty Spirit, most powerful and incomprehensible Configuration of the Cosmos, hail! Celestial, ethereal, inter-ethereal, water-like, earth-like, fire-like, air-like, like light, like darkness, shining like the Stars—moist, hot, cold Spirit!I praise You, God of gods, who continually restores the Universe, and who keeps the Abyss hidden on its unseen Throne of Stability. You separate Heaven and Earth, cover the Heavens with Your golden, everlasting wings, and make the Earth stable on everlasting Thrones. You suspend the Ether in the high Heavens and scatter the Air with Your moving Winds, making the Water swirl in circles. You raise the fiery Whirlwind and create thunder, lightning, rain, and earthquakes. O God of Ages! You are mighty, Lord God, Master of All!

The Aeon is the Invisible Intelligible Universe, the All-Universe of Aethereal Spirit or Quintessence, distinct from the Sensible Universe of the four Great Elements: pure Fire, Air, Water, and Earth, unlike our mixed elements. The reader only needs to compare the opening and closing sentences of "The Secret Hymnody" with the first paragraph of our hymn to see that they share the same ideas. Heaven, Earth, and the Abyss are the three worlds through which the Spirit, like Vishnu in the Puranas, takes "three strides." This Spirit, the Great Breath of Life, is the out-breath and in-breath of man's many lives. When the Spirit breathes out, he is born, transitioning from death to life, and also from life to death; for the life of the body is the death of the soul. When the Spirit breathes in, he becomes dead to bodily things but alive to the things of the soul. All this happens "according to the Will of God in the goodness of His heart." The Will of God is the Energy or Effective Working of God, surpassing all human ideas of Love, driven by the goodness of His heart, which always wills the good of all beings, for the Heart of God is Goodness Itself, the Aeon.The Aeon is neither a beginning nor an end, but both; it represents an eternal cycle where everything starts and ends at the same point, continuously revolving in an unending dance. The Aeon fuels all existence and is the source of the Universe's mighty whirlpool, as it is the ultimate atom of all atoms and their combinations. It is the light source for all celestial bodies, including the Sun, Moon, and countless stars. The Aeon is composed of light and life, making it the parent of all spirits, whose true forms are like fiery celestial spheres.

In this community of gnostic believers, they rightly honor all gods, viewing them as the true saints of Heaven, while striving to achieve holiness on Earth. The Aeon is the ultimate example for everything, embodying the eternal structure of the Universe with its elements and light. It exists in three forms, reminiscent of the threefold nature of reality in Indian philosophy: moist, hot, and cold; black, red, and white; Tamas, Rajas, and Sattva.

The supreme task of the God of Gods is to continuously restore and renew the Universe in its three aspects: height, middle, and depth, akin to the layers of a cosmic germ-cell. Over this, the Spirit hovers with golden wings, like a great bird perpetually hatching the Egg of the Universe.From this contemplation, the constant creation of everything emerges. Since all beings come from the Aeon, each one, in their cosmic nature, is also an Aeon. Therefore, the Aeon is the God of Aeons. He is the God of millions of years, months, and days, whether these time periods belong to the earth or the universe, making Him the God of all existences and the Eternity of all things. Here, we conclude our little hymn-book, hoping that some may sing in response to the Hymns of Heathen Hermes even in this twentieth century of Christian grace. After all, perhaps Hermes and Christ are not as unfamiliar to each other as traditional theological prejudice suggests.

## Section 1: Introduction

For those studying the origins of Christianity, no period of Western history is more fascinating and crucial than the first century. Yet, there is still relatively little clear and reliable information about it. It's a lasting regret that no non-Christian writer from the first century had the foresight to record any information about the birth and growth of what would become the dominant religion of the Western world.

Equally disappointing is the lack of detailed information about the general social and religious conditions of that time. The historians of the next century were mostly interested in the rulers and wars of the Empire. Even in political history, while we can verify the public acts of Emperors through records and inscriptions, we often find only prejudice, scandal, and speculation regarding their private actions and motives.

The political actions of Emperors and their officials provide only a faint glimpse of the general social conditions and offer no insight into the religious conditions, except where these intersected with politics. Trying to reconstruct the religious life of the time from Imperial acts and documents is as futile as trying to understand the intimate religious beliefs of today from statute books or reports of Parliamentary debates.

The Roman histories we've been accustomed to do not help us recreate the environment into which Paul introduced the new faith in Asia Minor, Greece, and Rome, or where it already existed in the southeastern Mediterranean regions. We can only become aware of the religious associations and private cults of that period by painstakingly piecing together isolated scraps of information and fragments of inscriptions. We don't have very direct information about what happened in these associations, guilds, and brotherhoods, but we have enough evidence to regret the lack of more knowledge.

This field is difficult to explore but very interesting, and it's unfortunate that so little work has been done on it. Also, the work that has been done is mostly not available to English readers. A list of books and articles on Greek and Roman religious associations can be found in the bibliographical note at the end of this essay. However, if we want an overview of the state of religion in the first century, we don't have a reliable guide. Few works cover this topic, and those that do focus mainly on Christianity, while we want to learn about the non-Christian religious world.

For example, if you look at general history works like Merivale's "History of the Romans under the Empire" (London; last ed. 1865), you'll find a description of the state of religion up to Nero's death in chapter four, but it won't provide much insight. Similarly, if you read Hermann Schiller's "History of the Roman Empire under the Reign of Nero" (Berlin; 1872), you'll find reasons to doubt the common beliefs about Nero's supposed monstrous crimes. You could also read G. H. Lewes' article "Was Nero a Monster?" (Cornhill Magazine; July, 1863) for more on this topic. The understanding of religion and philosophy of the time is much clearer now than what Merivale provided, but it still feels vague and unsatisfactory. We still feel disconnected from the personal lives of the philosophers and religious figures of the first century.

When we look at recent Church history writers, they focus mainly on the interaction between the Christian Church and the Roman Empire, only occasionally providing the information we seek. On this topic, C.J. Neumann’s detailed study "Der romische Staat und die allgemeine Kirche bis auf Diocletian" (Leipzig, 1890) is interesting, and Prof. W.M. Ramsay’s "The Church in the Roman Empire before A.D. 170" (London, 1893) is notable because he tries to interpret Roman history using New Testament documents, whose dates are highly debated.

But, you might ask, what does all this have to do with Apollonius of Tyana? The answer is simple: Apollonius lived in the first century and was involved with these religious groups, colleges, and guilds. Understanding these groups would give us context for much of his life and could help us comprehend why he undertook certain tasks. If it were only about Apollonius's life and efforts, we might understand why there hasn't been much effort to explore this area. Since the fourth century, Apollonius has been viewed unfavorably by most people, with many seeing him as not just a charlatan, but even as an anti-Christ.

It is surprising that we don't have more thorough research on the religious groups and orders that could shed light on the early development of Christianity, both in the Pauline communities and in the groups later considered heretical. While some might say that this information is simply unavailable, there is still much more that could be done. By combining research from various historical sources, we could provide non-specialists with a general understanding of the religious conditions of the time. This would help counter the common tendency to dismiss all non-Jewish or non-Christian religious efforts in the Roman Empire of the first century as immoral.

A reader might argue that social and religious conditions back then were very poor, as illustrated by Apollonius spending much of his life trying to reform the Empire's institutions and cults. Our response is that, while there was certainly much in need of reform (and when isn't there?), it is neither fair nor useful to judge the people of that time by an ideal moral standard or by comparing them to our own perceived virtues and knowledge. We do not claim there was nothing to reform; rather, we argue that the sweeping accusations of depravity against that era do not hold up under unbiased investigation.

In fact, there was a lot of good material to build upon, which is evident in the emergence of Christianity itself.The Roman Empire was at the peak of its power. This success wouldn't have been possible without the many competent administrators and honorable men in the ruling class. Additionally, religious freedom was generally ensured, and any persecution, such as during the reigns of Nero and Domitian, was driven by political rather than religious reasons.

For example, the persecution of Christians under Nero was aimed at those seen as Jewish political revolutionaries. Similarly, philosophers were imprisoned or exiled not for their philosophical beliefs but because some of them supported the restoration of the Republic, which was seen as threatening to the Emperor's authority. Apollonius, however, was a strong supporter of monarchical rule. Therefore, when philosophers were banished or imprisoned, it wasn't a widespread persecution of philosophy across the Empire. Most philosophers stayed out of politics, especially those from religio-philosophical schools.

## Section 2: The Religious Associations of the First Century

When it comes to religion in the first century, state cults and national institutions were generally in poor condition. Apollonius dedicated significant time and effort to reviving and purifying these religious practices. Indeed, the strength of traditional state-run religious institutions had long faded, where practices had become routine and lacked genuine devotion.

However, rather than a decline in religious life, people increasingly turned to private cults to satisfy their spiritual needs. This surge of religious enthusiasm, primarily from the East, saw many people eagerly participating in new religious practices. While there were certainly excesses and abuses by modern standards, many found fulfillment in these movements. Apart from those cults that were clearly harmful, these popular religious fervors were similar to the enthusiasms seen today in groups like the Shakers or during general revival meetings.

It is important to note that not all private cults and religious associations were extreme or limited to certain social classes. There were numerous religious brotherhoods, communities, and clubs—such as the thiasi, erani, and orgeones—that catered to a variety of people. Additionally, there were mutual benefit societies, burial clubs, and dining groups, which can be seen as precursors to modern organizations like the Masons and Oddfellows. These associations were private not only because they were independent of the State but also because their activities were often kept secret, which likely explains the lack of detailed historical records about them.

Among them are not only the lower forms of mystery cults of various kinds but also the more significant ones, such as the Phrygian, Bacchic, Isiac, and Mithraic Mysteries, which were widespread throughout the Empire. The famous Eleusinian Mysteries were still supported by the State but, as a state cult, were much more routine. Additionally, it should not be assumed that the major types of mystery cults mentioned were uniform within themselves. There were various levels and grades within them, and probably many forms of each tradition, ranging from good to bad to indifferent.

For example, every respectable citizen of Athens was expected to be initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries, so the tests could not have been very strict. On the other hand, Dr. K. H. E. De Jong, in his work "De Apuleio Isiacorum Mysteriorum Teste" (Leyden; 1900), shows that in one form of the Isiac Mysteries, candidates were invited to initiation through dreams, indicating they had to be psychically receptive before being accepted. Thus, there was a wide range of religious practices between the most popular and undisciplined private cults and the highest forms that could only be approached through philosophical discipline and training.

The higher aspects of these mystery institutions inspired the best minds of antiquity, receiving high praise from the greatest thinkers and writers of Greece and Rome. This suggests that the educated found in these mysteries the religious fulfillment they needed, not only for those who couldn't reach pure reason but also for those who had ascended so high in reason that they glimpsed something beyond.The official religious practices were notoriously unable to provide this satisfaction, and were only tolerated by the educated as a means to help the general population and preserve the traditional life of the city or state.

It was widely agreed that the most virtuous people in Greece were members of the Pythagorean schools, both men and women. After their founder's death, the Pythagoreans seemed to gradually merge with the Orphic communities, where the "Orphic life" became synonymous with a life of purity and self-denial. We also know that the Orphics, and therefore the Pythagoreans, were actively involved in reforming the Baccho-Eleusinian rites, and they seem to have revived the pure elements of the Bacchic cult with the reinstitution of the Iacchic mysteries.

It is clear that such disciplined and thoughtful individuals would not have been satisfied with a low form of worship. Their influence spread widely in Bacchic circles, as evidenced by Euripides, who wrote these words for a chorus of Bacchic initiates: "Clad in white robes I speed away from the birth of mortal men, and never again approach the vessel of death, for I have stopped consuming food that housed a soul."[^1]

Such words could easily be spoken by a Brahman or Buddhist ascetic, eager to escape the cycle of rebirth (Samsara). Therefore, these individuals cannot justly be lumped together with drunken revelers—the common stereotype of a Bacchic group.

Some may argue that Euripides, the Pythagoreans, and the Orphics provide no evidence for the first century, and that any goodness in such schools and communities had disappeared long before. However, all evidence contradicts this objection.

Philo, writing around 25 A.D., tells us that in his time, there were many groups of men who led religious lives. These men gave up their property, left the world behind, and dedicated themselves entirely to seeking wisdom and practicing virtue. They were spread far and wide across the world. In his work, "On the Contemplative Life," he states:

^"This natural class of men can be found in many parts of the inhabited world, both in Greek and non-Greek regions, sharing in the perfect good. In Egypt, there are many of them in every province, especially around Alexandria."

This is a significant statement, because if so many people were dedicated to religious life at that time, it shows that the era was not entirely corrupt. However, it should not be assumed that all these communities were exactly the same or had the same origin, especially not that they were all Therapeut or Essene.

One only needs to consider the various origins of the doctrines held by the many schools grouped together as Gnostic, as explained in my recent work, "Fragments of a Faith Forgotten," and to look at the beautiful writings of the Hermetic schools, to see that the pursuit of religious and philosophical life was widespread and varied in the first century. We do not believe, however, that the origins of the Therapeut communities of Philo and the Essenes of Philo and Josephus can be traced to Orphic and Pythagorean influence. The exact origin is still beyond historical research, and we do not believe in exaggerating one element as the universal source.

When we consider the existence of many scattered communities in the first century and study the imperfect but important records of numerous schools and brotherhoods that interacted closely with early Christianity, we can't help but feel that there was a strong religious influence throughout the Empire. Our main challenge is that these groups often kept to themselves and rarely left records of their practices and beliefs, or if they did, those records have been lost or destroyed. Therefore, we mostly rely on superficial evidence. However, this lack of detailed records doesn't justify denying or ignoring their existence and efforts. A history that claims to depict the times is incomplete if it leaves out this crucial aspect.

Apollonius lived among such communities, but his biographer, Philostratus, seems largely unaware of their significance. Philostratus appreciates the philosophical aspects of court life but lacks an understanding of religious life. The biography of Apollonius only indirectly sheds light on these fascinating communities, but even occasional glimpses are valuable in such obscurity.

If we could see through Apollonius's eyes and experience what he saw nineteen hundred years ago, we could recover a highly interesting part of history. Apollonius traveled through many regions where the new faith was spreading, lived in many of them for years, and was closely connected with various mystic communities in Egypt, Arabia, and Syria.

Surely, he must have visited some of the earliest Christian communities and even spoken with some of the "disciples of the Lord." Yet, there is no mention of this, not a single piece of information about these encounters in the records we have. Surely, he must have met with Paul, if not elsewhere, then in Rome in 66 AD, the year Paul was reportedly beheaded, and the same year he had to leave because of an edict banishing philosophers.

## Section 3: India and Greece

There is, however, another reason why Apollonius is important to us. He was a great admirer of Indian wisdom. This opens up a subject of wide interest: What influence, if any, did Brahmanism and Buddhism have on Western thought during these early years? Some strongly assert they had a significant impact, while others strongly deny any influence at all. Therefore, there is no undeniable evidence on the subject.

Just as some attribute the formation of the Essene and Therapeut communities to Pythagorean influence, others attribute their origin to Buddhist teachings. Some even suggest that the general teachings of Christ have a Buddhist source within a Jewish monotheistic context. Moreover, some believe that even before Greece's direct contact with India through Alexander's conquests, Indian thought strongly influenced Greek philosophy through Pythagoras, leaving a lasting impact.

The question cannot be settled quickly with a simple yes or no; it requires extensive knowledge of history, careful study of scattered and incomplete clues, and a keen understanding of indirect evidence, as there is no direct, conclusive evidence. We do not claim to have such high qualifications, and our goal is just to provide some general insights into the topic.

The ancient Greeks clearly stated that Pythagoras went to India, but since this claim comes from later Neo-Pythagorean and Neo-Platonic writers, it is argued that these accounts might have been influenced by the travels of Apollonius of Tyana, or even that Apollonius himself might have started these rumors in his Life of Pythagoras.

However, the strong similarities between Pythagorean practices and Indo-Aryan thought make us hesitant to completely dismiss the possibility that Pythagoras visited ancient India. Even if we can't fully support the idea of direct contact, it's worth considering that Pherecydes, Pythagoras's teacher, might have known some key ideas from Vedic teachings. Pherecydes taught in Ephesus but was likely Persian, and it's believable that a learned Asian teaching a mystical philosophy based on the idea of rebirth could have had some indirect, if not direct, knowledge of Indo-Aryan thought.

At this time, Persia was closely connected with India. Around the death of Pythagoras, during the reign of Darius, son of Hystaspes, at the end of the 6th century and beginning of the 5th century BCE, the Persian general Scylax led an expedition down the Indus River. Herodotus tells us that during Darius's reign, India (specifically the Punjab) was the twentieth satrapy of the Persian Empire. Additionally, Indian troops fought alongside Xerxes' forces, invading Thessaly and fighting at Plataea.

From Alexander the Great's time onward, there was direct and ongoing contact between India and the kingdoms of his successors. Many Greeks wrote about India, but their accounts provide only vague insights into the systematic thoughts of Indian philosophers. The Brahmins, who held their sacred texts in great secrecy, would not have allowed the Greeks (referred to as Yavanas in Indian records) to read them. The Greeks, considered outsiders or "Mlechchhas" by the Aryas, could only gather information through external observation.

During this period, Buddhism was the dominant religious movement in India. Unlike the rigid caste and racial distinctions upheld by Brahmanical tradition, Buddhism promoted an inclusive religious message to all classes and races, both within and outside India. This facilitated more direct contact of ideas between India and Greece. For example, in the mid-3rd century BCE, we know from Ashoka's thirteenth edict that this Buddhist Emperor of India, often compared to Constantine of the East, sent missionaries to Antiochus II of Syria, Ptolemy II of Egypt, Antigonus Gonatas of Macedonia, Magas of Cyrene, and Alexander II of Epirus.

In a land with such imperfect records, the clear and undeniable evidence from India makes it even more surprising that we have no direct testimony of significant missionary activity on our side. Although it is unsafe to generalize due to the lack of information from Greek sources, our general knowledge of the times suggests that these pioneers of the Dharma in the West did not create a major public impact. It is likely that these Buddhist monks had no effect on the rulers or the people.

However, was their mission completely unsuccessful, and did Buddhist missionary efforts towards the West end with them? This question remains hidden within the obscurity of religious communities. We cannot completely agree with those who claim that the ascetic communities in Syria and Egypt were founded by these Buddhist missionaries. Even in Greece, there were Pythagorean and even earlier Orphic communities.

We believe Pythagoras developed what was already there rather than creating something new. If such communities existed in Greece, it is even more reasonable to assume they existed in Syria, Arabia, and Egypt, where people were more inclined towards religious practices than the skeptical and fun-loving Greeks. It is plausible that Buddhist teachings might have found an appreciative audience in these communities, but it is still remarkable that they left no clear trace of their influence.

Nevertheless, there was always an open line of communication between India and the Empire of Alexander's successors, both by sea and by the great caravan routes. It is even possible to speculate that if we could access a catalog of the great Alexandrian library, we might find Indian manuscripts among the other scrolls and parchments of various nations' scriptures. In fact, some phrases in the oldest Hermetic literature closely resemble phrases in the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita, suggesting that the writers might have been familiar with these Brahmanical texts. The Hermetic literature originated in Egypt and dates back to at least the first century A.D., if not earlier.

Even more striking is the similarity between the mystical metaphysics of the Gnostic teacher Basilides, who lived at the end of the first and beginning of the second century A.D., and Vedantic ideas. Both the Hermetic and Basilidean schools, along with their predecessors, practiced strict self-discipline and deep philosophical study, making them likely to welcome any philosopher or mystic student from the East.

However, we do not believe that direct physical contact is necessary to explain the similarity of ideas or phrasing. For instance, while there are many similarities between the teachings of the Buddha's Dharma and the Gospel of Christ, and both are characterized by a spirit of love and gentleness, it is not necessary to attribute these similarities to direct transmission.

For other schools and teachers, similar conditions will produce similar outcomes; similar efforts and aspirations will lead to similar ideas, experiences, and responses. We believe this isn't just a general trend but is specifically guided by those dedicated to religious matters in the world. Therefore, we don't need to focus too much on physical transmission or proving copying. The human mind operates similarly across different regions and times, sharing a common ground for experiences and ideas. The valuable teachings originate from the same source, and those who spread them do not discriminate based on race or creed.

Although proving direct influence of Indian thought on the religious communities and philosophical schools of the Graeco-Roman Empire through historical records is challenging, it's highly probable that even before Apollonius's time, there was some knowledge of Vedanta and Dharma in Greece. As for Apollonius himself, despite the exaggerations about him, his main goal seemed to be spreading some of the wisdom he acquired from India among the religious groups and institutions of the Empire.

At the end of the first century and during the first half of the second century, we find ideas in the Hermetic and Gnostic schools that remind us of the theosophy of the Upanishads or the reasoned ethics of the Suttas [i.e., sutras]. Considering this, it's highly probable that Apollonius visited such schools and possibly discussed Indian wisdom there. Moreover, his influence might have lingered in these circles for a long time.

For instance, Plotinus (a major figure in Neo-Platonism), was so fascinated by Indian wisdom that in 242 he joined Emperor Gordian's ill-fated expedition to the East, hoping to reach India. However, after the expedition failed and the Emperor was assassinated, Plotinus had to return, forever disappointed.

It's important to note that Apollonius did not aim to spread Indian philosophy in the same manner that missionaries preach the Gospel. Instead, he tried to help his listeners in the way best suited to them. He didn't start by condemning their beliefs as false and destructive, nor did he insist they adopt his own ideas for their eternal welfare. Rather, he aimed to clarify and enhance what they already believed and practiced. It's not hard to believe that some strong power supported him in his extensive and global efforts. It's a fascinating question for those who look beyond appearances to consider how both Paul and Apollonius might have been guided and supported in their missions.

The day hasn't yet come when people in the West can look at the idea without bias that, from a certain perspective, both Paul and Apollonius could be considered "disciples of the Lord" in a true sense. This is despite their tasks seeming very different and even oppositional to traditional theology. However, there is a growing number of thoughtful people today who won't be shocked by this idea but will welcome it as a sign of the rise of true righteousness, which will enlighten the various paths of human religion more than the self-righteousness of any exclusive religious group. We ask the reader to consider Apollonius and his actions in this spirit of openness and tolerance, as well as the lives and deeds of all those who have tried to help others worldwide.

## Section 4: The Apollonius of Early Opinion

Apollonius of Tyana was the most famous philosopher of the Graeco-Roman world in the first century and spent most of his long life purifying the many cults of the Empire and educating its religious leaders. Except for Christ, no more interesting figure appears in early Western history. Many different and often contradictory opinions exist about Apollonius because the account of his life that has survived is more like a romantic story than a straightforward history.

It is somewhat expected, as Apollonius, aside from his public teaching, had a private life that even his favorite disciple was not part of. He traveled to distant lands, disappearing from the world for years. He entered the most sacred temples and exclusive communities, but what he said or did there remained a mystery, often becoming the subject of fantastical stories by those who did not understand.

This study aims to present a brief overview of the problem posed by the records and traditions of the famous Tyanean's life. Before discussing the "Life of Apollonius" by Flavius Philostratus, written at the beginning of the third century, we must provide an overview of references to Apollonius among classical writers and Church Fathers, as well as a brief history of the literature on the subject in more recent times and the debates about his life over the last four centuries.

First, regarding classical and patristic authors: Lucian, a witty writer from the first half of the second century, makes a pupil of a disciple of Apollonius the subject of one of his satires. Appuleius, contemporary with Lucian, ranks Apollonius alongside Moses, Zoroaster, and other famous ancient magi.

Around the same time, in a work titled "Questions and Answers to the Orthodox," once attributed to Justin Martyr from the second quarter of the second century, we find the following statement: "Question 24: If God is the creator and ruler of the universe, how do the consecrated objects of Apollonius hold power in various aspects of creation? As we observe, they mitigate the force of the waves, the power of the winds, the invasions of pests, and the attacks of wild animals."

Dion Cassius, in his history written between A.D. 211-222, mentions that Emperor Caracalla (reigned 211-216) honored Apollonius with a chapel or monument. Around this time (216), Philostratus wrote the Life of Apollonius at the request of Domna Julia, Caracalla's mother. This document will be our main focus later on.

Lampridius, active around the mid-third century, informs us that Emperor Alexander Severus (reigned 222-235) placed a statue of Apollonius in his shrine alongside those of Christ, Abraham, and Orpheus.

Vopiscus, writing in the last decade of the third century, tells us that Emperor Aurelian (reigned 270-275) promised to build a temple to Apollonius after seeing a vision of him during the siege of Tyana. Vopiscus describes Apollonius as a highly respected and renowned sage, an ancient philosopher, and a true friend of the gods, even suggesting that he was a manifestation of a deity. Vopiscus praises Apollonius for his holiness, reverence, and godliness, attributing miraculous acts to him, such as reviving the dead and performing extraordinary deeds.

Vopiscus was so enthusiastic about Apollonius that he promised to write a short biography in Latin, so everyone could know about his actions and words, as the existing accounts were only in Greek. However, Vopiscus did not fulfill this promise.

We know that around this time, Soterichus and Nichomachus wrote biographies of Apollonius, and shortly after, Tascius Victorianus, using Nichomachus's papers, also wrote a biography. Unfortunately, none of these biographies have survived.During the late third century and early fourth century, Porphyry and Iamblichus wrote about Pythagoras and his school, both citing Apollonius as a source. It's likely that the first 30 sections of Iamblichus' work were derived from Apollonius.

Now, we encounter an event that brought Apollonius into the realm of Christian debate, where his character has been discussed ever since. Around 305, Hierocles, a philosopher and governor of Palmyra, Bithynia, and Alexandria, wrote a critique of Christianity titled "A Truthful Address to the Christians," or simply "The Truth-lover." He largely drew from the works of Celsus and Porphyry, but he introduced a new argument by comparing the miracles attributed to Apollonius with those claimed by Christians to prove their Master's divinity.

Hierocles used Philostratus' "Life of Apollonius" for this argument. In response, Eusebius of Caesarea wrote a rebuttal titled "Contra Hieroclem," which still exists today. Eusebius acknowledged that Apollonius was wise and virtuous but argued that there wasn't enough evidence for the miraculous deeds attributed to him. Even if they did occur, Eusebius claimed they were the work of demons, not God. Eusebius' treatise is notable for its critical examination of Philostratus' statements. Had he applied the same scrutiny to Church documents, for which he was the first historian, future generations would have greatly benefited.

Eusebius, like many other defenders of Christianity, was biased; he couldn’t be fair when it came to anything related to Christianity. He would have thought it blasphemous to question the documents describing the "miracles" of Jesus. However, the issue of "miracle" remains the same, as Hierocles pointed out. This issue re-emerged in the sixteenth century when the idea that the "Devil" was behind all miracles except those of the Church lost credibility with the advancement of scientific thought.

The miraculous stories in the Life of Apollonius were so problematic that they led to the new theory that these stories were plagiarized from the life of Jesus. Apollonius's life was considered a pagan copy of Jesus's life. Eusebius and his contemporaries were unaware of this, living in times when such claims could have been easily disproven.

There is no evidence in Philostratus's writings that he knew about Jesus's life, and despite Baur's appealing "tendency-writing" theory, Philostratus fails as a plagiarist of the Gospel story. Philostratus writes about a good and wise man with a teaching mission, adorned with wonder stories passed down and elaborated by admirers, but not the story of a divine being fulfilling world prophecy.

Lactantius, writing around 315, also critiqued Hierocles’s work, which contained some relevant criticisms. The Church Father noted that Hierocles listed many of the inner teachings of Christianity, suggesting he might have once been part of the same training. Lactantius argues that it is pointless for Hierocles to claim that Apollonius performed greater deeds than Jesus. Christians believe Jesus is God not because of his miracles, but because his actions fulfilled the prophecies. Lactantius understood better than Eusebius that miracles alone are a weak proof.

Arnobius, Lactantius's teacher, writing at the end of the third century, before the controversy, simply groups Apollonius with other magicians like Zoroaster, as mentioned by Appuleius.

After the controversy, opinions among the Church Fathers varied. By the end of the fourth century, John Chrysostom harshly criticized Apollonius, calling him a deceiver and claiming his life stories were entirely fictional. In contrast, Jerome, at the same time, had a more favorable view, noting that Apollonius always sought to learn and improve.

In the early fifth century, Augustine mocked any comparison between Apollonius and Jesus but acknowledged that Apollonius's character was far superior to that of Jove in terms of virtue.

Around the same time, Isidorus of Pelusium, who died in 450, denied claims that Apollonius consecrated many places around the world for the safety of the inhabitants. This denial contrasts with the views expressed by Pseudo-Justin. In the second century, the author of "Questions and Answers to the Orthodox" couldn't simply deny the issue; he had to acknowledge it and argue that the Devil was responsible.

The Church Fathers' claim that Apollonius used magic, while untrained Christians could heal with just a word, isn't convincing to an unbiased critic. There's no evidence that Apollonius used magic for his miracles; both Apollonius and his biographer Philostratus strongly denied these accusations.

A few years later, Sidonius Apollinaris, the Bishop of Claremont, spoke highly of Apollonius. Sidonius translated the "Life of Apollonius" into Latin for Leon, a counselor to King Euric. In a letter to his friend, Sidonius wrote: "Read about a man who, aside from religion, resembles you in many ways. He was sought after by the rich but never sought riches himself, loved wisdom and despised gold, was frugal even at feasts, wore linen while others wore purple, and remained austere amidst luxury. In short, no historian may find a philosopher in ancient times who lived a life as admirable as Apollonius." This shows that even among the Church Fathers, opinions were divided, while philosophers consistently praised Apollonius.

Ammianus Marcellinus, known as "the last subject of Rome who wrote a secular history in Latin," and a friend of Julian the philosopher-emperor, refers to Tyanean as "that most renowned philosopher." A few years later, Eunapius, a student of Chrysanthius (one of Julian’s teachers), writing at the end of the fourth century, said that Apollonius was more than a philosopher; he was "a middle term between gods and men."

Apollonius was not only a follower of Pythagorean philosophy but also perfectly demonstrated its divine and practical aspects. Philostratus should have titled his biography "The Sojourning of a God among Men." This seemingly exaggerated view might be explained by the fact that Eunapius belonged to a school familiar with the achievements attributed to Apollonius. In the fifth century, Volusian, a proconsul of Africa from an old Roman family still devoted to the old religion, almost worshipped Apollonius of Tyana as a supernatural being.

Even after the decline of philosophy, Cassiodorus, who spent his final years in a monastery, spoke of Apollonius as the "renowned philosopher." Among Byzantine writers, the monk George Syncellus, in the eighth century, often mentioned Apollonius without any criticism and stated that he was the first and most remarkable of all the famous people who appeared under the Empire. Tzetzes, a critic and grammarian, also referred to Apollonius as "all-wise and a fore-knower of all things."

In the eleventh century, the monk Xiphilinus, in a note to his summary of Dion Cassius's history, called Apollonius a clever trickster and magician. However, Cedrenus in the same century referred to Apollonius as a "skilled Pythagorean philosopher" and described several examples of his powers in Byzantium. According to Nicetas, even as late as the thirteenth century, there were bronze doors in Byzantium, previously consecrated by Apollonius, which had to be melted down because they had become objects of superstition for Christians.

If Philostratus's work had disappeared with the rest of the Lives, the above would be all we would know about Apollonius. Although this information is limited, it is enough to show that, aside from theological bias, ancient opinions were largely in favor of Apollonius.

There are two translations in Latin, one in Italian, one in Danish, all included with Philostratus' "Life," and one translation in French printed separately ("Discourse of Eusebius, Bishop of Caesarea, on the Miracles attributed by Pagans to Apollonius of Tyana," translated by Cousin, Paris, 1584, 12mo, 135 pages).

The Church Father, however, with the exclusiveness typical of the Judeo-Christian view, omits Moses from the list of Magi.

The phrase "ti theun te kai anthrupoy meson" refers to someone who has reached a level superior to humans but not yet equal to the gods. This was called by the Greeks the "daemonian" order. The term "daemon" has been downgraded due to sectarian bias, and its original meaning is now commonly referred to as "angel." Plato mentioned in the Symposium that "all that is daemonian is between God and man." However, I have not found the evidence to support this claim. Notable philosopher Eunapius, in his "Lives of the Philosophers," and other sources such as "Chronicon" and "Chronographia," also discuss this concept. The term "adept" is used to describe someone who has power over the elements.

## Section 5: Texts, Translations, and Literature

We will now look at the texts, translations, and literature on this topic in more recent times. Apollonius re-emerged in public memory after the Dark Ages, but with negative associations. The old debate between Hierocles and Eusebius was revived, shifting the discussion from philosophy and history to religious controversy.

Aldus was hesitant to print Philostratus' text and only did so in 1501 with Eusebius' text as an appendix, stating that "the antidote might accompany the poison." Alongside it, a Latin translation by the Florentine Rinucci was published. In addition to the Latin version, the sixteenth century also saw Italian and French translations.

The first edition by Aldus was replaced a century later by Morel's edition, which was then succeeded a century after that by Olearius' edition. Nearly a century and a half later, Kayser's edition (the first critical text) replaced Olearius'. Kayser's latest edition includes the most recent critical apparatus. Detailed information about the manuscripts can be found in Kayser's Latin Prefaces.

We will now try to provide an overview of the general literature on the subject, so the reader can observe the varying opinions over time. If the general reader finds this tedious and prefers more engaging content, they can skip this section. However, if the reader enjoys the mystic path and dislikes contentious debates, they may sympathize with the author, who has had to review numerous works spanning the last century and several from previous centuries before forming an opinion.

Sectarian bias against Apollonius is evident in almost all opinions before the nineteenth century. Among books specifically addressing this topic, the works of Abbe Dupin and de Tillemont are harsh criticisms of the Philosopher of Tyana, defending the exclusivity of Christian miracles, while the works of Abbe Houtteville and Luderwald, though less aggressive, follow a similar stance. An anonymous writer from the eighteenth century took a different approach by categorizing the miracles of the Jesuits and other Monastic Orders alongside those of Apollonius, calling them all fake, while asserting that only the miracles of Jesus were genuine.

However, both Bacon and Voltaire spoke highly of Apollonius, and even a century before Voltaire, the English Deist Charles Blount defended Apollonius against widespread criticism; unfortunately, his work was quickly suppressed. Amidst the eighteenth-century debate over miracles, it is refreshing to note Herzog's brief treatise, which attempts to outline the philosophy and religious life of Apollonius. Sadly, no one followed Herzog's open-minded approach during that contentious era.

The earlier literature on the subject is frankly not worth reading, as the problem could not be calmly analyzed during that time. It began with the misguided Hierocles-Eusebius controversy, which was insignificant (since miracle-working is common to all great teachers, not just Apollonius or Jesus), and was further complicated by the rise of Encyclopaedism and the rationalism of the Revolutionary period. The miracle debate didn’t end even in the last century, but it no longer dominates the discussion, and a clearer perspective is emerging.

To clarify the rest of our summary, we have listed at the end of this essay the titles of works published since the beginning of the nineteenth century, in chronological order. This list includes an English translation (Berwick's), an Italian translation (Lancetti's), a French translation (Chassang's), and two German translations (Jacobs' and Baltzer's).

E. Berwick's translation is the only English version. In his Preface, the author argues that while the miraculous elements in the Life are false, the rest of the work is worth careful attention. Reading it won't harm the Christian religion since it doesn't mention the Life of Christ, and the miracles described are similar to those attributed to Pythagoras. This perspective is healthier than the traditional theological debates, which unfortunately were revived by the influential Baur.

Baur believed many early Christian documents, including the canonical Acts, were biased writings with little historical value, reflecting the changing fortunes of schools and parties rather than actual histories of individuals. He considered the Life of Apollonius to be one such biased work, aimed at promoting philosophy over Christianity. Baur thus removed the subject from its historical context and wrongly accused Philostratus of having a complex agenda.

Baur's view was widely accepted by Zeller in his Philosophie der Griechen and by Reville in Holland. This "Christusbild" theory, which some extremists extended to the point of denying Apollonius's existence, has been popular among writers- especially those who compile encyclopedia articles. It presents a broader issue than the traditional debate over miracles, which was narrowly revived by Newman.

Newman merely uses Apollonius as a pretext for a lengthy discussion on orthodox miracles, dedicating eighteen of the twenty-five pages of his treatise to this topic. Noack also follows Baur and, to some extent, Pettersch, though he takes the topic into the realm of philosophy.

Meanwhile, Mockeberg, the pastor of St. Nicolai in Hamburg, tries to be fair to Apollonius but ends his lively discussion with a burst of orthodox praises for Jesus. While we don't begrudge these praises, they are entirely misplaced in this context.

The transformation of the Jesus-Apollonius miracle debate into a battle of Jesus versus Apollonius, and even Christ versus Anti-Christ, with strong advocates on one side and weak protests on the other, is a distressing sight. How sad it must be for Jesus and Apollonius to see this bitter and pointless conflict over their revered figures.

Why should future generations pit their memories against each other? Did they oppose each other in life? Did their biographers do so after their deaths? Why then couldn't the controversy have ended with Eusebius? Lactantius even admits the point raised by Hierocles—that "miracles" do not prove divinity. Lactantius claims that their arguments rest not on miracles but on the fulfillment of prophecy.

If this more reasonable position had been revived instead of Eusebius's stance, the issue of Apollonius would have been considered in its historical context four hundred years ago, saving much ink and paper. With the advancement of critical methods, however, opinions have slowly become more balanced. It is encouraging to turn to works that have moved the topic out of theological obscurity and into the realm of historical and critical research.

The two volumes by the independent thinker Legrand d'Aussy, which were published at the beginning of the 19th century, are impressively unbiased for their time and represent a commendable effort at historical impartiality. However, during that period, critical analysis was still in its infancy.

Kayser, although not delving deeply into the topic, concludes that Philostratus's account is purely a "fanciful story," a view opposed by I. Muller, who argues there is a significant historical element. The best analysis of the sources, however, comes from Jensen.

Priaulx's study focuses only on the Indian episode and does not critically evaluate the sources.

Among previous studies, the works of Chassang and Baltzer stand out as the most insightful. Both authors recognize the possibilities of psychic science, though they mainly approach it from the limited perspective of spiritistic phenomena.

Tredwell's somewhat grandiose book, written in English and thus accessible to a wider audience, is largely reactionary. It serves as a platform for criticizing Christian origins from a Secularist viewpoint that outright denies the possibility of miracles. The book includes a lot of well-known numismatic and other information that is irrelevant and appears new and surprising to the author. A map at the beginning of the book claims to show the travels of Apollonius but has little connection to Philostratus's text. In fact, Tredwell never demonstrates that he is working with the primary text, using the subject instead as an excuse for a meandering discussion of the first century from his own perspective.This is unfortunate because, aside from Berwick's translation, which is nearly impossible to find, we don't have anything valuable in English for the general reader, except for Sinnett's short sketch, which is more descriptive than critical or explanatory.

So much for the history of opinions about Apollonius; let's now turn to Philostratus' account of Apollonius and try to uncover some traces of the real man, his life, and his work.

Blaise de Vignere's translation was later corrected by Frederic Morel and then by Thomas Artus, Sieur d'Embry, who added bombastic notes criticizing Apollonius' supposed miracles. A French translation was also made by Th. Sibilet around 1560, but it was never published; the manuscript was in the Bibliothèque Impériale (see Miller, *Journal des Savants*, 1849, p. 625, quoted by Chassang).

Kayser published a new edition in 1853 and again a third edition with additional information in the preface in the "Bibliotheca Teubneriana" (Leipzig; 1870).For a general summary of opinions about Apollonius before 1807, see Legrand d'Aussy's work, volume ii, pages 313-327. In 1705, there was a book titled "The History of Apollonius of Tyana Proven to be False and Deceptive" published in Paris. Another work, "An Account of the Life of Apollonius of Tyana," was translated from French and published in London in 1702, based on volume ii of Lenain de Tillemont's "History of the Emperors" (2nd edition, Paris, 1720). Tillemont believed that Apollonius was sent by the Devil to undermine the work of the Savior.

In 1739, "A Critical and Historical Discourse on the Methods of the Principal Authors who wrote for and against Christianity from its Beginning" was published in London, translated from the French of M. l'Abbe Houtteville. This included a "Dissertation on the Life of Apollonius of Tyana" with observations on later Platonists, pages 213-254. In 1793, J. B. Luderwald published "Anti-Hierocles or Jesus Christ and Apollonius of Tyana in Their Great Disparity" in Halle.

Phileleutherus Helvetius wrote a book in 1734 titled "On the Miracles Attributed to Pythagoras, Apollonius of Tyana, Francis of Assisi, Dominic, and Ignatius Loyola" (Draci).

For more texts, refer to Legrand d'Aussy's work, volume ii, page 314. The first two books of Philostratus on the life of Apollonius of Tyana were published in London in 1680. Blount's notes, commonly attributed to Lord Herbert, caused such an uproar that the book was condemned in 1693, and few copies survived. However, Blount's notes were later translated into French during the Enlightenment and included in a French version of the "Life of Apollonius of Tyana" by Philostratus, titled "Life of Apollonius of Tyana by Philostratus with Comments Given in English by Charles Blount on the First Two Books of this Work" (Amsterdam; 1779, 4 volumes, 8vo), with a satirical dedication to Pope Clement XIV, signed "Philalethes."### Modern English Version

1. M. Io. Christianus Herzog's "Practical Philosophy of Apollonius of Tyana" (Leipzig, 1709) is a 20-page academic oration.

2. Philostratus is challenging to translate, but Chassang and Baltzer have done a commendable job. Berwick's version is readable but is often more of a paraphrase and frequently misinterprets the original meaning. Chassang's and Baltzer's translations are the best.

3. This approach would have at least placed Apollonius in his proper historical context and confined the question of Jesus' divinity to its appropriate Judaeo-Christian framework.

4. I cannot offer an opinion on Nielsen's book due to my lack of knowledge of Danish, but it appears to be a careful, scholarly work with many references.

5. Reville's "Pagan Christ" misrepresents the subject, and Newman's treatment makes his work outdated for the twentieth century.

## Section 6: The Biographer of Apollonius

Flavius Philostratus, the author of the only surviving biography of Apollonius, was a prominent writer who lived from around 175 to 245 A.D. He was part of the circle of renowned writers and thinkers that surrounded the philosopher-empress Julia Domna. Julia Domna was a key figure in the Empire during the reigns of her husband, Septimius Severus, and her son, Caracalla. All three members of the imperial family were interested in occult sciences, which were very popular during that era.

Thus, the skeptical Gibbon, in describing Severus and his renowned wife, writes:

"Like many Africans, Severus was deeply interested in magic and divination, skilled in interpreting dreams and omens, and well-versed in the science of astrology, which has influenced human minds throughout history, except in modern times. He lost his first wife while governing Lionnese Gaul. When choosing a second wife, he aimed to connect with someone favored by fortune. Upon learning that a young woman from Emesa in Syria had a royal horoscope, he sought and married her. Julia Domna (as she was called) lived up to all the promises of the stars. Even in her later years, she retained her beauty and combined a vivid imagination with a strong mind and sound judgment, qualities rare in her time. Despite her admirable traits, she never significantly impacted her husband's dark and jealous nature. However, during her son's reign, she managed the Empire's main affairs with prudence, supporting his authority and sometimes moderating his excesses. Julia also devoted herself to literature and philosophy with notable success and great reputation. She was a patron of the arts and a friend to every talented person."

From Gibbon's somewhat reluctant praise, we see that Julia Domna was a woman of exceptional character, whose public actions suggest a deeper purpose, and whose private life remains unwritten. At her request, Philostratus wrote the Life of Apollonius, and she provided him with certain manuscripts. The beautiful daughter of Bassianus, the priest of the sun at Emesa, was an avid collector of books from around the world, especially manuscripts of philosophers, and notes and biographies of famous scholars.

It is uncertain if Philostratus was the best choice for such an important task. While he was an experienced writer, art critic, and passionate antiquarian, he was more of a sophist than a philosopher. Despite his admiration for Pythagoras and his school, it was more from a distance, influenced by curiosity and imagination, rather than personal experience or practical knowledge of its teachings. Therefore, we can expect his account to be more of an outsider's view rather than an insider’s detailed explanation.

Here is Philostratus' account of his sources about Apollonius:

"I gathered my information from the cities that loved him, the temples whose rituals and regulations he restored, what others have said about him, and his own letters. More detailed information came from Damis, an educated man from the ancient city of Ninus. He became a disciple of Apollonius and recorded his travels, in which he participated, along with Apollonius' views, sayings, and predictions. A member of Damis' family brought these previously unknown note-books to Empress Julia."As a member of the princess's circle, who loved and supported all literary works, she asked me to rewrite and improve these sketches. Although the Ninevite was clear, his style was not perfect. I also accessed a book by Maximus of Aegae, which documented all of Apollonius' activities in Aegae. Additionally, there is a will by Apollonius that shows how he almost turned philosophy into a form of worship. Moeragenes' four books on Apollonius are not worth attention, as he knew little about his life.

These are the sources Philostratus used for his information, which are mostly unavailable to us now, except perhaps a few letters. Philostratus put in great effort to gather information, as he mentions in his concluding words that he traveled widely and often encountered the "inspired sayings" of Apollonius. He was particularly familiar with the temple dedicated to Apollonius in Tyana, funded by the emperor, where the priests likely collected as much information as they could about Apollonius.

A thorough analysis of Philostratus's work would need to consider all these factors and try to trace each statement to its original source. However, the historian's job remains incomplete because it is clear that Philostratus has significantly embellished the narrative with his own notes, additions, and composed speeches.Ancient writers did not separate their notes from the main text or mark them clearly, so we must always be cautious to distinguish the original sources from the writer's commentary. Philostratus, in particular, often uses the mention of a name or topic to showcase his own knowledge, which is frequently legendary and fantastical. This is especially true in his description of Apollonius' travels in India. At that time, and for a long time afterward, India was considered the "end of the world," and many strange travelers' tales and mythological stories were told about it. Reading the writings about India from the time of Alexander onward reveals the source of many strange incidents that Philostratus records as Apollonius' experiences.

For example, Apollonius had to cross the Caucasus, a term used for the extensive mountain ranges marking the northern boundaries of Aryavarta. Prometheus was said to be chained to the Caucasus, a story every child knew for centuries. Therefore, if Apollonius crossed the Caucasus, he must have seen those chains. Philostratus assures us that he did (ii. 3) and even adds that you couldn't tell what they were made of! However, reading Megasthenes quickly reduces Philostratus' lengthy account of Apollonius' Indian travels (i. 41--iii. 58) to a much shorter version, as much of it is just filler taken from various Indica sources available to the well-read author. According to such writers, Porus (the Rajah defeated by Alexander) was considered the eternal king of India. In those days, when writing about India or any other little-known country, a writer had to include all the popular legends associated with it to be taken seriously.He needed to add "local color" to his story, especially in a technical rhetorical work like that of Philostratus. It was also common to include set speeches and attribute them to well-known figures during historical events, as seen in Thucydides and the Acts of the Apostles. Philostratus does this often. However, it would take too long to investigate this in detail, even though the writer has notes on the subject. Doing so would turn this sketch into a full book. Therefore, only a few points are highlighted to caution students to distinguish Philostratus's additions from his sources.

While it is important to critically analyze historical facts, we should also avoid judging everything by modern standards. The only ancient religious literature that has been treated with real sympathy in the West is the Judeo-Christian tradition. People have been trained to feel at home with it, and anything from antiquity that presents religion differently is often seen as strange or even repulsive if it is unclear or unusual. The words and actions of Jewish prophets, Jesus, and the Apostles are told with reverence and adorned with beautiful language and the best thoughts of the time. In contrast, the words and actions of other prophets and teachers have often been met with unsympathetic criticism, with little effort to understand their perspective. If more balanced justice had been applied, the world today would be richer in sympathy, open-mindedness, understanding of nature, humanity, and God, and overall, in spiritual experience.In reading about the Life of Apollonius, we should remember to view it from a Greek perspective, not from a Jewish or Protestant one. The many gods in their respective roles should be seen as just as legitimate a manifestation of the Divine as the singular God or the entire cosmos, because "Gods" exist regardless of religious commandments and beliefs. Saints, Martyrs, and Angels may have replaced Heroes, Daemons, and Gods in name and viewpoint, but these changes in human perception do not alter the underlying truths.

Understanding the universal aspects of religion through the various names people give them, and empathizing with the hopes and fears of different religious perspectives—essentially reflecting on the past lives of our own souls—is a challenging task. However, until we can truly place ourselves in others' shoes, we can only grasp one side of God's infinite existence. A student of comparative religion must not be intimidated by different terms; they should not recoil at "polytheism," be horrified by "dualism," or feel extra satisfaction with "monotheism." They should not feel awe when saying "Yahweh" and contempt when saying "Zeus." They should not picture a satyr when hearing "daemon" or imagine a beautiful winged being when hearing "angel." For such a student, heresy and orthodoxy should not matter; they should see only their own soul gradually gaining experience, viewing life from every angle, in hopes of eventually seeing the whole picture and, by doing so, becoming one with God.

To Apollonius, the specific form of a person's faith was unimportant; he felt at home in all lands and among all religions. He had a helpful word for everyone and a deep understanding of each belief system, which allowed him to heal others.Such men are rare; the records of such men are valuable and need no embellishment from rhetoricians. Let us first attempt to outline the early external life and travels of Apollonius without the embellishments of Philostratus. Then, we will examine the nature of his mission, the philosophy he cherished and considered his religion, and finally, if possible, his inner life.

- A collection of these letters (but not all of them) was once owned by Emperor Hadrian (AD 117-138) and left in his palace at Antium. This indicates the significant fame Apollonius had shortly after his disappearance from history and while he was still remembered. Hadrian was an enlightened ruler, a great traveler, a lover of religion, and an initiate of the Eleusinian Mysteries.
- Nineveh.
- Writing tablets. This suggests that the account of Damis was likely not very extensive, although Philostratus later claims it was detailed (i. 19).
- One of the imperial secretaries of the time, known for his eloquence, and tutor to Apollonius.
- A town not far from Tarsus.
- The term "ypotheioazun" appears only in this passage, and its exact meaning is uncertain.This text by Moeragenes is casually mentioned by Origen in his work "Contra Celsum" (vi. 41, edited by Lommatzsch, Berlin, 1841, vol. ii, p. 373). The term "logois daimoniois" is used.

We rarely have such clear indications as in section i. 25: "The following is what I have been able to learn about Babylon." For more information, see E. A. Schwanbeck's "Megasthenis Indica" (Bonn, 1846) and J. W. M'Crindle's works: "Ancient India as described by Megasthenes and Arrian" (Calcutta, Bombay, London, 1877), "The Commerce and Navigation of the Erythraean Sea" (1879), "Ancient India as described by Ktesias" (1882), "Ancient India as described by Ptolemy" (London, 1885), and "The Invasion of India by Alexander the Great" (London, 1893, 1896).

Another good example of this is in Philostratus's discussion on elephants, which he takes from Juba's "History of Libya" (ii. 13 and 16). This could be a title or refer to the king of the Purus.

Philostratus does not hide his embellishments. For instance, in ii. 17, he says: "Let me, however, defer what I have to say on the subject of serpents, of the manner of hunting which Damis gives a description." (From "Apollonius of Tyana" by G.R.S. Mead, 1901, at sacred-texts.com)

## Section 7: Early Life

Apollonius was born in Tyana, a city in southern Cappadocia, sometime in the early years of the Christian era. His parents were from an ancient and wealthy family (i. 4). At a young age, he showed signs of an excellent memory and a strong inclination towards study, and he was also noted for his beauty. At the age of fourteen, he was sent to Tarsus, a renowned center of learning at the time, to complete his education. However, the focus on rhetoric and style, and the life of the "schools," did not suit his serious nature. He soon left for Aegae, a coastal town east of Tarsus, where he found a more suitable environment and eagerly dove into the study of philosophy.He became close with the priests at the temple of Aesculapius, where cures were still performed, and enjoyed the company and teachings of students and teachers from the Platonic, Stoic, Peripatetic, and Epicurean schools of philosophy. Although he carefully studied all these philosophies, he was particularly drawn to the teachings of the Pythagorean school, despite his teacher, Euxenus, merely repeating the doctrines without practicing them. Apollonius's keen memory brought life to his teacher's dull recitations and inspired him to fully embrace the Pythagorean lifestyle at the age of sixteen. He retained his affection for Euxenus and rewarded him generously. When Euxenus asked how he would begin his new way of life, Apollonius replied, "Like doctors cleanse their patients." Therefore, he refused to consume anything with animal life, believing it clouded the mind and made it impure. He only ate fruits and vegetables, considering them the purest form of food. He also avoided wine, as it "clouded the soul" and "disturbed the mind's composure." Additionally, he went barefoot, let his hair grow long, and wore only linen. He lived in the temple, impressing the priests and gaining the approval of Aesculapius. His ascetic and pious lifestyle quickly made him famous, and a saying about him among the Cilicians became a proverb. When he was twenty, his father died (his mother had passed away years earlier), leaving a significant fortune that Apollonius was to share with his older brother, a reckless and dissolute twenty-three-year-old.While still a minor, Apollonius lived in Aegae, where the Temple of Aesculapius had become a bustling center of philosophical study. When he came of age, he returned to Tyana to help his brother, who had led a destructive lifestyle and spent his share of their inheritance. Apollonius gave him half of his own share and, through gentle advice, helped him become a better person. He also organized his family's affairs, distributing the rest of his inheritance among relatives and keeping only a small amount for himself, as he needed little and planned never to marry.

Apollonius then took a vow of silence for five years, determined not to write on philosophy until he had undergone this discipline. He spent these years mostly in Pamphylia and Cilicia, studying and traveling from city to city rather than isolating himself in a community or monastery. Despite the enormous temptations to break his vow of silence, including ridicule from the public, he maintained his dignity and self-control. Often, he was on the verge of reacting to insults or false rumors but reminded himself to stay patient and silent.

Despite not speaking, Apollonius still managed to do good and began correcting societal abuses even at a young age.Using his eyes, hands, and head movements, he communicated effectively. Once, in Aspendus, Pamphylia, he stopped a serious corn riot by calming the crowd with his powerful gestures and then writing his message on tablets. Up to this point, Philostratus seems to have relied on Maximus of Aegae's account, at least until Apollonius left Aegae. There is a significant gap in the story, with only two brief, vague chapters covering about fifteen to twenty years until Damis' notes begin. After a five-year silence, we find Apollonius in Antioch, but this appears to be just one stop in a long series of travels and work. Philostratus likely emphasizes Antioch because he gathered most of his information about this period of Apollonius’ life from this busy city.

Later, we learn from Philostratus (i. 20; iv. 38) that Apollonius spent time with the Arabians, learning from them. By Arabia, we mean the region south of Palestine, known for its many mystical communities at that time. Apollonius visited remote places where holiness persisted, not the crowded cities, because his discussions needed "men and not people." He traveled from one temple, shrine, and community to another, suggesting some form of common initiation that welcomed him. No matter where he went, he maintained a consistent daily routine.At sunrise, he practiced certain religious exercises alone, sharing their nature only with those who had completed a four or five-year period of silence. He then talked with the temple priests or community leaders, depending on whether he was in a Greek or non-Greek temple with public rituals, or in a community with its unique discipline separate from the public cult.

He aimed to restore the public cults to their original purity and to improve the practices of private brotherhoods. His most significant work was with those pursuing an inner spiritual life, who already saw Apollonius as a teacher of the hidden way. To these comrades and students, he dedicated much attention, always ready to answer questions and provide guidance and instruction. However, he did not neglect the general public; he always taught them, but only after midday. He believed that those living the inner life should enter the presence of the Gods at dawn, spend the morning learning and teaching holy things, and only in the afternoon attend to human affairs. Thus, Apollonius devoted his mornings to divine science and his afternoons to ethical and practical instruction.
After his daily work, he bathed in cold water, a common practice among mystics of the time, such as the Essenes and Therapeuts. Philostratus vaguely mentions that after these activities, Apollonius decided to visit the Brachmanes and Sarmanes. The reason for this long and dangerous journey is not clear from Philostratus’s account, who only mentions that Apollonius thought it beneficial for a young man to travel.It is clear that Apollonius never traveled just for the sake of traveling. He always had a specific purpose. On this occasion, he assured his disciples, who tried to dissuade him and refused to accompany him, that his guides were wisdom and his inner mentor (daemon). "Since you are faint-hearted," said the lone traveler, "I bid you farewell. I must go wherever wisdom and my inner self lead me. The Gods are my advisers, and I can only rely on their counsel."

- Legends about his miraculous birth circulated, similar to other birth legends of great people.
- The phrase "arretui tini sofia xynelabe" implies that wisdom accompanied him.
- "Sci." refers to his tutor, which means his "memory" or "daemon."
- The "aether" presumably refers to the mind.
- He was likely encouraged by unseen helpers at the temple who facilitated cures through dreams and psychic or mesmerizing means.
- Some think Apollonius was still a young man when he began his travels to India, rather than being forty-six, as others believe. The chronology is difficult to determine.
- The phrase "fesas oyk anthrupun eaytui dein, all' andrun" means he considered himself not just a man, but a greater entity.
- "Idiotropa" refers to his unique way of thinking.
- "Tous oytu filosofountas" means those who philosophize in a certain way.
- This suggests he spent time in silent meditation.
- The term "Sarman" is a Greek corruption of the Sanskrit "Shramana" and Pali "Samana," technical terms for a Buddhist ascetic or monk. Copyists' errors transformed it into "Germanes" and then "Hyrcanians."
- This indicates Apollonius was still young, not between forty and fifty as some have claimed.Tredwell (p. 77) dates the Indian travels as 41-54 A.D.

## Section 8: The Travels of Apollonius

Apollonius leaves Antioch and travels to Ninus, the remnants of the once great city of Nineveh. There, he meets Damis, who becomes his loyal companion and devoted follower. Damis says, "Let us go together. You will follow God, and I will follow you!" (i. 19). From this point, Philostratus claims to rely heavily on Damis's narrative. Before continuing, it's important to assess Damis's character and determine how much Apollonius trusted him. Damis was an ardent admirer who saw Apollonius almost as a divine being with incredible powers that he couldn't fully understand. Like Ananda, Buddha's favorite disciple, Damis made slow progress in understanding spiritual science. He remained on the outskirts of the temples and communities that Apollonius had full access to, often stating his ignorance of his master's plans.

Damis referred to his notes as the "crumbs" from the "feasts of the Gods" (i. 19), implying that he could only grasp fragments of what Apollonius shared with him. This suggests that Damis misunderstood much of what he heard and added his own interpretations. It is clear that Damis was not fully initiated, which explains his awe-struck perspective and general superficiality.Another clear fact from the story is his timid nature. He is constantly afraid for himself or his master. Even towards the end, when Apollonius is imprisoned by Domitian, he only believes Apollonius is a willing prisoner after seeing the extraordinary removal of the chains before his eyes. Damis admires and marvels at Apollonius; he focuses on trivial details and exaggerates them, while he can only guess at the truly important events based on a few hints from Apollonius. As the story progresses, it becomes more serious, but whatever Damis leaves out, Philostratus is quick to add from his own collection of wonders if given the chance. Even if we critically removed all the embellishments from this tale, there would still be a core of truth that represents Apollonius and gives us an idea of his significance. Apollonius was one of the greatest travelers of ancient times. According to Philostratus, the main places he visited are as follows:

From Ninus, Apollonius travels to Babylon, where he stays for one year and eight months and visits nearby cities like Ecbatana, the capital of Media. From Babylon to the Indian frontier, no specific names are mentioned. He probably entered India through the Khaibar Pass, with the first city mentioned being Taxila (Attock). They cross the tributaries of the Indus to the Ganges valley and finally reach the "monastery of the wise men," where Apollonius spends four months. This monastery is in Nepal, in the mountains, and the nearest "city" is called Paraca.Philostratus created a lot of confusion with Damis' account, and Damis himself had already made significant changes to Indian names. For example, "Paraca" might be Damis' attempt to refer to "Bharata," the general name for the Ganges valley where the dominant Aryas lived. It's also likely that the wise men mentioned were Buddhists, as they lived in a "tursis," which Damis thought looked like a fort.

Philostratus probably couldn't understand the geography of India from Damis' diary because the names were unfamiliar to him. Once he used up the few Greek names he knew from Alexander's expedition, he got lost until he found the travelers again at the mouth of the Indus River. Philostratus (and maybe Damis) was so focused on Apollonius' goal of finding a specific community that he described it as the only one of its kind in India. Apollonius went to India with a purpose and returned with a mission. His constant questions about the "wise men" he was seeking might have led Damis to think they were the only "Gymnosophists," or naked philosophers, a term Greek legends incorrectly applied to all Hindu ascetics based on the peculiar practices of a few.

Returning to our journey, Philostratus added details to the voyage from the Indus to the mouth of the Euphrates.Using the information he gathered from the Indica, which was accessible to him, we return to Babylon and familiar places with the following route:

Babylon, Nineveh, Antioch, Seleucia, Cyprus; then to Ionia, where he spends some time in Asia Minor, especially at Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamon, and Troy. Apollonius then crosses to Lesbos and later sails to Athens, where he spends several years in Greece visiting the temples of Hellas, reforming their rites, and instructing the priests. He then travels to Crete and subsequently to Rome during Nero's reign. In A.D. 66, Nero issued a decree forbidding philosophers from staying in Rome, so Apollonius set out for Spain and landed at Gades, now known as Cadiz. He appears to have stayed in Spain briefly, then crossed to Africa and traveled by sea to Sicily, visiting the principal cities and temples there.

From Sicily, Apollonius returned to Greece, four years after he had landed in Athens from Lesbos. From Piraeus, he sailed to Chios, then to Rhodes, and finally to Alexandria. In Alexandria, he spent some time and had several meetings with the future Emperor Vespasian. He then embarked on a long journey up the Nile to Ethiopia beyond the cataracts, where he visited a community of ascetics known as Gymnosophists. On his return to Alexandria, he was summoned by Titus, who had just become emperor, to meet him at Tarsus. After this meeting, he seems to have returned to Egypt. Philostratus mentions vaguely that he spent some time in Lower Egypt and visited the Phoenicians, Cilicians, Ionians, Achaeans, and also traveled to Italy.Vespasian was emperor from 69 to 79, and Titus from 79 to 81. Apollonius met with Vespasian just before he became emperor, suggesting that Apollonius spent several years on his journey to Ethiopia. This implies that Damis' account is incomplete. In 81, Domitian became emperor, and like he opposed Nero's foolishness, Apollonius also criticized Domitian's actions. This made him suspicious to the emperor, but instead of avoiding Rome, he decided to confront Domitian directly. Traveling from Egypt to Greece, then from Corinth to Sicily, and finally to Rome via Puteoli, Apollonius was tried and acquitted in Rome. He then returned to Greece, where he stayed for two years. After Domitian's death in 96, Apollonius visited Smyrna, Ephesus, and other favorite places. He sent Damis to Rome and then disappeared, possibly embarking on another journey to his beloved "home of the wise men."

Domitian was killed in 96 A.D., and one of Apollonius' last known actions was having a vision of this event as it happened. Thus, Apollonius' trial in Rome occurred around 93, leaving a twelve-year gap from his meeting with Titus in 81. Philostratus can only fill this gap with vague stories. Regarding Apollonius' age at his mysterious disappearance, Philostratus notes that Damis says nothing, but some claim he was eighty, ninety, or even a hundred years old.The estimate of eighty years seems to align best with the other chronological indications, but there is no certainty given the current materials available. This is the general outline of the life of Apollonius. Even a casual reader of Philostratus's account of his travels would be impressed by Apollonius's relentless energy and endurance. Now, let's focus on a few interesting points related to the temples and communities he visited.

^76:* Here, they saw the giant mountains, the Imaus (Himavat) or Himalayan Range, where the great mountain Meros (Meru) is located. The Greek translation of the Hindu Olympus to Meros led to the myth that Bacchus was born from the thigh (meros) of Zeus—one of the reasons Professor Max Muller called mythology a "disease of language"

^77:* Referring to his teachers, he says, "I always remember my masters and travel the world teaching what I learned from them" (vi. 18).

^78:* According to some, Apollonius would be about sixty-eight years old. However, if he was around thirty when he left for India, he either spent a very long time there, or we have an incomplete record of his activities in Asia Minor, Greece, Italy, and Spain after his return.

## Section 9: In the Temples and Retreats of Religion

Considering that Apollonius' interactions with the temple priests and mystics were highly private and secretive, it's no surprise that the Damis-Philostratus narrative only provides superficial details. Despite this, these glimpses are still interesting.

The temple of Aesculapius at Aegae, where Apollonius spent his formative years, was one of many healing centers in Greece, operating very differently from modern hospitals. The atmosphere was rich with psychic influences, and for centuries, patients had come to "consult the God."

To receive help, they had to go through certain purifications and follow rules set by the priests. They would then spend the night in the shrine, where they would receive healing instructions in their dreams. This approach was likely used only when the priests' skills were insufficient. The priests were probably very skilled in interpreting these dreams and understanding their meanings.

Apollonius, who enjoyed spending time in the temple, must have found spiritual fulfillment and learned inner wisdom there. However, his natural abilities soon surpassed his teachers, making him the "favourite of the God."In our own time, there are many documented cases of patients in trances or other psychic states diagnosing and treating themselves. This helps us understand the numerous healing possibilities that the Greeks embodied in the figure of Aesculapius.

Later, a leading Indian sage discusses Aesculapius and the art of healing, stating that all medicine relies on psychic diagnosis and foresight. It is also worth noting that patients would always record their recovery on a tablet in the temple, much like what is done today in Roman Catholic countries.

On his way to India, Apollonius spent a lot of time with the Magi in Babylon. He visited them at noon and midnight, but Damis, his companion, was not allowed to join him. When asked about these visits, Apollonius would only say, "They are wise, but not in all things."

There is a description of a hall that Apollonius had access to, which appears to be a distorted version of a temple interior. The roof was dome-shaped and covered with "sapphire," depicting a blue sky with golden models of heavenly bodies, appearing to move in the ether. Hanging from the roof were four golden "Iygges," which the Magi called the "Tongues of the Gods." These were winged wheels or spheres associated with Fate. Their prototypes are imperfectly described in the Vision of Ezekiel, and the Hecatine strophali or spherulae used in magical practices may be their degenerate descendants.

This subject is extremely interesting, but it is challenging to study in our current age of skepticism and lack of understanding of the past. The "Gods" who taught early humanity, according to occult tradition, came from a more advanced humanity than the one currently evolving on Earth. They provided guidance and, once humans were capable of independence, they withdrew. However, the memory of their actions and a distorted version of the mysteries they introduced have persisted in myths and legends. Seers have occasionally glimpsed what they taught and how they taught it, and the tradition of the Mysteries has preserved some of this knowledge through symbols and tools. The Iygges of the Magi are said to be remnants of this memory.

Regarding the Indian sages, it is difficult to piece together a coherent story from the chaotic mix in the Damis-Philostratus romance. Damis seems to have mixed various memories and gossip without distinguishing between different communities or sects, resulting in a confusing portrayal that Philostratus presents as a description of the "hill" and its "sages."

Damis' confused memories, however, have little to do with the actual monastery and its ascetic inhabitants, whom Apollonius sought. What Apollonius heard and saw there, he kept to himself, except for the following enigmatic statement: "I saw men dwelling on the earth and yet not on it, defended on all sides, yet without any defense, and yet possessed of nothing but what all possess." This statement appears in two passages (iii. 15 and vi. 11), with Philostratus noting that Apollonius spoke and wrote them enigmatically.

The meaning of this saying is clear: these men were on Earth but not worldly, as their minds were focused on higher things.They were protected by their innate spiritual power, as often shown in Indian literature, and yet they had nothing that all men couldn't have if they developed their spiritual side. But this explanation is too simple for Philostratus, so he adds tales from Damis, or rather travelers' stories, about levitation, magical illusions, and the like.

The leader of the community is called Iarchas, an entirely un-Indian name. The Greeks were notorious for mispronouncing foreign names, and here we also have to consider the mistakes of many ignorant scribes, along with Philostratus and Damis. I suggest that the name might be a corruption of Arhat.

Damis' story mainly focuses on the psychic and spiritual knowledge of the sages. They know what happens far away, can tell the past and future, and read people's past lives. The messenger sent to meet Apollonius carried what Damis called a golden anchor, and if this is true, it might be an early version of the Tibetan dorje, now a symbol of the "rod of power," similar to Zeus's thunderbolt. This suggests a Buddhist community, though other clues point equally to Brahmanical customs, like the caste-mark on the messenger's forehead, carrying bamboo staves, growing their hair long, and wearing turbans.

However, the whole account is too confusing to extract any historical details. We can get an idea of Apollonius' visit from this mysterious letter he sent to his hosts:

^"I came to you by land and you have given me the sea; rather, by sharing your wisdom with me, you have given me the power to travel through heaven. I will remind the Greeks of these things and speak to you as if you were here, assuming I have not learned in vain."

It is clear from these cryptic sentences that the "sea" and the "cup of Tantalus" symbolize the "wisdom" given to Apollonius—wisdom he was to bring back to the Greeks. He indicates that he returned from India with a clear mission and the means to achieve it. Not only had he absorbed the wisdom of the Brahma-vidya, but he also learned how to communicate with them while being in Greece, even though they were in India.

However, this clear meaning— clear at least to students of the occult— was beyond the understanding of Damis or Philostratus. The mention of the "cup of Tantalus" in this letter likely inspired the endless loving cup episode in iii. 32 and its link to the mythical fountains of Bacchus. Damis used it to "explain" Apollonius' statement about the sages: they were "possessed of nothing but what all possess." This later changed form to, "possessing nothing, they have the possessions of all men" (iii. 15).

Upon returning to Greece, one of the first shrines Apollonius visited was that of Aphrodite at Paphos in Cyprus (iii. 58). The most notable feature of the Paphian worship of Venus was the representation of the goddess by a mysterious stone symbol. It was about the size of a human being, but shaped like a pine cone, though smooth on the surface.

Paphos was apparently the oldest shrine dedicated to Venus in Greece. The mysteries were very old but not native; they were brought from the mainland, later known as Cilicia, in ancient times. The worship of the Goddess involved prayers and the "pure flame of fire," and the temple was a major center for divination.

Apollonius spent some time here and taught the priests about their sacred rituals. In Asia Minor, he particularly liked the temple of Aesculapius at Pergamus. He healed many patients there and instructed on the proper methods to get reliable results through prescribed dreams. At Troy, Apollonius spent a night alone at Achilles' tomb, which was once a very sacred place in Greece. The reason for this is unclear, as the conversation with Achilles' spirit reported by Philostratus seems unlikely. However, Apollonius later visited Thessaly to urge the people to renew the old rites to the hero, suggesting it was part of his effort to restore and purify Greek traditions, allowing the nation to thrive again.

Rumors also claimed that Achilles told Apollonius where to find the statue of the hero Palamedes on the Aeolian coast. Apollonius restored the statue, and Philostratus claimed to have seen it himself. This might seem trivial, but Palamedes is important elsewhere in Philostratus' story. Understanding this is difficult with Damis and Philostratus interpreting Apollonius' actions.

Palamedes was one of the heroes before Troy and was said to have invented letters or completed the alphabet of Cadmus. From two vague references, we learn that our philosopher considered Palamedes a philosopher-hero of the Trojan era, even though Homer barely mentioned him. Was this why Apollonius was eager to restore his statue? Not entirely; there seemed to be a more direct reason. Damis claimed that Apollonius had met Palamedes in India, at a monastery, where Iarchas once pointed out a young ascetic who could "write without ever learning letters." This youth, Damis believed, was Palamedes in a previous life.

Skeptics might say, "Of course! Just as Pythagoras was thought to be a reincarnation of the Trojan hero Euphorbus, the young Indian must be the reincarnation of Palamedes! One legend simply led to another." By this logic, one would expect Apollonius himself, not an unknown Hindu ascetic, to have been Palamedes in a past life. Nonetheless, Apollonius restored the rites to Achilles and erected a chapel where he placed the neglected statue of Palamedes.

It seems the heroes of the Trojan period still had some connection to Greece, according to the mystical knowledge Apollonius had. If Protestant skeptics can't understand it, perhaps Roman Catholic readers might reconsider by thinking of "hero" as "saint."Could it be that Apollonius's interest in the graves and monuments of Greece's great dead was influenced by the same ideas that led to the creation of countless dagobas and stupas in Buddhist lands, originally for the Buddha’s relics and later for the relics of arhats and great teachers? In Lesbos, Apollonius visited the ancient temple of the Orphic mysteries, a major center for prophecy and divination in earlier times. He had the privilege of entering the inner shrine there.

When Apollonius arrived in Athens during the Eleusinian Mysteries, the people and even the candidates for initiation neglected their religious duties to meet him. Apollonius rebuked them and participated in the preliminary rites, presenting himself for initiation. It might surprise readers that Apollonius, who had already experienced higher initiations, sought initiation at Eleusis. However, the Eleusinian Mysteries served as an intermediate stage between popular worship and genuine inner circles of instruction. They preserved traditions of deeper knowledge, even if their current leaders had forgotten these teachings. To restore these rites to their original purity or purpose, Apollonius had to engage with the institution directly; he could not achieve change from the outside. He aimed to support the ancient institution by publicly seeking initiation, not for personal gain.Whether it was due to the hierophant's ignorance or jealousy of Apollonius' influence, he refused to admit the philosopher, accusing him of being a sorcerer and claiming that no one in contact with evil entities could be initiated. Apollonius responded with irony, suggesting the hierophant missed a more serious accusation: that he, Apollonius, knew more about the rites than the hierophant and was pretending to seek initiation from those more knowledgeable. This was actually true; Apollonius had feigned ignorance. The hierophant, alarmed by the people's reaction and the undeniable knowledge of Apollonius, asked him to accept the initiation. Apollonius declined, saying he would be initiated later by the next hierophant, which happened four years later.

While in Athens, Apollonius spoke out against the effeminacy of the Bacchanalia and the brutality of gladiatorial combats. He visited several ancient temples in Greece, such as Dodona, Delphi, the shrine of Apollo at Abae in Phocis, the caves of Amphiaraus and Trophonius, and the temple of the Muses on Helicon. When he entered the inner sanctums of these temples to restore the rites, he was accompanied only by the priests and some of his closest disciples.This suggests a broader meaning for the words "restoring" or "reforming." When we read about the many places consecrated by Apollonius, we think that part of his work involved reconsecrating and psychically purifying these ancient sites. However, his main work was teaching. As Philostratus puts it, "bowls of his words were set up everywhere for the thirsty to drink from" (iv. 24). Apollonius not only restored ancient religious rites but also focused on ancient political systems and institutions. For example, he successfully urged the Spartans to return to their traditional lifestyle, which included athletic exercises, frugal living, and strict discipline (iv. 27, 31-34). He praised the Olympic Games for maintaining high standards (iv. 29), reminded the ancient Amphictionic Council of its duties (iv. 23), and corrected the abuses of the Panionian assembly (iv. 5).

In the spring of 66 A.D., he left Greece for Crete, where he spent much of his time at the sanctuaries of Mount Ida and the temple of Aesculapius at Lebene. Despite all of Crete visiting Lebene, he refused to visit the famous Labyrinth at Knossos, likely because it had been a center of human sacrifice and was associated with dark ancient cults.

In Rome, Apollonius continued his work of reforming the temples with the full support of the Pontifex Maximus Telesinus, one of the consuls for the year 66 A.D., who was also a philosopher and a dedicated student of religion (iv. 40).But his stay in the imperial city was quickly cut short because in October, Nero intensified his persecution of philosophers by issuing a decree that banished them from Rome. Both Telesinus and Apollonius had to leave Italy. We next find Apollonius in Spain, based in the temple of Hercules at Cadiz. On his way back to Greece, he traveled through Africa and Sicily, spending some time there and visiting Mount Etna. He spent the winter of 67 A.D. in Eleusis, living in the temple, and in the spring of the following year, he sailed to Alexandria, stopping in Rhodes along the way. Alexandria, known for its philosophy and eclecticism, welcomed him warmly as an old friend.

However, reforming the public cults of Egypt proved to be a much more difficult task than any he had previously attempted. His presence in the temple, likely the temple of Serapis, commanded universal respect. Everything about him and every word he spoke seemed to convey wisdom and a touch of the divine. The high priest of the temple looked on with proud disdain and mockingly asked, "Who is wise enough to reform the religion of the Egyptians?" Apollonius confidently replied, "Any sage who comes from the Indians."

In Egypt, as elsewhere, Apollonius opposed blood sacrifices and tried to replace them with offerings of frankincense shaped like the intended victim. He attempted to reform many abuses in the behavior of the Alexandrians, but he was particularly harsh on their wild enthusiasm for horse-racing, which often led to violence.Apollonius appears to have spent most of the last twenty years of his life in Egypt. However, Philostratus provides no details about his activities in the secret shrines of this mysterious land. We do know that during a long journey to Ethiopia up the Nile, he visited every city, temple, and community, exchanging advice and sacred teachings everywhere (v. 43).

### Section 9 Footnotes

For the latest study on Aesculapius, see "The Cult of Asclepios" by Alice Walton, Ph.D., in The Cornell Studies in Classical Philology (Ithaca, N.Y.; 1891).

Philostratus found notes on Apollonius's Indian travels long after they were written. This suggests Philostratus discovered them in some work or letter by Apollonius, making this account independent of Damis'.

Tantalus is said to have stolen the cup of nectar from the gods, which the Indians call amrita, the ocean of immortality and wisdom. The phrase "oyden kektemenoys e?` ta pantun," quoted twice by Philostratus, can't be changed to "meden kektemenoys ta pantun exein" without distorting its meaning. For further information, see Tacitus, Historia, ii. 3.

Apollonius also built a precinct around the tomb of Leonidas at Thermopylae (iv. 23), a major center for dream-based divination (see ii. 37).

## Section 10: The Gymnosophists of Upper Egypt

Now, we turn to Apollonius’s visit to the "Gymnosophists" in "Ethiopia," which, although highlighted by Philostratus as the artistic and literary climax of his Egyptian journey, is just one event in the otherwise undocumented life of this enigmatic philosopher in ancient Egypt.If Philostratus had dedicated a chapter or two to the practices, discipline, and doctrines of the numerous ascetic and mystic communities in Egypt and nearby regions during that time, he would have greatly benefited students of early history. However, he doesn't mention any of this and still expects us to believe that Damis' recollections are a precise record of actual events. It's clear that Damis was more of a travel companion than an initiated student. So, who were these mysterious "Gymnosophists," as they are often called, and where does their name come from? Damis refers to them simply as the "Naked" (gymnoi), and it’s clear that this term isn't meant to be taken literally. For both the Indian ascetics and those in upper Egypt, the term "naked" is not appropriate in a purely physical sense, as shown by the descriptions from Damis and Philostratus. A remark from one of these ascetics provides a clue to the real meaning of the term. "At the age of fourteen," he tells Apollonius, "I gave up my inheritance to those who wanted it, and naked I sought the Naked."

This language is similar to how Philo describes the Therapeut communities, which he says were widespread in every province of Egypt and beyond. However, we shouldn't assume that all these communities were identical. Philo tries to argue that the most devout and important of these groups was his own community on the southern shore of Lake Moeris, which had a strong Semitic, if not strictly Jewish, influence. For Philo, any community with a Jewish atmosphere would naturally seem the best.The unique and main interest of our community, located at the far end of the land above the cataracts, was its distant connection with India. The community is called a frontisterion, meaning a place for meditation, a term used by ecclesiastical writers for a monastery. It is best known to classical students from Aristophanes' humorous use in The Clouds, where he refers to Socrates' school as a phrontisterion or "thinking shop." The collection of monasteries (iera), likely caves, shrines, or cells, was situated on a hill near the Nile. They were all separated from each other, scattered across the hill, and cleverly arranged. The area had almost no trees, except for a single group of palms under which they held their general meetings (vi. 6).

It's hard to get exact details about the lifestyle of these ascetics from the speeches made by the head of the community and Apollonius (vi. 10-13, 18-22). However, it’s clear that they led lives of great toil and physical hardship, which they believed was the only way to gain wisdom. We don't know much about their religious practices, except that at midday, the Naked would retire to their monasteries (vi. 14). Apollonius' arguments mainly remind the community of its Eastern origins and its past connection with India, which it seemed to have forgotten. These communities in southern Egypt and northern Ethiopia presumably dated back several centuries, and some may have had distant Buddhist influences. One younger member of our community, who left to follow Apollonius, said he joined after hearing his father’s enthusiastic account of the wisdom of the Indians. His father had been a ship captain trading to the East.His father told him that these "Ethiopians" were from India, so he joined them instead of making the long and dangerous journey to the Indus River (vi. 16). If this story is true, it suggests that the founders of this lifestyle were Indian ascetics, likely Buddhists. After the initial influence, these communities, probably made up of Egyptians, Arabs, and Ethiopians, were left on their own. Over time, they forgot their origins and original rules. Such speculation is allowed because of the repeated claims of a connection between these Gymnosophists and India. The main point of the story is that they were Indians who had forgotten their roots and lost their wisdom.

The last event Philostratus records about Apollonius in relation to shrines and temples is his visit to the famous and ancient oracle of Trophonius, near Lebadea in Boeotia. Apollonius reportedly spent seven days alone in this mysterious "cave" and returned with a book full of questions and answers about "philosophy" (viii. 19). In Philostratus's time, this book was still in Hadrian's palace at Antium, along with many letters from Apollonius. Many people visited Antium specifically to see it (viii. 19, 20). Amid the legendary tales Philostratus shares about the cave of Trophonius, a small truth might be found. The "cave" appears to have been an ancient temple or shrine, cut into a hill, with numerous long underground passages.In ancient times, this place was likely one of the most sacred centers of early Greek religion, possibly even a relic from a Greece that existed thousands of years before Christ. According to Plato, Solon learned about this ancient Greece from the priests of Sais. It might have also been an underground shrine similar to the famous Dictaean cave in Crete, which was rediscovered last year by the diligent efforts of Evans and Hogarth.

Philostratus, who describes the travels of Apollonius, is not very helpful when it comes to detailing the temples and communities Apollonius visited. However, this might not be Philostratus' fault, as Apollonius' most significant work was deeply personal and involved secretive groups, making it inaccessible to outsiders. Those initiated into these secrets would not divulge them. Therefore, we only have clear historical records of Apollonius when he performed public acts. Otherwise, he would enter a temple or community and disappear from public view.

It might surprise us that Apollonius could travel so extensively after giving up his personal fortune. However, it seems he was sometimes provided with funds from temple treasuries and was often given free accommodation by the temples or communities where he stayed. Finally, Apollonius did a great service by driving away some Chaldean and Egyptian frauds who were exploiting the fears of cities along the left shores of the Hellespont.These cities had suffered greatly from earthquakes, and in their panic, they gave large sums of money to these adventurers, who "profited from others' misfortunes," to perform propitiatory rites. Taking money for teaching sacred science or performing sacred rites was considered the most detestable of crimes by true philosophers.

The word "gymnos" (naked) usually means lightly clad, such as when a man is said to plow "naked," meaning with only one garment. This is evident from comparisons made between the clothing of the Gymnosophists and the attire of people in hot weather in Athens. They had neither huts nor houses but lived in the open air.

## Section 11: Appolonius and the Rulers of the Empire

Apollonius not only revived and restored old religious centers for reasons unknown, and supported the religious life of the time in various ways, but he also indirectly influenced the Empire's destinies through its supreme rulers. This influence was always moral, not political. It was exerted through philosophical discussions and teachings, either in person or by letter. During his travels, Apollonius conversed about philosophy and discussed the life and duties of a wise ruler with kings, rulers, and magistrates. He aimed to advise those emperors who would listen to him.

Before becoming emperors, Vespasian, Titus, and Nerva were friends and admirers of Apollonius, while Nero and Domitian viewed the philosopher with fear.During Apollonius' brief stay in Rome in 66 A.D., he was careful not to say anything that could be interpreted as treasonous by the many informers. Despite this, he was brought before Tigellinus, Nero's notorious favorite, and subjected to intense questioning. Until then, Apollonius had focused on reforming religion and restoring ancient traditions. However, Nero's oppressive rule, which targeted even the most innocent philosophers, made him realize the immediate threat of losing freedom of thought under unchecked tyranny. From that point on, he took a keen interest in the emperors who followed.

Damis, although unaware of Apollonius' specific reasons for traveling to Spain after being expelled from Rome, believed it was to support an upcoming revolt against Nero. He inferred this from a secret three-day meeting Apollonius had with the Governor of Baetica in Cadiz, who ended their conversation with the words, "Farewell, and remember Vindex." Soon after, Vindex, the Governor of Gaul, started his revolt. Despite this timing, Apollonius’ life and character were not aligned with political scheming. Instead, he openly opposed tyranny and injustice. Unlike the philosopher Euphrates, who wanted to abolish the monarchy and restore the republic, Apollonius believed a monarchy was best for the Empire. However, he longed for a wise and faithful ruler to lead humanity.So, although Apollonius supported Vespasian as long as he tried to follow noble ideals, he immediately criticized him when he stripped Greek cities of their freedoms. "You have enslaved Greece," he wrote. "You have turned a free people into slaves." Despite this criticism, Vespasian admitted in his final letter to his son Titus that their success was thanks to Apollonius' good advice.

Similarly, Apollonius traveled to Rome to confront Domitian. Even though Domitian tried to accuse him of plotting treason with Nerva, they couldn't find any political wrongdoing. Apollonius told the emperor that Nerva was a good man and not a traitor. Domitian didn't really suspect Apollonius of plotting against him; he imprisoned him hoping to get information about Nerva and other prominent men. Apollonius’ focus was not on politics but on advising leaders about virtue.

He spent a year and eight months with Vardan, King of Babylon, and was honored by the Indian Rajah "Phraotes."

## Section 12: Apollonius the Prophet and Wonder Worker

Now, let's look briefly at the part of Apollonius' life that has led to strong biases against him.Apollonius was not just a philosopher in the sense of being a theoretical thinker or someone who followed a disciplined lifestyle. He was a philosopher in the original Pythagorean sense—a person who understood Nature's secrets and could speak with authority. He knew Nature's hidden aspects firsthand, not just from what he heard. For him, philosophy was a way of life that turned him into a tool for knowledge. Religion, to Apollonius, was not just a matter of faith but also a science. He saw the surface of things as ever-changing appearances; to him, all religions and rituals were acceptable as long as they had the right spirit behind them.

Apollonius did not acknowledge differences in race or creed; such limitations were not for a philosopher. He would have found it amusing to hear the word "miracle" applied to his actions. The concept of "miracle" in its Christian theological sense was unknown in ancient times and is considered a remnant of superstition today. While many believe that the soul can achieve things beyond the scope of science, which is limited to physical forces, only the unthinking believe that there can be any interference with the natural laws set by Deity—the belief of Miraculists. Most of Apollonius's recorded wonders involved prophecy, seeing at a distance, recalling the past, having visions, healing the sick, or curing cases of possession.Even as a young man in the temple at Aegae, Apollonius showed signs of having basic psychic abilities. He accurately sensed the troubled past of a wealthy but unworthy man seeking to restore his eyesight, and he vaguely predicted the bad fate of someone who tried to harm his innocence. When he met Damis, who would become his loyal companion, Damis offered to help on their long journey to India, claiming he knew the languages of several countries they would travel through. Apollonius cryptically replied, "I understand them all, though I have learned none of them," and added, "Don't be surprised that I know all human languages, for I even know what people never say." By this, he meant he could read minds, not that he spoke all languages. However, Damis and Philostratus couldn't grasp this simple psychic ability and believed he knew the languages of all humans, birds, and animals.

In his conversation with the Babylonian king Vardan, Apollonius claimed he had foreknowledge. He said he was a healer of the soul and could cure the king's mental troubles, not just because he knew the right teachings from Pythagorean and similar schools, but also because he could foresee the king's nature. We're told that foreknowledge, a science Apollonius deeply studied, was a major topic of discussion between him and his Indian hosts. Apollonius explained to his philosophical friend, the Roman Consul Telesinus, that for him, wisdom was a kind of making divine of one's entire nature, a constant state of inspiration.Apollonius was believed to know everything of this nature due to his spiritual nature (vii. 10). For students of the Pythagorean and Platonic schools, a person's "daemon" was considered the higher self, the spiritual aspect of the soul, distinct from the purely human part. It represents the better part of a person, and when one's physical consciousness aligns with this "heavenly dweller," they gain the powers of "daemons," beings between Gods and men, according to ancient Greek mystic philosophy. If the living man aligns with his divine soul, he becomes a God on earth, and at an even higher stage, he becomes one with the Good and becomes God.

Thus, Apollonius strongly denied accusations of magic, which was believed to achieve its results through deals with low entities in the outermost realm of inner Nature. He also rejected the idea of being a soothsayer or diviner (p. 114). He had nothing to do with such arts; if he ever seemed to predict the future, it was due to "the wisdom which God reveals to the wise" (iv. 44). Many of the wonders attributed to Apollonius involve this type of foreknowledge or prophecy.

It's true that these recorded predictions are often obscure and cryptic, which is common with prophecy. Future events are frequently seen in symbolic forms, whose meanings become clear only after the events occur, or heard in similarly cryptic sentences. However, there are instances of precise foreknowledge, such as Apollonius refusing to board a ship that later sank during its voyage (v. 18).Instances of seeing distant events, like Apollonius witnessing the burning of a temple in Rome while in Alexandria, are quite clear. Even if people know nothing else about Apollonius of Tyana, they have at least heard how he saw the assassination of Domitian in Rome while he was in Ephesus, exactly when it happened.

According to Philostratus, it was midday, and Apollonius was in a park in the suburbs, giving a lecture on philosophy. Initially, he lowered his voice as if worried. He continued speaking, but hesitantly and with less energy than usual, as if distracted by something else. Eventually, he stopped speaking altogether, unable to find his words. Then, staring at the ground, he suddenly moved forward a few steps and shouted, "Strike the tyrant; strike!" He did this not like someone seeing a reflection but as if he were witnessing the actual event.

Turning to his surprised audience, he explained what he had seen. Though they hoped it was true, they didn't believe him and thought he had lost his mind. Apollonius calmly responded, "You are right to wait for the news to be confirmed in the usual way; as for me, I will give thanks to the Gods for what I have seen myself."

It's no surprise, then, that we read about symbolic dreams and their interpretations, a significant part of the esoteric teachings of his school. (See especially sections i. 23 and iv. 34.)We are not surprised to learn that Apollonius, using his inner knowledge, helped save an innocent man from execution in Alexandria. He also seemed to know the secret pasts of many people he met. Such abilities are becoming more familiar to us today with advancements in psychic science. Instances of curing diseases through mesmerism or "casting out evil spirits" should not astonish us if we consider the Gospel stories and the historical context where such healings were common. However, we should not fully believe the exaggerated accounts by Philostratus.

If Apollonius successfully treated mental cases like those in modern hospitals, which remain unsolved by conventional science due to a lack of understanding of the real causes, it is clear that Damis and Philostratus did not grasp the full picture and let their imaginations run wild in their stories. Sometimes, Philostratus might just be repeating popular legends, such as the story of Apollonius curing the plague in Ephesus. According to legend, the plague was caused by an old beggar who was buried under stones by the angry crowd. When Apollonius had the stones removed, it was found that the beggar had turned into a mad dog foaming at the mouth.On the contrary, the story of Apollonius bringing a young noble girl back to life in Rome is told with great restraint. It appears that Apollonius encountered the funeral procession by chance. He then approached the bier, made some gestures over the girl, and said some inaudible words, which seemed to wake her from death. Damis says, "Whether Apollonius noticed a spark of life that her friends missed—it was lightly raining and a slight vapor appeared on her face—or whether he actually revived her, neither he nor anyone present could say."

Other remarkable stories include Apollonius making the writing disappear from his accuser's tablets before Tigellinus, freeing his leg from fetters to show Damis he wasn't truly imprisoned despite being chained in Domitian's dungeons, and "disappearing" from the tribunal.

However, Apollonius did not ignore the study of physical phenomena in favor of inner science. He often rejected mythology for physical explanations of natural events. For example, he explained the volcanic activity of Mount Etna and a tidal wave in Crete, correctly predicting the resulting island formation due to an underwater disturbance. He also explained the tides at Cadiz in a similar manner.

## Section 13: His Way of Life

Let's now offer the reader some insights into Apollonius's lifestyle and teaching methods, which have already been touched upon in the "Early Life" section. Apollonius was a passionate follower of Pythagorean principles. In fact, Philostratus suggests he made more extraordinary efforts to achieve wisdom than even Pythagoras himself.

The outer practices of Pythagoras’s discipline are summarized by our author as follows: He wouldn't wear anything made from a dead animal, touch any food that once had life, or offer such things in sacrifice. Instead of staining altars with blood, he offered honey-cakes and incense, and his songs to the Gods. He believed the Gods preferred these offerings over the slaughter of hundreds of oxen.

Pythagoras claimed to communicate with the Gods, learning from them what pleased and displeased them, and thus obtained his knowledge of nature. He said that others only guessed at the divine and held conflicting opinions about the Gods. But Apollo himself appeared to Pythagoras openly, and Athena, the Muses, and other unnamed Gods also visited him in disguise.

Because of this, his followers saw Pythagoras as an inspired teacher and accepted his rules as law. They particularly adhered to the rule of silence concerning divine knowledge.The followers of Pythagoras often experienced profound and indescribable insights, which they found difficult to keep to themselves. However, they learned that it was this very silence that communicated these insights to them. This was a key aspect of the Pythagorean discipline, according to its adherents. However, Apollonius, in his speech to the Gymnosophists, claimed that Pythagoras did not create this wisdom; it was ancient and Pythagoras had learned it from the Indians.

This wisdom spoke to him in his youth, saying:

"Young man, I offer no pleasures for the senses; my path is filled with hardships. To follow my way of life, you must give up all food that was once alive, forget about wine, and keep your soul pure. You will not wear wool or anything made from animals. My followers wear simple shoes and sleep as they can. If they succumb to physical pleasures, I have punishments ready, for I am strict with those who choose my path. I even impose silence.

But if you endure, you will gain a sense of what is right and fair, and never feel anyone else's life is better than yours. You will make tyrants fear you instead of being afraid of them. The gods will bless your modest offerings more than the sacrifices of others. If you remain pure, I will grant you the ability to foresee events and fill your eyes with light so you can recognize the gods, identify heroes, and see through deceptive appearances."The entire life of Apollonius illustrates his consistent effort to follow a rule of life that avoided blood sacrifices, which he openly condemned. This stance shows that the Pythagorean school promoted purer offerings and were seen as particularly holy, living a life superior to that of ordinary people. Abstaining from animal flesh was not only about purity but also about a love for all living creatures and a horror of causing them pain. For example, when invited to join a hunt by the king of Babylon, Apollonius refused, saying, “Sire, have you forgotten that I do not even attend sacrifices? I would never kill these animals, especially when they are confined and their spirits are broken” (i. 38).

However, although Apollonius was strict with himself, he did not want to impose his lifestyle on others, including his friends and companions, unless they chose it willingly. He told Damis that he did not want to stop him from eating meat and drinking wine; he just wanted the right to abstain and to defend his actions if questioned (ii, 7). This also indicates that Damis was not part of Apollonius's inner circle of discipline, explaining why he, despite being a loyal follower, was often unaware of certain teachings.Apollonius advised Rajah Phraotes, his first host in India, against adopting his strict lifestyle, as it would distance him from his subjects (ii. 37). Apollonius prayed and meditated three times daily: at daybreak (vi. 10, 18; vii. 31), midday (vii. 10), and sunset (viii. 13). This routine was consistent, regardless of his location. He worshipped the "Sun," symbolizing the Lord of our world and its sister worlds.

In his "Early Life," Apollonius divided his day and allocated time for different groups of listeners and inquirers. His teaching style was straightforward and unaffected, unlike a rhetorician or professional speaker. He spoke directly and confidently, using phrases like "I know," "Methinks," "Why do you," and "You should know." His sentences were concise and effective, delivering clear and convincing messages. He no longer sought knowledge as in his youth but focused on teaching what he knew (i. 17). Instead of using Socratic questioning, he encouraged his listeners to listen to the inner voice of philosophy (iv. 2). He used everyday events to illustrate his points and aimed to improve his audience (iv. 3; vi. 3, 38).

When put on trial, Apollonius made no preparations for his defense. He lived each day ready for death and chose to face it in the name of philosophy (viii. 30).In response to his old friend's repeated requests to prepare his defense, he said:

"Damis, you seem to lose your senses in the face of death, even though you have been with me for so long and know that I have loved philosophy since my youth. I thought you were both ready for death and aware of my approach to it. Just as soldiers need not only courage but also strategy to know when to fight, those who love wisdom must carefully choose the right time to die, so they are not caught unprepared. I have chosen the best moment to face death, if anyone wishes to kill me, and I have demonstrated this to other friends in your presence, never ceasing to teach you this alone" (vii. 31).

These are some examples of how our philosopher lived, fearing nothing but disloyalty to his ideals. Now, we will mention some of his personal traits and the names of his followers.

## Section 14: Himself and His Circle

Apollonius is said to have been very handsome (i. 7, 12; iv. 1), but we have no detailed description of his appearance. His manner was always mild and gentle (i. 36; ii. 22) and modest (iv. 31; viii. 15). Damis noted that he was more like an Indian than a Greek (iii. 36), though he occasionally expressed indignation at particular atrocities (iv. 30).His mood was often thoughtful, and when he wasn't speaking, he would spend a long time deep in thought, with his eyes fixed on the ground. Although he was very strict with himself, he was always ready to excuse others. He praised the bravery of the few who stayed with him in Rome and did not blame the many who fled. His kindness was not just about avoiding blame; he actively performed acts of compassion. He liked to be called "Tyanean," though we don't know why. Apollonius didn't seem particularly proud of his birthplace, even though he loved Greece and other countries equally. He was a true citizen of the world and a priest of universal religion, without any bias toward any particular land or sect.

Despite his strict lifestyle, he was strong and healthy even at eighty years old, with a sound body and good posture. He had an indefinable charm that made him more pleasant to look at than youth, even though his face was wrinkled. Statues in the temple at Tyana depicted him this way during Philostratus's time. According to his biographer, people praised Apollonius's charm in old age more than the beauty of Alcibiades in his youth.In short, our philosopher seemed to be very charming and likable, and he was completely dedicated to philosophy, but not in a hermit-like way. He lived among people, so it's no surprise that he attracted many followers and disciples. It would have been interesting if Philostratus had provided more details about these "Apollonians" (viii. 21), and whether they formed a distinct school, were organized in communities like the Pythagoreans, or were just independent students drawn to a leading philosopher of the time.

However, it is certain that many of them dressed like him and followed his lifestyle (iv. 39). They often traveled with Apollonius (iv. 47; v. 21; viii. 19, 21, 24), sometimes as many as ten at a time, but none were allowed to speak to others until they had completed a vow of silence (v. 43). The most prominent of his followers were Musonius, who was considered the greatest philosopher after Apollonius and suffered under Nero's tyranny (iv. 44; v. 19; vii. 16), and Demetrius, "who loved Apollonius" (iv. 25, 42; v. 19; vi. 31; vii. 10; viii. 10). These names are well-known in history. Other lesser-known followers include the Egyptian Dioscorides, who stayed behind due to poor health on the long journey to Ethiopia (iv. 11, 38; v. 43), Menippus, whom Apollonius freed from an obsession (iv. 25, 38; v. 43), Phaedimus (iv. 11), Nilus, who joined from the Gymnosophists (v. 10 sqq., 28), and of course Damis, who claimed to be with him from their meeting at Ninus.

Overall, we believe that Apollonius did not create any new organization; he used existing ones, and his followers were those personally drawn to him by a strong affection that could only be satisfied by staying close to him. It seems clear that he did not train anyone to continue his work; he came and went, offering help and enlightenment, but he did not establish any tradition or school to be continued by others.

Even to his loyal companion Damis, when saying goodbye for the last time on earth, he did not speak of the work to which he had dedicated his life, but which Damis had never understood. His final words were for Damis alone, the man who loved him but never truly knew him. He promised to come to him if he needed help. "Damis, whenever you think deeply in solitude, you shall see me" (viii. 28).

Next, we will consider some of the sayings attributed to Apollonius and the speeches written by Philostratus. The shorter sayings are likely authentic traditions, but the speeches are mostly artistic elaborations of Damis's rough notes. They are explicitly stated to be so, but they are still interesting for two reasons. First, they openly acknowledge their nature and do not claim to be inspired; they are human documents that aim to give a literary form to the traditional ideas and efforts that the philosopher's life instilled in his listeners.The method was common in ancient times, and the ancient creators of other important documents would have been amazed to see how future generations would idolize their work and consider it directly inspired by the source of all wisdom. Additionally, although we are not reading the exact words of Apollonius, we still feel closely connected to the best religious thoughts of the Greek mind. We can see a picture of a spiritual and mystical movement that influenced all levels of society in the first century AD.

### Section 14 Footnotes

Rathgeber (G.), in his "Grossgriechenland and Pythagoras" (Gotha; 1866), a work of incredible bibliographical effort, mentions three supposed portraits of Apollonius (p. 621): (i) In the Campidoglio Museum of the Vatican, listed in "Indicazione delle Sculture" (Rome; 1840), p. 68, nos. 75, 76, 77; (ii) in the Musee Royal Bourbon, described by Michel B. (Naples; 1837), p. 79, no. 363; (iii) a contorniate reproduced by Visconti. I cannot trace his first reference, but in a "Guide pour le Musee Royal Bourbon," translated by C. J. J. (Naples; 1831), I find on p. 152 that no. 363 is a bust of Apollonius, 2 3/4 feet high, carefully crafted, with a Zeus-like head, having a beard and long hair falling onto the shoulders, tied with a deep band. The bust appears to be ancient. However, I have not been able to find a reproduction of it. Visconti (E. Q.), in the atlas of his "Iconographie Grecque" (Paris; 1808), vol. i. plate 17, facing p. 68, provides a reproduction of a contorniate, or medal with a circular border, showing a head of Apollonius and the Latin legend "APOLLONIVS TEANEVS." This also depicts our philosopher with a beard and long hair; the head is crowned, and the upper part of the body is covered with a tunic and a philosopher's cloak.The medal, however, is of very poor quality, and the portrait is not at all appealing. Visconti, in his writings, dedicates an angry and disdainful paragraph to Apollonius, calling him "that too famous impostor," based on De Tillemont.

## Section 15: From His Sayings and Sermons

APOLLONIUS believed in prayer, but in a very different way from most people. To him, the idea that the gods could be persuaded to change their strict sense of justice by human pleas was blasphemous. He found it unthinkable that the gods could be involved in our selfish hopes and fears. He believed that the gods were only responsible for delivering justice and giving people what they deserved. The common belief, which still exists today, that God can be influenced or that deals can be made with Him or His agents, was completely repulsive to Apollonius. Beings that could be swayed and manipulated were not gods but lesser than humans.

As a young man, Apollonius had a conversation with one of the priests of Aesculapius and said: "Since the gods know everything, I think someone with a clear conscience should pray like this: 'Give me, gods, what I deserve!'" On his long journey to India, he prayed in Babylon: "God of the sun, send me across the earth as far as it is good for you and me; and may I come to know the good, and never know the bad, nor the bad know me." One of his most common prayers, according to Damis, was: "Grant me, gods, to have little and need nothing..

When the Pontifex Maximus Telesinus asked Apollonius, "When you enter the temples, what do you pray for?" Apollonius replied, "I pray that righteousness may prevail, the laws remain unbroken, the wise remain poor, and others be rich, but honestly."The philosopher's belief in the grand ideal of having nothing yet possessing everything is shown by his reply to the officer who asked how he dared enter Babylon without permission. "The whole earth is mine," said Apollonius, "and I am free to travel through it." There are many instances where Apollonius was offered money for his services, but he always refused, and so did his followers. When King Vardan generously offered them gifts, they turned away. Apollonius remarked, "You see, my hands, though many, are all alike." When the king asked what gift Apollonius would bring back from India, he replied, "A gift that will please you, sire. If my stay there makes me wiser, I shall return better than I am."

While crossing the great mountains into India, Apollonius had a conversation with Damis that illustrates how he used everyday events to teach higher lessons. Damis remarked that yesterday they were in the valley (below) and today they were high in the mountains (above), close to heaven. Apollonius gently asked if that's what he meant by "below" and "above." Impatiently, Damis confirmed and questioned the need for such a seemingly pointless inquiry. Apollonius then asked if being nearer to heaven on the mountain tops had brought him any closer to understanding the divine. He questioned whether those who observe the heavens from the mountains have a greater understanding of things.To tell the truth, replied Damis, somewhat disappointed, I did think I would come down wiser, for I've been up a higher mountain than any of them, but I fear I know no more than before I ascended it. Nor do other men, replied Apollonius. Such observations make them see the heavens more blue, the stars larger, and the sunrise from the night, things known to those who tend sheep and goats. But how God cares for humankind, how He finds pleasure in their service, and what virtue, righteousness, and common sense are, neither Athos will reveal to those who climb its summit, nor Olympus, which stirs the poet's wonder, unless the soul perceives them. For should the soul, when pure and unalloyed, attempt such heights, I swear to you, it wings its flight far beyond this lofty Caucasus.

So again, when at Thermopylae, his followers were disputing which was the highest ground in Greece, with Mt. Oeta in view. They happened to be just at the foot of the hill where the Spartans fell, overwhelmed with arrows. Climbing to the top of it, Apollonius cried out: "And I think this is the highest ground, for those who fell here for freedom's sake have made it as high as Oeta and raised it far above a thousand Olympuses."

Another instance of how Apollonius turned chance happenings to good account is the following. Once at Ephesus, in one of the covered walks near the city, he was speaking of sharing our goods with others, and how we ought mutually to help one another. It happened that a number of sparrows were sitting on a tree nearby in perfect silence. Suddenly another sparrow flew up and began chirping, as though it wanted to tell the others something. Whereupon the little fellows all started chirping too, and flew away after the newcomer. Apollonius' superstitious audience were greatly struck by this behavior of the sparrows, thinking it was an omen of some important matter.But the philosopher continued with his speech. The sparrow, he said, invited his friends to a feast. A boy had slipped in a nearby lane and spilled some corn he was carrying in a bowl. He picked up most of it and went away. The little sparrow found the scattered grains and immediately flew off to invite his friends to the feast. Most of the crowd then ran to see if it was true. When they came back, excited and amazed, the philosopher continued: "You see how the sparrows care for one another and happily share what they have. Yet we humans do not approve. If we see a man sharing his goods with others, we call it wasteful and extravagant, and we label the recipients as fawners and parasites. So, what is left for us but to shut ourselves up at home like fattening birds, stuffing ourselves in the dark until we burst with fat?"

On another occasion, in Smyrna, Apollonius saw a ship preparing to set sail and used the moment to teach a lesson about cooperation. "Look at the ship's crew!" he said. "Some man the boats, others raise and secure the anchors, some set the sails to catch the wind, while others keep watch at the bow and stern. If even one man fails in his duties or makes a mistake, their sailing will be poor, and they will face a storm. But if they compete to ensure no one seems worse than the others, their journey will be smooth, and they will enjoy good weather and a safe voyage."

Again, on another occasion in Rhodes, Damis asked him if he thought anything was greater than the famous Colossus. "I do," replied Apollonius. "The man who walks wisely on paths that lead to health."Here are some examples of witty or sarcastic responses attributed to our philosopher. Despite usually being serious, he often teased his listeners and sometimes made fun of their foolishness (see especially iv. 30). This trait showed even in dangerous times. A notable example is his reply to Tigellinus's risky question, "What do you think of Nero?" Apollonius answered, "I think better of him than you do. You think he should sing, and I think he should stay silent" (iv. 44).

Another example is his witty and wise rebuke to a wealthy young man. "Young man," he said, "it seems that your house owns you, not the other way around" (v. 22). Similarly, he responded to a boastful glutton who compared himself to Hercules, known for his eating as well as his labors. "Yes," said Apollonius, "but he was Hercules. What virtue do you have, you heap of trash? Your only claim to fame is that you might burst" (iv. 23).

On more serious occasions, like when Vespasian earnestly asked him, "Teach me what a good king should do," Apollonius is said to have replied with something like this:

"You ask something that can't be taught. Kingship is the greatest thing a mortal can achieve; it can't be taught. But I will tell you what to do to be a good king. Don't value wealth that is hoarded—how is that better than sand randomly piled up? Nor wealth that comes from heavily taxing people—gold acquired through suffering is vile. You'll use wealth best if you meet the needs of the poor and protect the wealth of those who have much. Be wary of the power to do whatever you want, and you'll use it more wisely."Don't cut off the ears of corn that stand out taller than the others—Aristotle's advice here isn't fair. Instead, remove the discontent like weeds from the corn, and make it clear to troublemakers that you are a force to be reckoned with—not by saying "I will punish you," but by implying "I will do so." Follow the law, O prince, because you will create better laws if you respect the law yourself. Honor the Gods even more; you have received great gifts from them and pray for great things. Act like a king in matters of the state, but in personal matters, behave like an ordinary person.

The passage continues with similar advice, demonstrating a deep understanding of human nature. If we think this is just a rhetorical exercise by Philostratus and not based on what Apollonius actually said, we must hold a higher opinion of the rhetorician than his other works suggest.
There is an interesting Socratic dialogue between Thespesion, the leader of the Gymnosophist community, and Apollonius about the Greek and Egyptian ways of representing the Gods. It goes somewhat like this:

"What! Are we to believe," said Thespesion, "that artists like Phidias and Praxiteles went to heaven, observed the forms of the Gods, and then created their art based on that, or was it something else that inspired them?" "Yes, something else," replied Apollonius, "something filled with wisdom." "What was that? Surely, you can't say it was anything other than imitation?" "It was imagination—a craft far wiser than imitation; for imitation only recreates what it has seen, while imagination creates what it has never seen, envisioning it in its true essence." According to Apollonius, imagination is one of the most powerful faculties because it allows us to get closer to the truth.It is commonly believed that Greek sculpture was solely a celebration of physical beauty, lacking any spiritual significance. It was seen as an idealization of form, features, limbs, and muscles—an empty praise of the physical without any true basis in reality. However, Apollonius argued that Greek sculpture brings us closer to the truth, as Pythagoras and Plato had also claimed, and as wise people continue to teach. He meant this literally, not in a vague or fanciful way. He stated that the types and ideas of things are the only true realities. He believed that between the imperfections of the earth and the highest divine forms, there are levels of increasing perfection. He also believed that within each person exists a form of perfection, though not yet absolutely perfect. The angel within a person, or their daemon, possesses a God-like beauty, summing up all the finest features they had ever displayed in their many lives on earth. The Gods, too, belong to this world of types, models, and perfections—the heaven-world. Greek sculptors managed to connect with this world using their imagination. This idealization of form was a fitting way to represent the Gods. However, Apollonius argued that if you place a hawk, owl, or dog in your temples to represent Hermes, Athena, or Apollo, you might elevate the animals, but you diminish the Gods' dignity.

Thespesion responded that the Egyptians do not dare to give any precise form to the Gods; they only provide symbols with hidden meanings. Apollonius agreed but pointed out that the danger is that ordinary people might end up worshipping these symbols and form unflattering ideas of the Gods. He concluded that the best approach would be to have no representations at all, as the mind of the worshipper can create an image of the object of worship better than any artwork can.Sure, here's a modernized and simplified version of the text:

"Exactly," replied Thespesion with a mischievous smile. "There was an old Athenian, Socrates, who wasn't a fool, and he swore by a dog and goose as if they were gods." Apollonius answered, "Yes, Socrates wasn't a fool. He swore by them not because they were gods, but to avoid swearing by the actual gods."

This witty exchange, showing an Egyptian against a Greek, is more about the rhetorical skills of Philostratus than Apollonius. Apollonius, who was a priest of a universal religion, might have highlighted the good and bad aspects of both Greek and Egyptian religious art. He certainly advocated for a higher form of worship without symbols, but he wouldn't have favored one popular religion over another. The speech clearly shows a bias against Egypt and praises Greece, a theme present in several other speeches. Philostratus was a strong defender of Greece, but we believe Apollonius was wiser than his biographer. Despite the elaborate literary style of Apollonius' longer discourses, they contain many noble ideas, as shown in the following quotes from his conversations with his friend Demetrius, who tried to persuade him not to confront Domitian in Rome.

"The law," said Apollonius, "requires us to die for freedom, and nature demands that we die for our parents, friends, or children. Everyone has these obligations. But a higher duty binds the sage; he must die for his principles and the truth he values more than life. This choice isn't imposed by law or nature; it comes from the strength and courage of his own soul."Even if faced with fire or sword, he remains steadfast and will not utter a single lie. He guards the secrets entrusted to him with the same dedication as he would sacred initiations. I understand more than most because I recognize that some of my knowledge benefits others, some is for the wise, some is personal, and some is divine, but none is for tyrants. A wise man never acts alone; even his most private thoughts have his own conscience as a witness. Whether the saying "know thyself" originated from Apollo or a sage, I believe a wise man who truly knows himself will not fear what common people dread nor act shamefully like many do. This passage shows the true philosopher's disdain for death and the calm assurance of someone who keeps others' secrets, knowing no torture can break his silence. It also speaks to the deep understanding of consciousness and the impossibility of concealing inner evil, highlighting an ethical standard that makes the behavior of most people seem surprising--that they act without shame.

## Section 16: From His Letters

Apollonius seems to have written many letters to emperors, kings, philosophers, communities, and states. Although he didn't write extensively, his short notes were very concise, as Philostratus notes, "in the manner of the Lacedaemonian scytale" (iv. 27 and vii. 35). Philostratus had access to letters attributed to Apollonius and quotes many of them, with no reason to doubt their authenticity. He does not specify where he got them, except possibly from a collection made by Hadrian at Antium (viii. 20). To show the style of Apollonius, here are a few examples of his letters, or rather notes, since they are very brief. Here is one to the magistrates of Sparta:

"Apollonius to the Ephors, greetings! People can avoid mistakes, but it takes noble men to admit them."

Apollonius expressed this in half as many words in Greek. Here is an exchange of notes between two great philosophers of the time, both of whom were imprisoned and constantly in danger of death:

"Apollonius to Musonius, the philosopher, greetings! I want to visit you, share conversation and shelter, and offer help. If you still believe that Hercules once rescued Theseus from Hades, let me know what you need. Farewell!"

"Musonius to Apollonius, the philosopher, greetings! Your good intentions will be rewarded. As for me, I await trial and hope to prove my innocence. Farewell."

"Apollonius to Musonius, greetings! Socrates refused to escape from prison and faced his judges. He was executed. Farewell."Musonius to Apollonius, the philosopher, greetings! "Socrates was executed because he didn't prepare a defense. I will, though. Farewell!" Musonius, the Stoic, was sent to hard labor by Nero. Here’s a note to Demetrius, the Cynic, another close friend of our philosopher. "Apollonius, the philosopher, to Demetrius, the Dog, greetings! I entrust you to teach Emperor Titus the ways of kingship, and in return, help me speak the truth to him. Be everything to him except angry. Farewell!.
Besides the notes quoted by Philostratus, there is a collection of ninety-five letters, mostly brief, in most editions. Nearly all critics believe they aren’t genuine, but Jowett and others think some might be. Here are a few examples. Writing to Euphrates, his great enemy who champions pure rationalistic ethics over sacred science, he says:

1.  "The Persians call those with divine abilities Magi. A Magus is a servant of the gods or someone naturally god-like. You are no Magus; you reject the gods (i.e., you are an atheist)." In a letter to Criton, he writes:

2.  "Pythagoras said the most divine art is healing. If healing is divine, it must care for the soul as well as the body; no being can be healthy if its higher part is ill." Writing to the priests of Delphi against blood sacrifice, he says:

3.  "Heraclitus was wise, but even he never advised the people of Ephesus to clean mud with mud."

Again, to some who claimed to be his followers, those "who think themselves wise," he writes a reprimand:

43.If anyone claims to be my disciple, they should also say they avoid public baths, do not kill any living being, do not eat meat, and are free from envy, malice, hatred, slander, and hostility. Their name should be listed among those who have achieved freedom.

Among these letters is one addressed to Valerius, likely P. Valerius Asiaticus, consul in A.D. 70. This letter offers wise philosophical advice to help Valerius cope with the loss of his son. It reads:

"There is no real death, only the appearance of it, just as there is no true birth, only the semblance of it. What seems like birth is merely a transition from being to becoming, and what appears as death is just a shift from becoming to being. In truth, no one is ever truly born or dies. It's simply a matter of being visible and then invisible; the former due to the density of matter, and the latter due to the subtlety of being—being that remains constant, only changing between motion and rest. This being has the unique quality that its changes are not caused by anything external but involve the whole becoming parts and parts becoming whole within the oneness of everything. If asked what this entity is that sometimes appears and sometimes doesn't, now the same, now different, the answer would be: It is the nature of everything in the world below. When filled with matter, it is visible due to the resistance of its density, but when free from matter, it becomes invisible due to its subtlety, even though matter still surrounds and flows through it in the vastness of space, which knows no birth or death.

But why has this mistaken idea of birth and death persisted so long without being refuted? Some people believe that events happening through them are caused by themselves."They do not understand that an individual is born through parents, not by them, just as something produced from the earth is not created by it. The change that happens to a person is not caused by the visible surroundings but by the essence within each individual. What else can we call this essence but primal being? It alone acts and experiences, becoming everything for everyone, an eternal deity, deprived and altered by names and forms.

It is less serious for a person to be mourned when they have transformed from human to divine, a change of state rather than a destruction of nature. Instead of mourning death, you should honor and respect it. The best way to honor death is to leave the one who has gone to God in peace and continue to lead those who remain under your care. It would be a disgrace for someone like you to rely on time for healing rather than reason, for time eventually makes even ordinary people stop grieving. The greatest achievement is self-control, and the best rulers are those who can first rule themselves.

How can it be acceptable to wish to change what God has willed? If there is a law in things, and it is set by God, a righteous person will not wish to alter good things, as such a wish is selfish and against the law. Instead, they will believe that everything that happens is good. Heal yourself, provide justice to the suffering, and console them; this will help you overcome your sorrow. You should prioritize public duties over personal grief. Remember, the nation mourns with you for your son.Offer some comfort to those who mourn with you; you can do this more effectively by stopping your own tears rather than continuing to cry. Do you not have friends? You still have another child. Do you believe you have lost the one who has passed away? You have not! Anyone who truly thinks will understand. What exists does not cease; it remains because it is eternal. If it did not exist, how could it ever have been?

Moreover, some might say you are being unfaithful to God and unjust. This is true. You are failing in your duty to God and being unfair to your child. By continuing to mourn excessively, you are also being unkind to yourself. Do you want to understand what death is? Consider me dead and send me to join the deceased. If you do not change your current mindset, you will soon find that I am better off than you.Apollonius of Tyana, by G.R.S. Mead, [1901], at sacred-texts.com

## Section 17: The Writings of Apollonius

Besides his letters, Apollonius wrote several treatises, though only a few fragments have survived. These treatises include:

a. The Mystic Rites or Concerning Sacrifices. Philostratus mentions this work, noting that it detailed the proper methods for sacrifices to each god, the appropriate times for prayer, and offerings. It was widely circulated, with copies found in many temples, cities, and philosophers' libraries. Several fragments remain, the most significant of which is found in Eusebius. It states: "It is best not to make any sacrifice to God, not to light a fire, or to call Him by any name used for earthly things. For God is above all, the first; the other gods come after Him. He needs nothing from the gods, and even less from us humans—nothing from the earth, from life, or from the air. The only fitting sacrifice to God is our best reason, not words from our mouths. We should ask the best being for what is good through our minds, which need no material things to pray. Therefore, no sacrifice should be lit for the mighty One above all." Scholars agree this fragment is genuine. This book was respected and widely circulated, with its rules engraved on bronze pillars in Byzantium.

b. The Oracles or Concerning Divination, 4 books. Philostratus mentions this work as well.41) believes the full title was "Divination of the Stars" and says it was based on what Apollonius had learned in India. However, the type of divination Apollonius wrote about was not ordinary astrology but something Philostratus considers superior to typical human methods. No one has ever been known to possess a copy of this rare work.

c. "The Life of Pythagoras." Porphyry mentions this work, and Iamblichus quotes a long passage from it.

d. "The Will of Apollonius," previously referenced when discussing Philostratus's sources (i. 3), was written in the Ionic dialect and summarized his doctrines. He is also credited with a "Hymn to Memory," and Eudocia mentions many other works.

We've now provided all the available information about our philosopher. Was Apollonius a fraud, a trickster, a fanatic, or was he a philosopher, a reformer, a true initiate, one of the great ones? Each person must decide based on their knowledge or ignorance. For my part, I honor his memory and would gladly learn from him as he is now.

Marquardt and Mommsen's "Handbook of Roman Antiquities" (Leipzig, 1878) offers an excellent summary with valuable notes, especially the section "Replacement of the Gentes by the Sodalitates for Foreign Cults." Boissier's "The Roman Religion from Augustus to the Antonines" (Paris, 2nd ed., 1878) covers this topic in detail, specifically in volume ii, pages 238-304 (1st ed. 1874).

Hatch's "The Organization of the Early Christian Churches: The Bampton Lectures for 1880" (London, 2nd ed., 1882) is also important, especially Lecture ii, "Bishops and Deacons," on pages 26-32. The German edition, "The Social Structure of Christian Churches in Antiquity" (1883), page 20, includes additional literature on the subject.

Newmann's article "Thiasutai Iesou" in "Yearbook for Protestant Theology" (Leipzig, 1885), pages 123-125, is another useful resource. Schürer's "A History of the Jewish People in the Time of Jesus Christ" (English translation, Edinburgh, 1893), Division ii, volume ii, pages 255 and 300, provides further insights. Owen's "On the Organization of the Early Church," an introductory essay in the English translation of Harnack's "Sources of the Apostolic Canons" (London, 1895), is also recommended.

Lastly, Anst's "The Religion of the Romans," volume xiii of "Studies in Non-Christian Religious History" (Münster, 1899), is a noteworthy source.

For additional reference, see Whiston and Wayte's article "Arval Brothers," and Moyle's articles "Collegium" and "Universitas" in Smith, Wayte, and Marindin's "Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities" (London, 3rd ed., 1890-1891). The articles "Collegium" and "Sodalitas" in Pauly's "Encyclopedia of Classical Antiquities" are also useful, though somewhat outdated.

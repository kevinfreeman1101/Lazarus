## Introduction

Before the canonical Gospels were established, many other accounts of Jesus' sayings and actions existed. Similarly, before the official Acts were chosen, there were numerous other narratives claiming to record the deeds and words of Jesus' Apostles and Disciples. Many of these originated in groups later deemed heretical, and were often edited by orthodox editors to fit their doctrinal views, thus preserving them for the broader Church.

As Lipsius explains: "Editors frequently altered these narratives, removing anything that didn't align with their theological perspectives—such as dogmatic statements, speeches, and prayers—replacing them with their own compositions, and making further changes as they saw fit."

Despite being mostly fragmented today, some of these documents still show signs of their Gnostic origins. Lipsius demonstrated that this Gnosticism is linked to the broader Gnosis of the second century, rather than to third-century Manichaeism as previously thought.

In the second century, these religious stories were widely circulated and served as a primary means of Gnostic public outreach. The orthodox Church Fathers later attacked Gnostic teachings, often misrepresenting and ridiculing them. The Gnostics did not respond to these attacks, likely because they were sworn to secrecy and understood that the mysteries of the inner life couldn't be settled through common debate.

Their mystical teachings were meant for those who had direct experience of the inner life; to others, these teachings seemed foolish. Their narratives often drew from real spiritual experiences, which were then adapted into popular stories. The complex and profound nature of these spiritual experiences, along with the specialized terminology that appealed to Gnostic insiders, were simplified for a broader audience.

While these stories might seem fantastical to us today, they were entirely believable to all branches of Christianity at the time. The orthodox Christians did not deny the miraculous elements of these tales; what they strongly opposed were the doctrinal implications. These narratives served as a bridge between mainstream Christianity and Gnostic teachings, and they were too popular to be dismissed through ridicule alone.

According to Lipsius, Catholic bishops and teachers countered the spread of Gnostic writings by adopting the most popular stories, removing their doctrinal content, and then offering these sanitized versions to the public. However, this purification was not entirely successful, and some of the original Gnostic ideas survived. We are thankful for many beautiful things, especially for the preservation of the Hymn of Jesus.

The earliest collection of these Gnostic Acts is said to have been compiled by a man named Leucius Charinus. There is a somewhat doubtful tradition that Leucius was a disciple of John. If this is true, it would refer to John, the writer of the Fourth Gospel, not John, one of the original Twelve Apostles.

We won't delve into the complex issue of the authorship of the Gospel of John here. However, those interested in the Gnostic influences on the Fourth Gospel should read Kreyenbuhl's detailed and informative study "Das Evangelium der Wahrheit" (Berlin; 1900, 1905). Kreyenbuhl's "new solution to the Johannine question," which he calls "The Gospel of the Truth," claims that the Fourth Gospel has a direct Gnostic origin. He even argues that the author of this highly spiritual Gospel was Mænander, the teacher of Basilides. It's noteworthy that this significant work has been completely ignored in this country.

In any case, the Leucian Acts are ancient. According to Zahn, this collection was made before the Gnostics were considered heretical, around 130 A.D. However, Lipsius and Hennecke place them towards the end of the second century. They concede this latest possible date because Clement of Alexandria, at the end of the second century, quotes from the Gnostic Acts of John, which were undoubtedly part of the Leucian collection.

The debate between Lipsius and Zahn was influenced by their agreement that the Acts of John cite the Fourth Gospel. Zahn believed this Gospel was written earlier than Lipsius did and was eager to find in the Acts the earliest evidence of that Gospel. However, Corssen strongly contested whether the Acts quoted the Gospel at all; and from the passages I've seen, there doesn't seem to be clear proof of direct quotations. There's a definite similarity in wording, which is often the case with nearly contemporary documents, but it's easier to explain this by considering the writers to be from the same circle rather than accusing them of direct copying.

Regardless, we shouldn't assume Leucius invented the Acts; he collected, adapted, and wrote the material. If he had invented it all, he would have been a very talented individual. Leucius has his own style and operates within a certain pleasant atmosphere characteristic of the best of the Johannine tradition—marked by love, intimacy, and simplicity—which is quite different from the more formal Pauline atmosphere. The Acts of John are clearly Leucian, and judging by the literary style, so are the Acts of Peter. As for the rest of the Acts in the original Leucian collection, there is currently no certainty, and those attributed to Leucius by later writers should be set aside for now.

James speculated that just as Luke wrote the Orthodox Acts, the writer of the Gnostic Acts called himself Leucius to imply he was the same person. However, I find this highly unlikely. Generally, Gnostics are more often creators than imitators. It's interesting to note that Zahn believes the story of how the Fourth Gospel was created, as described by the writer of the Muratorian Fragment (around 170 A.D.), was taken from the Leucian Acts. According to this account, the Gospel was written by a man named John, who was one of the disciples. His fellow disciples and bishops encouraged him to write a Gospel, but John was reluctant to take on the responsibility. He suggested that they all fast for three days and share any revelations they received. That night, it was revealed to Andrew, one of the apostles, that John should write everything in his own name, while others would review it.

If this information came from the Leucian Acts, it indicates that the writer was familiar with the Fourth Gospel. If we accept this as true—though just from the similar phrases alone, I'm not entirely convinced—then the question arises: how could Leucius have attributed to John teachings that contradict the Gospel's message? James provides this answer: he believes St. John wrote simple and easy-to-understand stories for the general public, but delivered different teachings to a select group of faithful followers. In the Gospel and Epistles, we see his public teachings; in the Acts, his private ones.

This interpretation is the opposite of what Corssen believes, which is that the author of the Acts didn't know the Gospel at all. The general Gnostic view is that all true scripture has a deeper meaning. The gospel stories were written for the public, but also in a way that symbolically conveyed mysteries. If any effort was made to reveal these hidden mysteries in a clearer form, it required emphasizing a more spiritual perspective.

The popular narrative, usually understood in a physical and material way, was replaced by a more flexible and suggestive presentation. However, we might ask, especially regarding the Fourth Gospel: Was the Gospel written first, with the Gnostic reinterpretation coming later, or did Gnostic ideas exist before the Gospel was written, with the Gospel incorporating these pre-existing ideas?

Since it is now beyond doubt that Gnosis existed before Christianity, and that what is generally called Gnosticism is a Christianized version of Gnosis that existed during Paul's time, we must conclude that the latter scenario is not improbable. Furthermore, the Gnosticism in the Acts of John is broad and general, not tied to any specific school of Christian Gnosis.

The remarkable and beautiful Hymn discussed in this volume is found in the Leucian Acts of John. However, it is not certain that Leucius himself wrote the Hymn. Leucius was a collector and editor who used various sources, and I believe the Hymn existed in Gnostic circles before the Acts were composed, making it a highly valued document.

The first external evidence of our Hymn is its use by the Priscillianists in Spain in the late fourth century. The significant movement known as Priscillianism was a powerful revival of Gnosticism and Eastern mysticism and theosophy that spread across the region.

The Priscillianists viewed scripture similarly to other Gnostics; their canon was broad and inclusive. They believed that just as Jewish scriptures were an incomplete revelation compared to general Christian texts, the popular Christian scriptures were also imperfect compared to Gnostic revelations. The Old Testament books were seen as filled with symbols and shadows of Gospel teachings, and similarly, the New Testament books were considered symbolic of the deeper teachings of Gnosis. The Old Testament was for those with faith, while the New Testament was for those with Gnosis. Augustine and Jerome strongly opposed this view, as the country was inundated with many Gnostic documents.

The Priscillianists were persecuted and martyred, and the orthodox bishops focused on confiscating and destroying their books. Ceretius, likely a bishop, sent Augustine some Gnostic books and seemed somewhat supportive of them. In his response, Augustine critiqued one specific document—the Hymn. He wrote that this Hymn, claimed to be of Jesus Christ and highly revered, was usually found in apocryphal writings used by various heretics, not just the Priscillianists.

Augustine quoted from the introduction of the Gnostic manuscript of the Hymn, which stated:

> The Hymn of the Lord which He sang privately to the holy Apostles, His disciples, as mentioned in the Gospel: 'And after singing a hymn He ascended the mount.' This Hymn is not included in the canon because of those who follow their own thoughts rather than the Spirit and Truth of God, and it is written: 'It is good to hide the secret of the King; but it is honorable to reveal the works of God.'"The Gospel mentioned cannot be either Matthew (26:31) or Mark (14:26), both of which say: "And after singing a hymn they went out to the Mount of Olives." I cannot trace the second quotation. An important point to note is that Ceretius found the Hymn by itself, separate from its context in the Acts, likely extracted for liturgical purposes. Augustine's writings indicate that the Hymn was well-known in Gnostic circles. It also seems that Augustine, who wrote in Latin, was dealing with a Latin translation rather than translating the quotation himself in his response to Ceretius. Only part of the Greek text of this famous Hymn was known before 1899, when James published an important, previously unknown fragment of the Acts of John, found in a fourteenth-century manuscript in the Vienna Imperial Library. This fragment seems to contain the full text of the Hymn, though it was copied by a sometimes careless scribe. Most of this lengthy fragment is a monologue by John, preserving a remarkable tradition of the Gnostic view of the life of Jesus, or incidents in his "occult" life. The christology in this fragment is "docetic." This fragment is a valuable addition to our knowledge of Docetism and provides a solid reason why this view was widely held by the Gnostics. It is now our most important source on the topic and changes the entire discussion. In future discussions, this fragment must be considered the primary reference point. Docetism was a theory confirmed by narratives and legends of certain psychic or spiritual powers attributed to the "perfect man."The Christological and soteriological theories of the Gnostic philosophers were not entirely invented from scratch; they were based on a genuine historical fact that has mostly been obscured by numerous physical and objective historical narratives of the origins. After His death, I believe, as many Gnostic traditions claim, Christ returned and taught His disciples and true followers in private. This fact, which was revealed to their consciousness in many marvelous ways, significantly contributed to the Gnostic tradition of secret teachings. He returned in the only way possible—in a subtle or "spiritual" form or "body." This "body" could become visible at will and could even be felt, but compared to a normal physical body, it was an "illusory" body, hence the term "docetic." Similarly, as the external tradition of the original Jewish Christians, the Ebionites (or Poor), evolved and eventually elevated Jesus from a simple prophet to the full Power and Glory of Godhead, the internal tradition expanded the initially simple docetic idea into every aspect of the extensive soteriological structure built by Gnostic thinkers.The Leucian Acts of John relate to a later trend, and "John" represents a specific tradition of Docetism. This belief stemmed from significant spiritual experiences and teachings that were later woven into historical narratives. In the fragment, "John" summarizes this by saying, "I believed that the Lord designed everything symbolically for human conversion and salvation." This means that all inspired stories about Christ's actions and words are symbolic, showing that Christ operates within the Cosmic Order. This is His "mission" and "service"—fulfilling His "Father's will."

Now, let's turn to the hymn itself, first provided in Bonnet's text. In the newly-recovered fragment, it is introduced as follows: "Before He was captured by the lawless Jews—those under the influence of the lawless Serpent—He gathered us and said: 'Before I am handed over to them, we will sing a hymn to the Father and then face what lies ahead.'

He then asked us to form a circle by holding hands, with Him in the center, and said: 'Respond "Amen" to Me.' He began to sing a hymn and said:

THE HYMN

Glory to You, Father! (And we, moving in a circle, responded to Him:) Amen! Glory to You, Word (Logos)! Amen! Glory to You, Grace (Charis)! Amen! Glory to You, Spirit! Glory to You, Holy One! Glory to Your Glory! Amen! We praise You, O Father; We give thanks to You, O light; In Whom Darkness does not dwell! Amen! (For what we give thanks to the Logos). [Or, if we accept the "corrected" text: For what we give thanks, I say:] I want to be saved; and I want to save. Amen! I want to be freed; and I want to free. Amen!I would be hurt, and I would hurt. Amen! I would be born, and I would give birth. Amen! I would eat, and I would be eaten. Amen! I would listen, and I would be heard. Amen! I would understand, and I would be understood, being all Understanding (Nous). I would be cleansed, and I would cleanse. Amen! (Grace leads the dance.) I would play music; you all dance. Amen! I would play a dirge; you all lament. Amen! The Ogdoad (the number Eight) plays with us. Amen! The Twelfth number above leads the dance. Amen! All who are naturally inclined to dance, dance. Amen! Those who do not dance do not understand what is happening. Amen! I would leave, and I would stay. Amen! I would be adorned, and I would adorn. Amen! I would be united, and I would unite. Amen! I have no home, and I have many homes. Amen! I have no place, and I have many places. Amen! I have no temple, and I have many temples. Amen! I am a light for you who see Me. Amen! I am a mirror for you who understand Me. Amen! I am a door for you who knock. Amen! I am a way for you who travel. Amen! Now respond to My dancing! See yourself in Me who speaks; And seeing what I do, Keep silent about My Mysteries. Understand through dancing what I do; For you share in the Passion of Man That I am to suffer. You could not be aware Of your suffering, Were I not sent as your Word by the Father. Seeing what I suffer, You saw Me suffering; And seeing, you did not stand still, But were entirely moved, Moved to be wise. You have Me as a resting place; rest upon Me. You will know who I am when I leave. What I appear to be now, I am not. But what I am, you will see when you arrive.If you had known how to endure suffering, you would have the power to avoid suffering. Learn how to endure suffering, and you will gain the power to overcome it. What you do not know, I will teach you. I am your God, not a traitor. I wish to be in harmony with holy souls. In Me, find the Wisdom. Say to Me again: Glory to You, Father! Glory to You, Word! Glory to You, Holy Spirit! As for Me, if you want to know who I am: I am the Word who created everything and felt no shame. I danced and leaped with joy. Understand this, and say: Glory to You, Father! Amen! 

(After completing this dance with us, Beloved, the Lord departed. We, as if waking from a deep sleep, went our separate ways.)

COMMENTS: It seems almost certain to me, as I argued in the first edition of "Fragments of a Faith Forgotten" in 1900, that this is not a hymn but a mystery ritual, possibly the earliest Christian ritual we have. There are similar mystery rituals in Coptic Gnostic works, like the extracts from the "Books of the Saviour" in the Pistis Sophia document of the Askew Codex, and in the "Two Books of Ieou" of the Bruce Codex. In some passages, the Disciples are instructed to join hands around the Master during certain prayers and invocations of the Father, who is called the "Father of all Fatherhood, Boundless Light," similar to how the Father is praised as Light in our opening doxology. The "Second Book of Ieou" ends with a long praise-giving in the inner spaces; these mystical texts involve the Master teaching the Disciples out of the body. This praise-giving starts as follows (Carl Schmidt, Gnost. Schrift. . . . aus d. Codex Brucianus--Leipzig, 1892--pp. 187 ff.): "And He spoke to the Twelve: Surround Me, all of you!"They all gathered around Him. He said to them: Answer Me with "Amen" and sing praise with Me; then I will praise My Father for all the Treasures He has given. He began to sing a hymn, praising His Father, and said: "I praise You...; for You have drawn Yourself into Truth, creating the space of this Little Idea [the Cosmos]; yet You have not withdrawn Yourself. What is Your Will, O Unapproachable God?" He then made His Disciples say "Amen" three times.

From recent research, "Amen" is believed by scholars to be a purely Hebrew word. It originally meant "stability," "firmness," or "certainty" and later became an interjection used in conversation and for solemn affirmations, like in oaths and temple rituals. The Portuguese pronounce it as Âmên (with vowels as in Italian), and the Greek transliteration is Amên. In Revelation 3:14, Christ is called the Amen: "These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true Witness." It is said that in the great synagogue at Alexandria, after the reader's doxology, the congregation responded with Amen upon a signal from the attendant waving a flag. This practice was adopted by Christian churches, with Jerome noting that "the Amen re-echoes like celestial thunder." Hebrew and Aramaic are rich in loan-words from other languages, but I have never seen it suggested that Amen might be one. With respect to Hebraist specialists, I propose this idea, as Plutarch writes in his treatise On Isis and Osiris (ix).Moreover, while most people believe that the Egyptians called Zeus by the name Amoun (which we slightly modify to Ammôn), Manethô, the Sebennyte, interprets this name as "His hidden one," suggesting that the word itself implies the power of hiding. Hecatæus of Abdera, on the other hand, explains that Egyptians use this word when calling someone, as its sound conveys the idea of summoning.

Therefore, when Egyptians call upon their primary, hidden deity, whom they believe is universal, they say "Amoun!" This name, often transliterated directly from hieroglyphics as Amen, was considered a powerful word in Egyptian theurgy. We shouldn't think that Hecataeus implied Egyptians casually called each other "Amen" in the streets; rather, it was used as a magical word to summon a person's spiritual essence or as a supreme invocation to the unseen deity. This is similar to the use of the "Word of Glory" (Pranava), Om or Aum, in India today.

Sacred dancing was common in all significant mystery ceremonies. To illustrate this, we can refer to Philo of Alexandria's description, from the first quarter of our era, of the sacred dances performed by the Therapeuts or "Servants of God." Philo writes: "Then the leader stands and chants a hymn in honor of God, either a new composition or an ancient one by past poets. These poets have left behind numerous hymns and tunes in various forms, such as trimetric epics, processional hymns, libation-odes, altar-chants, stationary choruses, and dance-songs, all meticulously arranged in diverse musical patterns."After him, the others also, in groups and proper order, start the chanting while the rest listen in deep silence, except when they have to join in the chorus and refrains. Everyone, both men and women, participate.

After the banquet, they keep the holy all-night festival as follows:

They all stand up together, and about halfway through, they first separate into two groups, men in one and women in the other. A leader is chosen for each group, based on their reputation and suitability.

They then sing hymns in God's honor, using various meters and melodies. Sometimes they sing in chorus, sometimes one group keeps time while the other responds. They dance to the music, sometimes leading it, switching between processional hymns and standing songs, turning and returning in the dance.

After each group has sung and danced separately, drinking a God-pleasing nectar (just like in Bacchic rites where men drink unmixed wine), they come together to form one combined chorus.

The chorus of men and women Therapeuts, through melodies and harmony—women’s high notes complementing men’s deep tones—creates a harmonious and musical symphony. The ideas and expressions are beautiful, and the dancers are reverent, all aiming for piety.

Thus, filled with this beautiful intoxication until morning light, with no hangover or drowsiness, but with eyes and bodies fresher than when they arrived, they stand at dawn. Catching sight of the rising sun, they raise their hands to heaven, praying for sunlight, truth, and clarity of spiritual vision.Let's now examine the text of our hymn, which delves into a deeper mystery, starting with the introductory words from the Acts. The term "lawless Jews" refers to those under the influence of the "lawless Serpent"; in other words, those governed by physical birth as opposed to spiritual rebirth, or the Lesser Mysteries versus the Greater Mysteries. As the pre-Christian Greek editor of the Naassene Document puts it: "For He [the Great Man, the Logos, the Serpent of Wisdom] is Ocean—'giving birth to gods and men'—constantly flowing and ebbing." An early Jewish commentator adds: "When Ocean flows down, it gives birth to men; when it flows up, it gives birth to gods." He further explains: "This is the Great Jordan, which, when flowing downward, prevented the Sons of Israel from leaving Egypt or the Lower World, but was turned upward by Jesus [LXX for Joshua]."

This Serpent can be either a Good Spirit or an Evil Spirit, depending on a person's will. The regenerated or perfect person, one who is repentant and aligned with the Divine Will, turns the waters of Ocean upward, thus giving birth to himself as a god. The hymn's doxology is triadic—Father, Son, Mother. Charis, or Grace, represents Wisdom, God's Good-Will, the Holy Spirit, or Great Breath; essentially, the Power and Spouse of Deity. The order of the triple praise then reverses: Mother, Son, Father; for Glory is the Great Presence, the Father.Finally, there is a unity within the trinity, with praise given to the Father as Light, similar to the common invocation in Coptic Gnostic works: "Father of all Fatherhood, Boundless Light!" After the doxology, we encounter a series of contrasting statements. I believe these statements were not originally meant to be spoken by one person. Instead, they seem to be part of a dialogue. They were not addressed to the Disciples but were intended for a specific person. This suggests we are looking at the remnants of a mystery ritual involving two people: the Master (the Initiator) and the person being initiated.

The ultimate goal of Gnosis was the union of the human soul with the Divine Soul. In the Wisdom myth, the human soul is seen as the "lost sheep," the suffering Sophia who fell into the material world and was saved by Christ, her true Lord and Spouse. In the Great Descent, the Gnostics made remarkable efforts to understand how the Cosmos was created by the Logos, the Supernal Christ. This process was called "enformation according to substance," with the "substance" being Sophia in her isolation from the Plêrôma, the Fullness of Divine Being.

In the Great Ascent or Return, Gnosis sought to unveil the mysteries of salvation, or the rescue of the separated human soul and its return to the Divine. This was called "enformation according to gnosis," meaning self-awareness.The dialogue is carried out by those enacting the mystery of Sophia and Christ; however, we should remember that they are essentially the same Person, representing the lower and higher self in the presence of the Great Self. The twelve disciples symbolize the powers of the Master, sent forth (apostles) into the outer worlds, corresponding with the Great Twelve of the Presence, the Twelve Above; and they move in harmony with the cosmic motions of the Twelve, just as the candidate or neophyte, the Sophia below, moves in harmony with the cosmic motion of Charis or Grace or Sophia Above. If this rite is properly completed, the Presence that envelops the participants is Divine. This Presence is that of the Father Himself, who has no human form, but can be thought of as a "Heart" or "Head," a "Face," a Shekinah or Glory.

The seers of Gnosis envisioned this marvel of the Godhead, as hinted at in these excerpts from the "Untitled Apocalypse" of the Bruce Codex (F.F.F., p. 548):

"The Outline of His Face is beyond all knowing in the Outer Worlds—those Worlds that constantly seek His Face, desiring to know it; for His Word has entered them, and they long to see Him.

"The Light of His Eyes reaches the Spaces of the Outer Plêrôma; and the Word from His Mouth penetrates both Above and Below.

"The Hairs of His Head represent the number of the Hidden Worlds, and the Outline of His Face symbolizes the Æons [i.e., Perfect Spheres and Eternities].

"The Hair of His Face represents the number of the Outer Worlds, and the Outstretching of His Hands signifies the manifestation of the Cross.

"The Source of the Cross is the Man [Logos] whom no one can fully understand.

"He is the Father; He is the Source from which Silence [the Mother of the Æons] springs."Regarding the completion of atonement and the state of someone who joyfully surrenders to the divine powers, "and thus becoming powers, he is in God," as Poemandrês teaches, some insight can be drawn from the same text describing the Host of Powers, "having wreaths (or crowns) on their heads"—referring to Æons or Christs or Masters who have crowned their Twelve Powers and other spiritual energies (F.F.F., p. 556):

"Their Crowns emit Rays. The brilliance of Their Bodies reflects the Life of the Space they have entered.
"The Word (Logos) from Their Mouths is Eternal Life; the Light from Their Eyes provides Them Rest.
"The Movement of Their Hands represents Their Journey back to the Space they originated from; gazing at Their own Faces brings Self-Knowledge.
"Their Return to Themselves is a constant repetition; stretching out Their Hands confirms Them.
"The Hearing through Their Ears is Perception in Their Heart; the Unity of Their Limbs signifies the gathering of Israel.
"Their Unity with one another strengthens Them in the Logos."

While this may seem like "foolishness" to many, it is Light, Life, and Wisdom to a few who strive to become the Many in One and One in Many. Now, let's move on to the somewhat smaller mysteries of our ritual. I believe all terms must be interpreted as mystery-words; for the Gnostics, they held a wealth of meaning that varied for each person based on their understanding and experience. If I offer any suggestions for meaning, please consider them tentative and temporary, like rough notes in pencil in the margin that can be erased and changed according to one's knowledge and preference.

"I want to be saved." The human soul is "wandering in the labyrinth of ills," as the Naassene Hymn says (T.G.H., i.).The soul is being tossed around by the "fierce flood" of Ignorance, as described by the Preacher in one of the Trismegistic sermons. The soul is caught in the Ocean of Genesis and the Spheres of Fate, praying for safety and stability. This stability is achieved when the swirling worlds in the Great Whirlpool are transcended through unity with the Great Stability, the Logos—"He who stands, has stood, and will stand," as referred to in the Simonian Great Announcement. Initially, this safety represents neither motion nor stability but a cessation of agitation; the mind is no longer caught in the movement of Fate.

The tormented self cries out to escape the swirl, while another part of the self, not in the swirl, wants to enter it. The lower self, influenced by "downward" elements, must unite with the "upward" higher self to be saved from the swirling passions. Conversely, the higher self must connect with the lower self to be freed from the inability to express itself. "I would be loosed," meaning freed from the bonds of Fate and Genesis. In some rituals, the candidate was bound with a rope, symbolizing a serpent, representing the passions. "I would be wounded" or "I would be pierced" signifies the higher self's ray entering the heart to untie the "knot in the heart," allowing the lower self to receive the divine light of the higher self. This interpretation is supported by an alternative reading from a Latin translation, suggesting, "I would be dissolved," or "consumed by love."We continue to explore the mysteries of the "Sacred Marriage" or "Spiritual Union." "I would be begotten." This refers to the Mystery of the Immaculate Conception, or self-birth. "I would be begotten" as a Christ, the New Man, or True Man, who is self-begotten. "I would eat." By "eating," the food and the eater become one. The Logos is called the "Bread of Life," an essential part of the Eucharist. The soul desires to "eat" the Life in everything, meaning it must become everything to experience cosmic consciousness and be nourished by Life. Men can become part of the Cosmos through right action. To achieve this, we must stop living for ourselves and allow our own self-will to be "eaten" away. Then, our life becomes part of the Great Records, and we become a Living Oracle or Drama, a Christ. All life gains meaning, but this only happens when we surrender our self-will and unite with the Great Will. This "eating" signifies a deep union, where a man's life becomes part of a Greater Life. "I would hear." Notice there is no "I would see." This implies the candidate is already "seeing" and has reached an advanced stage. "Hearing" is more cosmic or greater than seeing, as we learn later in the Vision of the Cross, where John "sees the Lord Himself above the Cross, not having any shape, but only a voice."In hearing, the listener comes closer to the fundamental sound or breath (Âtman) that creates everything visible. To see, there must be form, even if it is just an idea. Hearing can be considered the action when power is given to someone, while seeing is the action after receiving that power. "I would understand" suggests stability, and Plato associates this understanding with the Sphere of Sameness, echoing ideas from Egypt. This stability of the true mind allows consciousness to connect events in the cycles of Fate to greater realities, revealing deeper truths in phenomena. The final part is likely an addition by a knowledgeable scribe.

The Logos represents true understanding or mind (Nous). "I would be washed" means to be baptized or immersed in the Ocean of Living Water, symbolizing the Great Oneness. This could also imply purification. Full baptism involved complete immersion, not just sprinkling, as described by Hermes in "The Cup" or "The Monad": "He filled a Mighty Cup with Mind and sent it down, commanding a Herald to proclaim to human hearts: 'Baptize yourself with this Cup's baptism. If your heart can, you can ascend to Him Who sent the Cup, knowing your purpose in life!' Those who understood and immersed themselves in Mind shared in Gnosis and became 'perfect men.' The Cup represents a substantial Presence. 'Grace leads the dance.'" The text may suggest this as a note rather than an Initiator's statement.The ceremony evolves. Previously, there was a circle dance, where participants moved in a ring, enclosing a mystery play, and chanted a sacred word. Now, a mystical connection is established with the Great Sphere, Charis or Sophia, the counterpart or partner of the Supernal Christ. She "leads the dance," meaning the participants start to act according to cosmic movements. In the Naassene Document, it is mentioned: "The Phrygians say that what originates from Him is the Piper." The Piper plays the seven-reeded Pan-pipe, creating the music of the spheres. An early Jewish commentator explains that "what is generated is Spirit in harmony," meaning Spirit, or Sophia the Holy Breath, is harmony. The Harmony refers to the Seven Spheres encircled by the Eighth. Interestingly, later in our fragment, the Logos is called "Wisdom in harmony."

The Greek word for "dance" in the phrase "dance ye all" differs from that in "leadeth the dance," reminiscent of the "orchestra" in Greek theatre. Greek drama likely originated from the Mysteries. However, it's generally believed it evolved from choral dances around Dionysus's altar, influencing the circular design of the Greek theatre, the orchestra. The dance symbolizes the world's mystery and human mystery—joy and sorrow, celebration and mourning. This idea aligns with the Gospel saying: "We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have played a dirge unto you, and ye have not lamented."Is it possible that there was a hidden version of a scripture where this saying was in the first person? In my analysis of the Naassene Document, I found evidence suggesting that the Christian commentator, through his comparisons with the Fourth Gospel, raises the question of whether he had access to the sources of that "Johannine" document. I believe that for the Gnostics, there was a deeper meaning, which is expressed in this Hymn, though still in a mystical way.

The higher group of joy, as the Gnostic Marcus would say, should merge with the lower group of sorrow to form an octave. This combination elevates a person from insignificance to greatness, allowing them to resonate with cosmic music. What was originally a note ("The one Eight," etc.) was mistakenly attributed to the Initiator by an uninformed scribe, with an Amen added. The Ogdoad or Eight (the full Octave in music) "sounds with us," meaning we are starting to dance to the Music of the Spheres.

As a result, the initiated soul begins to resonate with the ordered motions of the cosmos. The Higher Twelve, the powers beyond the individual soul, now lead this cosmic dance. More daringly, it suggests that at this stage of the rite, there was a presence of Masterhood. This implies that the aspirant, as described in the Trismegistic "Secret Sermon on the Mount" (which could be called "The Initiation of Tat"), transcends their self to achieve greater things.His "twelve disciples" start to dance around him or beyond him. These disciples or apostles of a new Christ are not earthly teachings, but powers radiating from the true Person into even greater realms. The apostles who venture into the world of men are reflections of the Great Powers that now emanate from the true Person, connecting him to the vast Cosmos. The phrase "all whose nature is to dance doth dance" is unclear due to a faulty text, making its exact meaning uncertain. If this interpretation is correct, "all" likely refers to the cosmic order, indicating that everything is prepared and spiritual communication is established between the earthly church and the heavenly Church Above, identified as the Supernal Sophia. "Who danceth not, knows not what is being done." This means that the soul must actively participate in the cosmic dance to achieve true knowledge or Gnosis. Understanding the Great World requires abandoning self-will and acting in harmony with the Great Events. This mirrors the teachings in the Fourth Gospel (John 7:17 and 9:31): "If a man desires to do God's Will, he will understand the Doctrine"; and "If a man worships God and does His Will, God will hear him." God's Will is embodied in His Divine Spouse, Sophia or Wisdom, through whom He created the worlds. "I would flee." This could mean that the newly born soul is afraid, overwhelmed by the powerful new emotions. It might also indicate the need for balance; the soul feels drawn into the infinite but is stabilized by the greater power of the Master, representing the opposing forces of centrifugal and centripetal powers. "I would be adorned."The original Greek term suggests being "rightly ordered" (kosmein). It can also mean "clothed in appropriate garments." Essentially, the soul prays for its small, disordered cosmos to be aligned with the Great Order, so it may be adorned in "robes of glory" or "power" like the Great Glories of the Heavenly Spheres. "I would be at one." This marks the mystery of union, where the soul joyfully lets go of its separateness and frees itself from the limitations of "possession"—what is "mine" as separate from the rest. Thus, we have the triple declaration of the loss of "dwelling," "place," and "temple" (the very "shrine" of the soul) and the assurance of gaining all "dwellings," "places," and "temples." 

To illustrate this sublime idea, we can quote from the "Untitled Apocalypse" of the Bruce Codex (F.F.F., p. 554):

"Holy, Holy, Holy is He, the [seven vowels each repeated three times]

That is to say:
"Thou art the Living One among the living.
"Thou art the Holy One among the holy.
"Thou art Being among beings.
"Thou art Father among Fathers.
"Thou art God among gods.
"Thou art Lord among lords.
"Thou art Space among spaces."

They praise Him, saying:
"Thou art the House;
"And Thou art the Dweller in the House."

They also praise the Son hidden in Him:
"Thou art; Thou art the Alone-begotten—Light, Life, and Grace."

"The Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head"—because He possesses all "places." Then come the comforting words that Christ, the Logos, is the Lamp, the Mirror, the Door, and the Way for the human soul; the Divine Soul is everything for the beloved. In worlds of darkness and uncertainty, Christ is the Lamp we must follow, as He leads us along the Way. For those who can perceive the Christ-essence in all, this Christ-essence is a Mirror reflecting the great truths of the higher worlds.There is only one way to pass through the Wall of Separation between the Higher and the Lower, and that is through Christ the Mediator. He is the Door, as Thrice-greatest Hermes calls the Mind the "Inner Door" (T.G.H., iii. 274). Parmenides also refers to this mystery in his "Truthwards" when he describes the Gates between Day and Night, or Light and Darkness. For anyone who truly seeks this Door, meaning who focuses all their attention and effort in this direction, the Great Wall or Limit will disappear, and they will be able to go freely.

Christ the Logos is the Way. He is our path to God, both in the light and in the material world; either as a guiding Light, a point of focus for the pure mind, or a Path to walk on. In any case, Christ leads us to God. The ceremony changes with the words: "Now answer to My dancing." At this point, everything can be seen as occurring within the Master’s presence. Union of substance has been achieved, but not yet union of consciousness. Before this final mystery can be completed, the knowledge of the Passion of Man, which is the Great Passion or continuous experience of the Great Act, must be understood. The soul is to view the mystery as its own Passion. The perfected soul can view the mystery in peace; however, the soul of the aspirant is not yet perfected in knowledge, but only in substance, so it may feel the Great Passion within itself, yet as separate from itself.

At this point in the lower ritual, the mystery-drama, the Passion of Man, must have been shown. What exactly it was is difficult to guess; it must have been something very distressing, as the neophyte is completely shaken or unnerved. He did not have the strength of perfect faith in the Power of the Master, perhaps because he saw the Master dismembered before his eyes, or transforming from one into many, or being killed in some way.After the Passion-drama or Passion-vision comes the teaching; because in such rites—such intense experiences for the sake of understanding—there must be an emotional experience before there can be true knowledge. This knowledge is given by the Master Himself, the divine essence within man: Therefore, the lover must first see the Beloved in suffering. And then come the comforting words: "I am a resting place; rest on Me." For the Suffering Christ is simply the manifestation in time and space of the Triumphant Eternal Christ, the Æon.

Here, the mystery of Docetism, and what the Vedânta calls Mâyâ, gains philosophical meaning. This mystery is hinted at in many teachings; but here I will quote from the Trismegistic sermon called "The Inner Door" (T.G.H., iii. 275): "And living with this mindset and ordering his life accordingly, he will see the Son of God becoming everything for holy souls, so that He may lead the soul out of the realm of Fate into the Incorporeal. For having power in all, He becomes all things, whatever He wills; and following the Father's command, He penetrates through the whole Body, pouring His Light into the mind of every soul. He brings it back to the Blessed Region, where it was before it became physical—following Him and being led by Him into the Light."

"You will know who I am when I leave." These and the next two sentences seem to suggest—if we dare to believe there was a true vision of an inner mystery accompanying the outer drama—an idea like this. The substantial nature of the Presence, the Body, so to speak, of atmosphere, which may have been seen—with some hint of a human form as its "pillar" or "support," and simultaneously a sphere or completeness holding it together—this, says the Master, is not my true Self.I am not the Mirror of the World, nor am I the Word or Living Symbol that encompasses and gives meaning to the entire world. You will understand the true nature of Christ when you become him. "If you had known how to suffer." These sentences are perhaps the most meaningful in this remarkable ritual. In one sense (among many), it suggests: If your body truly understood how to dance and could perfectly align with My Passion (the manifestation of real life and consciousness), you would have been able to stay centered and not be pulled back into suffering or disharmony; you wouldn’t have been overwhelmed by the drama of life. "That which you do not know, I will teach you." The soul, on its own, cannot understand certain things; the Master will teach these. This implies that this Power or Presence connects your "body" or atmosphere to the realities of Greater Things. As soon as the sphere-"body" (the psychic envelope of a normal person, usually imperfect) is capable of dancing, the Master's Power will give it meaning. The small self cannot achieve this. The Power is connected to greater realms and comes naturally from the perfect harmony of all man's "bodies." "I am your God, not the Betrayer's." In connection with the introduction before our Hymn, this might remind readers of Judas. But the Gnostics had a broader perspective. The Betrayer is more like the lawless Serpent, the Kakodaimôn, which hands the soul over to the bodies of death—a mystery not addressed in our ritual. "I would be kept in time with holy souls." This sentence seems out of place to me.One interpretation is that as the soul observes the Dance, it prays to be in harmony with "Holy Souls," aiming for its consciousness and form to unite perfectly. This would transform the little soul into a Great Soul or Master, a Perfect or Balanced Soul. The final sentences seem to come from two different sources of the original text, indicating that there were several versions of this ritual, which were well-known and used in Gnostic circles. Initially, it must have been kept very secret, for later in the text, we read the Master's instruction to John: "That Passion which I showed you and the others in the Dance, I want it to be called a mystery." 

Could it be that in the original form, John, the Beloved, was the candidate? Perhaps, but even if it were so, "John" wouldn't be seen by a Gnostic as just one historical figure. There had been, there are, and there will be many Johns. From the Twelve, there are Three; and from the Three, there is One. Just as Peter, James, and John were closest to the Lord during His significant moments, the Johannine tradition also shows that John was the closest during His great acts.

Moreover, in the Trismegistic tradition, among the three disciples—Ammon, Asclepius, and Tat—Tat, the most spiritual disciple, succeeds his "Father," Thrice-greatest Hermes, when He ascends to the Gods. Similarly, in the Johannine tradition, John succeeds Jesus when He ascends to the Father of all "Fathers." "Father" was the title for the Master, or Initiator, and the Head of the community.In a manuscript of the Fourth Gospel, kept in the archives of the Templars of St. John of Jerusalem in Paris—likely originating from those who encountered the Johannine tradition in the East—we find additions not present in the commonly accepted text. According to Thilo (Code. Apoc. N.T., p. 880), the additions are as follows:

To John 17:26: "Amen, I say to you, I am not of this world; but John shall be your Father until he joins Me in Paradise. And He anointed them with the Holy Spirit."

To John 19:26-30: "He said to His Mother: Do not weep; I go to My Father and to Eternal Life. Behold your Son. He will take My place. Then He said to the Disciple: Behold your Mother! Then, bowing His head, He released His Spirit."

If it is intended that what "I showed you in the Dance" be considered a mystery, then it must remain a mystery. I present my guesses with humility, not expecting them to be seen as worthy offerings by many who serve in this sacred space. However, I hope I have at least suggested that the Hymn of Jesus is not a hymn but an early Christian mystery ritual, possibly the oldest Christian ritual we have.

#### Corpus Hermeticum I: Poemandres, the Shepherd of Men

1. Once, when my mind was contemplating existence, my thoughts soared high while my physical senses were subdued, akin to the state of deep sleep after a meal or physical exhaustion. A being of immense size and beyond comprehension called my name and asked: "What do you wish to hear and see, and what do you seek to learn and understand?"

2. I responded: "Who are you?" He replied: "I am the Shepherd of Men, the Mind of all masterhood; I know your desires and I am always with you."

3. I said: "I want to learn about existence, understand its nature, and know God. This is what I wish to hear." He answered: "Keep in mind all you wish to know, and I will teach you."

4. As he spoke, his appearance changed, and in an instant, everything was revealed to me. I saw a limitless vision, everything transformed into a sweet, joyous light. I was entranced as I watched. Soon, darkness began to descend on part of it, terrifying and gloomy, twisting like a snake.Then the Darkness transformed into a kind of Moist Nature, chaotic and indescribable, emitting smoke like a fire and producing an eerie, indescribable sound. After that, an inarticulate cry emerged from it, as if it were the Voice of Fire. 

From the Light, a Holy Word (Logos) descended upon that Nature. Then, pure Fire leaped upwards from the Moist Nature; it was light, swift, and active. The light Air followed the Fire; rising from the Earth-and-Water towards the Fire, it seemed to hang from it. However, Earth and Water remained so mixed that they were indistinguishable from each other. Yet, they moved because of the Spirit-Word (Logos) within them.

Then Man-Shepherd said to me: Do you understand what this Vision means? No, I replied. He said: I am that Light, your God, Mind, existing before the Moist Nature that appeared from Darkness; the Light-Word (Logos) that appeared from Mind is the Son of God.

What does this mean? I asked. Know that what sees and hears within you is the Lord's Word (Logos); but Mind is Father-God. They are not separate; their union is Life itself. Thank you, I said. Understand the Light, He answered, and become friends with it.

As He spoke, He gazed into my eyes for a long time, making me tremble. When He raised His head, I saw in my Mind the Light, now in countless Powers, and the Cosmos grown beyond all limits, with the Fire surrounded and subdued by a mighty Power. When I saw these things, I understood because of Man-Shepherd's Word (Logos).

As I stood in great astonishment, He said to me again: You beheld in your Mind the Archetypal Form whose existence is eternal, without beginning or end.Man-Shepherd spoke to me, and I asked: Where do Nature's elements come from? He replied: From the Will of God.

Nature received the Word (Logos) and, inspired by the Beautiful Cosmos, replicated it, creating her own cosmos using her elements and the birth of souls. God-the-Mind, being both male and female, as Light and Life, created another Mind to give form to things. This new Mind, a god of Fire and Spirit, formed Seven Rulers who govern the cosmos that we perceive. People call their rule Fate.

Immediately, God's Reason (Logos) ascended from the lower elements to Nature's pure formation and united with the Formative Mind, as they were of the same essence. Thus, Nature's lower elements were left without reason, becoming pure matter. The Formative Mind, united with Reason, surrounded the spheres and set them in motion, letting them turn endlessly. For the circulation of these spheres starts and ends as Mind wills. Nature then brought forth life from the lower elements, leaving them without Reason (Logos). The Air produced winged creatures, the Water created swimming beings, and Earth-and-Water, separated by the Mind’s will, brought forth all kinds of creatures: four-footed animals, reptiles, and both wild and tame beasts. 

The All-Father Mind, being Life and Light, created Man equal to Himself and fell in love with him as His own child because Man was extraordinarily beautiful, the Image of his Creator. In truth, God loved His own Form and bestowed upon Man all of His creations.And when he saw what the Creator had made in the Father, Man also wanted to create. Permission was granted by the Father.

Changing his state to the creative realm, where he would have full authority, he looked at his Brother's creations. They fell in love with him and each gave him a part of their own order.

After he understood their essence and became part of their nature, he wanted to break through their boundaries and conquer the force pressing on the Fire.

So, he who had authority over all mortals and irrational lives in the cosmos bent down through the Harmony, breaking through its strength, and showed Nature God's beautiful Form. When she saw this eternal beauty, and the one who had all the energies of the seven Rulers and God's Form, she smiled with love. It was like seeing the image of Man's finest form on her Water, his shadow on her Earth.

Seeing a form like his own in her Water, he loved it and wanted to live in it. His will became action, and he brought the mindless form to life. Nature embraced him completely, and they became intertwined as lovers.

This is why man, above all creatures on earth, is dual: mortal because of the body, but immortal because of the essential Man. Though he is deathless and has control over all, he suffers like a mortal, subject to Fate. Thus, above the Harmony, he has become a slave within it. Though male-female from a male-female Father, and sleepless from a sleepless Sire, he is still overcome by sleep.Here is the simplified and modernized version of the text:

---

"Teach me, Mind, for I am eager to learn the Word (Logos)," I said. The Shepherd replied, "This is a mystery hidden until now."

Nature, embraced by Man, produced a great wonder. Since Man had the nature of the Seven, made of Fire and Spirit, Nature quickly created seven "men," matching the natures of the Seven, both male and female, and moving in the air.

"O Shepherd," I said, "I am filled with great desire to hear more; please do not leave."

The Shepherd said, "Be silent, for I have not yet begun the first discourse (logos)." "I am silent," I replied.

The generation of these seven happened as I have described. Earth acted as a woman, and her Water was filled with longing. She took ripeness from Fire and spirit from Aether. Nature then created forms suitable for Man. Man transformed from Life and Light into soul and mind—Life into soul, and Light into mind. This continued throughout the world's parts until their end and new beginnings.

"Now listen to the rest of the discourse you long to hear. When the period ended, the bond holding everything together was loosened by God's Will. All animals, being male and female, were separated along with man; some became partly male, others partly female. Immediately, God spoke through His Holy Word (Logos):

'Increase and multiply, all creatures and creations. And man, who has Mind, should learn that he is immortal and that the cause of death is love, though Love is everything.'

When He said this, His Forethought, through Fate and Harmony, arranged their couplings and generations. Thus, everything multiplied according to its kind."

---And he who has learned to know himself has reached a higher good that surpasses abundance. But he who, through misguided love, focuses his love on his body--

[p. 13]

stays in darkness, wandering and suffering through his senses, experiencing things of death. 

20. What is the great mistake, I asked, that the ignorant commit which causes them to be deprived of immortality? 

You seem, he said, not to have paid attention to what you heard. Did I not tell you to think? 

Yes, I do think, and I remember, and therefore thank you. 

If you thought about it, he said, tell me: Why do those who are in death deserve death? 

It is because the dark gloom is the root and base of the physical body; from it came the moist nature; from this, the body in the material world was formed; and from this body, death drains the water.

21. Your thought was correct. But how does "he who knows himself go to Him," as God's Word (Logos) has declared? 

I replied: The Father of all things consists of Light and Life, and from Him, Man was born. 

You speak well, he said. Light and Life is Father-God, and from Him, Man was born. If you learn that you are of Life and Light, and that you are only temporarily separated from them, you shall return to Life. Thus spoke the Man-Shepherd. 

But tell me further, I cried, how shall I come to Life again? For God says: "The man who has Mind in him, let him learn to know that he himself is deathless."

22. Have not all men then Mind? 

You speak well, he said. I, Mind, am present with holy and good men, the pure and merciful, those who live piously. To such, my presence becomes an aid, and they immediately gain knowledge of all things, win the Father's love by their pure lives, thank Him, invoke His blessings, and chant hymns, focusing on Him with ardent love.Before they allow the body to die naturally, people often turn away in disgust from its sensations and the understanding of how it functions. But it is I, the Mind, that prevents these bodily operations from reaching their natural end. As the gatekeeper, I shut off all entrances and block the mental actions that base and evil energies try to induce.

For those who are mindless, wicked, depraved, envious, covetous, murderous, and who love impiety, I stay far away. Instead, I yield my place to the Avenging Spirit, who intensifies their torment with fire, attacking them through their senses and making them more prone to breaking the law, leading to greater suffering. These individuals are endlessly driven by insatiable desires, constantly striving in darkness.

You have taught me well, as I wished, O Mind. Now, please tell me more about the nature of the Way Above as it applies to me now.

The Man-Shepherd replied: When your physical body is to be dissolved, you first surrender the body itself to the process of change, and thus your former form disappears. You then surrender your way of life, now devoid of energy, to the Spirit. The body's senses return to their sources, becoming separate energies, while passion and desire withdraw to a nature void of reason. This is how a person ascends through the Harmony after death.To the first zone, he assigns the Energy of Growth and Decline; to the second zone, the Device of Evils now rendered powerless; to the third, the Deception of Desires now powerless; to the fourth, his Overbearing Arrogance, also rendered powerless; to the fifth, unholy Daring and Recklessness, rendered powerless; to the sixth, the Pursuit of Wealth by evil means, stripped of its power; and to the seventh zone, Entrapping Falsehood, rendered powerless.

And then, with all the energies of the Harmony stripped from him, clothed in his true Power, he reaches the Nature of the Eighth zone, where he joins those who sing hymns to the Father. Those there joyfully welcome his arrival; and he, now like those residing there, hears the Powers above the Eighth zone singing praises to God in their own language. Then they, as a group, return to the Father; they willingly surrender themselves to the Powers, and by doing so, they become Powers themselves in God. This is the ultimate end for those who have gained Gnosis—to be united with God. Why should you delay any longer? Since you have received everything, you must guide the worthy, so that through you, humanity may be saved by your God.

When He finished speaking, the Man-Shepherd joined the Powers.

But I, with thanks and blessings to the Father of the universal Powers, was freed, filled with the power He had given me and the knowledge He had shared about the nature of the universe and the highest Vision. I began to preach to people about the Beauty of Devotion and Gnosis:

O people, earth-born folk, you who have given yourselves to drunkenness, sleep, and ignorance of God, be sober now, cease your excesses, and stop being enchanted by irrational sleep!

And when they heard, they came together in agreement.Here is the text converted into modern English, simplified, and corrected for clarity without altering its original meaning:

---

I say to you:

People of the earth, why have you surrendered yourselves to Death when you have the power to achieve Immortality? Repent, those of you who walk hand in hand with Error and share your lives with Ignorance; leave the darkness and embrace Immortality, abandon Destruction!

Some mocked me and chose to follow the path of Death; others begged to be taught and threw themselves at my feet. I helped them up and became a guide, teaching them how they could be saved. I shared words of wisdom with them and gave them the Water of Immortality to drink.

When evening came and the sun began to set, I asked them all to give thanks to God. After they finished giving thanks, each person returned to their own rest. I kept in my heart the kindness of the Divine Shepherd and felt more than joy with my hopes fulfilled. For the sleep of the body became the awakening of the soul, closing my eyes brought true vision, silence brought goodness, and speaking brought forth good things. This all happened because of my Mind, the Divine Shepherd, the Word of all mastery. Inspired by God, I reached the Plain of Truth. Therefore, with all my soul and strength, I give thanks to the Father-God.

Holy are You, O God, the Father of all. Holy are You, O God, whose will is perfected through Your own powers. Holy are You, O God, who desires to be known and is known by Your own. Holy are You, who created all things by Your Word. Holy are You, of whom all nature is an image. Holy are You, whose form nature has never made. Holy are You, more powerful than all power. Holy are You, transcending all excellence.You are holy, greater than any praise.

Accept the pure offerings of my reason, from my soul and heart, always reaching up to You, O indescribable and unspeakable One, whose name only Silence can express. Listen to my prayer that I may never lack knowledge, which is the essence of our common being. Fill me with Your power and grace, so that I may bring light to those who are ignorant, my brothers, and Your children. For this reason, I believe and bear witness; I go towards Life and Light. Blessed are You, O Father. Your human would be holy as You are holy, just as You have given him Your full authority to be.The word "kosmos" (world-order) means either "order" or "world," and in the original text, there's often a play on these two meanings, similar to the word "logos."

1. Nature and God's Will are the same.
2. This refers to the ideal world-order in the realms of reality.
3. Likely referring to the Pure Air mentioned earlier.
4. This refers to the sensible or manifested world, our current universe, as opposed to the ideal eternal universe, which is the model for all universes.
5. This term refers to fate or destiny.
6. The Logos that previously descended into Nature.
7. "Omoousios" is usually translated as "consubstantial," but "oysia" means "essence" or "being" rather than "substance."
8. The Prototype, Cosmic, Ideal, or Perfect Man.
9. This can also mean Beauty ("morfeis").
10. Compare with The Gospel of Mary in the Akhmim Codex: "He nodded, and when He had thus nodded assent..."
11. The Eighth Sphere that bounds the Seven.
12. For a note on "exoysia," see R. in loc. and 48, note 3.
13. Refers to the Seven Spheres created by his Brother.
14. "Taxis" means rank or order.
15. Or "wear down." However, the reading "katanoeisai" might be more accurate; "he intended to understand" this Boundary or Ring Pass Not. See R. 49, note 1.
16. Refers to the Mighty Power mentioned earlier.
17. See Cyril, C. J., i. 33 (Frag. xiii.); R. 50: "beugt sich... nieder." Compare especially with Plato, Phaedrus, 249 C., where he talks about the soul "raising up her face (anakupsasa) to That which is." Also see Apion in Clement. Hom., vi. 4, in Comment. C. H., xi. (xii.)
18. Refers to the harmonious interplay, concord, or system of the spheres ruled by the Rulers, essentially the cosmos of Fate.
19. "Energeia" means energy and realization.
20. This means "asexual" but with the potential for both sexes.
21. For various suggestions to fill this gap, see R. in loc.; for Keil's suggestion, see R. 367.
22. As well as Nature.
23. Harmony.
24. See the section mentioned earlier.
25. "Metarsioys."Here is the simplified and modernized version of the text:

The term needs a clearer meaning than the vague "sublime" it is usually translated as. ^11:4 For Keil's completion of the gap, see R. 368. ^11:5 "me ektrexe" might mean to diverge from the subject or to go too fast; literally, it means "do not run away." ^12:1 This refers to parts of what Hermes elsewhere calls the "cosmic man." ^12:2 See C. H., xvi. 16. ^12:3 Omitting the "ta" before "onta." ^12:4 "pronoia," meaning Nature as Sophia, Providence, or Will. ^13:1 There is a word-play between "planes" and "planw'menos." ^13:2 Meaning Darkness. ^13:3 Meaning The Moist Nature. ^14:1 "eidotes aytun ta energe'mata." ^15:1 The text of this paragraph is very confused in the manuscripts. ^15:2 "peri teis anodoy teis ginomenes." ^15:3 "to Ethos," meaning the habitual part of man, presumably the way of life impressed by habit on the body; or it may mean "class" of life as in the Vision of Er. ^15:4 See C. H., x. (xi.) 16. ^15:5 "o thymos kai e epithymia,"--the masculine and feminine as positive and negative aspects of the "animal soul." ^16:1 "anenergeton." ^16:2 See C. H., xiii. (xiv.) 7. ^16:3 See C. H., xiii. (xiv.) 15. ^16:4 "taxei," meaning order or group, specifically of the Nine; the Father being the Ten, or consummation. ^17:1 See K. K., 25: "Thus speaking, God became Imperishable Mind." ^17:2 See the saying: "Jesus said, 'I stood in the midst of the world, and in the flesh I was seen by them, and I found all men drunken, and none thirsty, and my soul grieved over the sons of men, because they are blind in heart.'" Sayings of Our Lord from an Early Greek Papyrus, Grenfell & Hunt (London; 1897). ^18:1 See P. S. A., xii. 2. ^18:2 The Race of the Logos includes all who were conscious of the Logos in their hearts, who had repented and thus were "logoi." ^18:3 See Mark iv. 4: "He who sows, sows the Word (Logos)."

^18:4 See K. K., 1--the drink given by Isis to Horus. ^19:1 "neipsis," meaning soberness, watchfulness, lucidity. ^19:2 See section 2 above. ^19:3 See K. K. (Stob., Ec., i.).### Commentary on Vision and Apocalypse

The "Poemandres" treatise is one of the most important works in Trismegistic literature and serves as the foundational gospel for the Poemandres Communities. It is presented as a revelation or apocalypse received by the founder of this tradition. 

However, this founder is not a historical figure but a symbol of a teaching power or a level of spiritual enlightenment—someone who has attained the "Hermes" or "Thrice-Greatest" state of consciousness. This advanced stage of enlightenment involves an enhanced spiritual intuition that allows the mystic to experience a touch of cosmic consciousness and remember it upon returning to a normal state.

The teachings are naturally presented in an apocalyptic and logical format, as they claim to reveal the spiritual vision or "Epopteia" of the Inner Mysteries. This vision is disclosed by the Great Initiator or Master-Hierophant, the Mind of all mastery. Many seers and prophets of the time have indicated that this vision transcends the ordinary human consciousness and cannot be fully expressed in human language.Being a living and powerful reality beyond anything known to man, it deeply influenced him, making him see and understand things in a new way. This Vision was interpreted differently by each person because they had to express the pure Truth in their own terms, using their best thoughts, knowledge, and imagination. That's why there are so many different expressions and experiences among the mystics of that time. The experience itself was the same for all, but how they described it depended on their background.

It's rare to find a document that comes directly from a seer’s own experience without any additions. The Vision wasn’t about providing new facts or ideas; it illuminated existing traditions and showed them as parts of a whole. Once a person connected with this Great Synthesis, they would recall many scriptures, myths, cosmological fragments, and symbols that naturally fit together. These insights weren't owned by any specific writer; they were universal truths from the same divine source. Therefore, the literature produced was often anonymous or falsely attributed to someone else.First, there was a core of personal vision and direct insight. Then, similar material from various sources was grouped together for teaching purposes. These mystics and scripture writers did not intend for their work to be seen as permanently infallible; there were many revisions, additions, and changes. It was those without the sense of illumination who later claimed these texts were inerrantly dictated by God. The original authors, who wrote from personal experience, knew how their writings were created and understood the nature of their visions and hearings.

Therefore, we must treat these documents as human creations. While we analyze them closely as literary works—assembled, edited, and modified from various sources—we should remember that they were not crafted by tricksters but by sincere individuals. These people saw their work as a holy and spiritual task, believing they were guided in selecting and combining the best elements from other scriptures into a new, more enlightening whole suitable for their time.

The "Poemandres" treatise is an example of this. Although we do not have the original form, we have a version meant to be read as a single document. In our comments, we will try not to let the inconsistencies of its outer form diminish our appreciation of its inner spirit. At the same time, we will acknowledge that its current form has evolved from simpler beginnings.In deep meditation, the disciple achieves the pinnacle of his efforts and receives initiation from the Master of masters. This Master grants him the authority to teach and become a master or a Hermes.

It has been clearly shown in the Prolegomena that this Grand Master of the Inner Mysteries was both Man and Shepherd of men, representing the true essence of humanity. This is evidenced by the text, where the Great Man, a "Being more than vast," tells the little man that although he now recognizes his Greater Self for the first time, that Self has always been "everywhere with thee." This is beautifully illustrated by a passage from the Gospel of Eve, presumably an Egyptian gospel, which states:

"I stood on a high mountain and saw a gigantic Man and a dwarf. I heard a thunderous voice and approached to listen. He spoke to me and said: I am you, and you are me; wherever you may be, I am there. I am scattered in all places, and wherever you wish, you can gather Me; and in gathering Me, you gather Yourself."

THE PRESENCE

The disciple had met the conditions to see the Holy Sight by detaching himself from all lower desires. Unlike the theurgist in popular Hermes-invocations who prayed for wealth, fame, and happiness, the disciple's sole desire now is to "learn the things that are, understand their nature, and know God." He longs for Gnosis—knowledge of the Cosmos and its mysteries, knowledge of Nature, the Great Mother, and ultimately, knowledge of God, the Father of worlds. This single question occupies his mind, and his entire being is focused on this quest for understanding.It's important to note that the Gospel of Eve doesn't describe the seer standing apart from himself and seeing both his smaller and Greater Self at the same time. Instead, the seer is aware of a Presence, a Persona in the highest theological sense. This Presence isn't seen but felt, and communicates mind to mind. The seer hears this Presence rather than sees it.

**THE VISION OF CREATION**

1. The first part of his question is: How did this universe come into existence? The answer is the transformation of the Boundless Presence into "Light, sweet joyous Light." He loses all mental images of the cosmos and is immersed in the infinity of Limitless Light and Joy, which brings him to a state of highest ecstasy. However, he seeks Gnosis, not just Joy and Light, but Wisdom—the understanding and reconciliation of the great Opposites, the essence of all Manifestation. Therefore, he must understand the Mystery of Ignorance as well as that of Knowledge. Within the Infinite Light, the Shadow of the Unknown appears, which he perceives as Darkness—the Shadow of the Thrice-unknown Darkness, which, according to Damascius, was the First Principle of the Egyptians, the Ineffable Mystery, about which they "said nothing," and our author also remains silent on this.This darkness emerges from within the disciple's consciousness, spreading downward like a Great Snake, symbolizing the unknown mysteries of the cosmos's root matter. Its motion is spiral and chaotic, not yet confined or ordered, contrasting with the peaceful Light. It evolves from Dark Space or Spirit into Fluid Matter, which the Greek mystics might call Rhea, the Primal Mother of the future universe. It wails and groans, indicating its unharmonized state. In the Sophia myth, it represents the incomplete birth from the Sophia Above, brought forth alone and imperfect, crying out to the Father of All for perfection to transform it into an ordered world.

The Primal Chaotic Sound, from its initial darkness, gradually becomes less confused under the influence of Boundless Light, eventually symbolized by a "Cry" or "Voice of Fire," expressing a need for union with the Cosmic Word. The three primal stages are Darkness, Moist Essence, and Fire, representing the Pre-cosmic Elements.The same idea, though in different forms, can be found in a Gnostic system preserved by the Old Latin translator of Irenaeus and by Theodoret, who attributed it to the Sethians, also known as Ophianae or Ophitae. Seth was associated with Typhon or Darkness, and could be symbolized as the Great Serpent of Darkness, as in our text. Hence, the name "Those of the Serpent" was likely given to them by their theological opponents (orthodox Jews and Christians). In this system, the Primal Elements are Water, Darkness, Abyss, and Chaos. The Light was the Child of the supreme Trinity—the First Man, the Second Man, and the Holy Spirit or First Woman. This Light was later called the Cosmic Christ by Jewish and Christian traditions. The Fire of Desire or Cry of the Darkness was to be satisfied or quenched by the Light shaping its unformed substance into the cosmos. In another vision, preserved in a similar treatise, Hermes sees the cosmos in its finished beauty, full of Light and without any Fire.

THE DESCENT OF THE LOGOS

5. In response to this Cry for Light, a Holy Word, the Seed of the future Cosmos, is dropped into the Heart of the Dark-Moist-Fiery-Nature. This Word is perfect, timely, and ordering. The Cosmic Animal Nature is filled with the Light of the Supernal Reason, which permeates its entire being. This immediately organizes the Chaotic Elements into Pure Fire, Pure Air, and Pure Water-Earth. It is suggested that Nature saw the Word and all his Beauty in her Fire and Air, but only heard him in her Water-Earth.

6. The Shepherd explains that Light is really Mind, and Mind is God—God prior to Nature, but not prior to Darkness.The Unity of Light and Darkness is an even deeper mystery. Light and Mind represent the highest concept of God that a disciple can understand. The Light-Word, or the emanation of Supreme Reason, is the Son of God, the Son of the Great Mind.

THE REVELATION OF THE PLEROMA

Reitzenstein notes that the narrative seems interrupted by a second vision and resumes only at section 9. He believes this is an insertion of another creation story into the ongoing one. However, I think this pause in the main narrative is a necessary digression to introduce the previously unseen Greatnesses "within" the Veil of Light, which form the Economy of the Pleroma. The disciple needed to see more to understand what he had already seen. He must now unite with the Light, having previously seen only its reflection, the logos within him. The logos and Light (or Mind) are not separate; they are one. The Son is one with the Father in a state that goes beyond opposites. The Logos seems to come forth yet remains with the Father, and this duality constitutes its Life—essentially, it is an emanation. Hermes is instructed to understand Light as Life and to embrace it.

Previously, the Light was a oneness that the disciple's highest vision could not penetrate, a Veil of Light that hid the Beauties, Perfections, and Greatnesses of the Intelligible from his mind's eye. To pierce this veil, the Master had to give him an even greater power of sight. The small word or light-spark within the disciple is intensified by the Great Word of the Master, which is an Intelligible Utterance of the Mind, enhancing his being.He now sees and understands the countless Powers within the Light, which form the Ideal Blueprint of all worlds. Between the specific physical universe of his earlier vision and this Vastness was a Great Power or Boundary (Horos) that surrounded the elements of the physical universe and contained its Fire.

In amazement, he asks where these seemingly chaotic and wild elements of the new world come from, elements that need to be tamed and separated from the Harmony of the Perfect Powers. The answer is that Chaos also exists by God's Will. Both Discord and Harmony, Chaos and Order, come from God. The Primal Elements are like the Passions of God's Will desiring Himself. It's like God as Mother or Spouse desiring Himself as Father. 

In other writings of the Trismegistic texts, this "Feminine Aspect" of Deity is called Wisdom and Nature and Creation and Isis. He is Wisdom desiring Himself, that Desire being the Primal Cause as Mother of the whole world-process, which is completed by His Fullness uniting with His Desire or Wisdom, and thus perfecting it. This is the core message of the Gnostic Sophia myth, which I have strong reasons to believe mainly came from Egypt. Interestingly, Reitzenstein quotes the two chapters from Plutarch on which I base my conclusions, but he doesn't notice that in this respect the Christianized Gnosis clearly depends on Egypt. Philo also tells us that the Mother of All is Knowledge (episteme), the same name Plutarch gives to Isis. The Mother, when considered outside the Fullness, is impregnated by the Word, which Basilides would have called the All-seed Potency of the Fullness, endowed with all Powers, and sent forth as the seed of the physical universe that is to be.In her higher nature, the Mother contemplates the eternal order of the universe, while in her lower nature, she replicates its beauty through the permutations and combinations of her elements and the transformations of her lives or souls. Reitzenstein sees this form of cosmogenesis as pantheistic, although he believes the overall narrative has a dualistic tendency. He acknowledges that such contradictory ideas often appear in Gnostic systems of the same era but still emphasizes their differences, suggesting an interpolation.

Reitzenstein is further convinced by the fact that while section 9 describes God as male-female, the second vision presents a female deity beside the Highest God. However, these contradictions do not seem as significant to me as they do to Professor Reitzenstein. Even in the most monotheistic systems, dualism eventually appears; it is unavoidable due to the nature of things. The dualism in our text is not very pronounced. Although section 4 does not explicitly state it, it implies that Darkness comes from Light itself, as previously there was only Light, and "all things" appeared as Light to the seer. It reflects the mystery of the Serpent of Darkness wrapping itself around the lower parts of the Light.In my opinion, the seer is shown a deeper vision within the Light Veil to eliminate the idea of dualism. Here, concepts like monotheism, dualism, tritheism, polytheism, and pantheism blend together in a formless state. When describing this vision, we must use familiar language, but each word takes on a new meaning. Even angels cannot fully describe it; only the One who speaks the Words of the One Tongue can express it.

I don't know where this profound idea of the Pleroma originates. It seems impossible to trace it to a specific place, just as it is pointless to trace the origins of dualism and similar concepts. For the writer of our text, these ideas come from the nature of things and direct experience. While the form of expression may have geographical influences, I am not convinced that any clear lineage has been established for this supposed interpolation.

The Feminine Divinity, close to the Highest God, is not separate from Him but is His Will. In the Pleroma Vision, He is as much male and female as in the general narrative, transcending all opposites and containing them within Himself. It is evident that this combination of visions represents an early and simple form of Gnosis. This form appears later in Christian writings, especially in the detailed teachings of the Basilidian and Valentinian schools. These systems can be compared point by point with our text, but such an analysis would be too lengthy for our current study and would require a separate volume.THE SECOND EMANATION

9. Let's return to the main story. Inside the World-Egg, which was surrounded by a powerful force (the Gnostic Horos), three Cosmic Elements—Fire, Air, and Water-Earth—had already developed. This happened because the Cosmic Logos descended into the Primal Elements of Disorder. As the Logos descended, Fire and Air rose, and the Logos stayed in Water-Earth. This was the result of the First Outpouring from the Power of the Pleroma, the First Word spoken by Mind. The Second Outpouring from Mind was no longer just Light, but Light and Life, Male-Female. This emanation appeared as the Enforming Mind—the creator or shaper of lives or souls. It gave life to the Ordered Elements of Nature, bringing them together into forms. The Great Mind, as Light and Life, reflected itself in the "pure formation" of Nature—in Fire and Spirit (Air), Fire for Light and Spirit for Life, to further shape things. The Mighty Power or Self-limitation of Mind, the Boundary that no mortal can cross, marks the formative area of the entire cosmos. This area, however, is not just the mixed, sensible world that we perceive with our physical senses. Instead, it contains various orders (cosmoi) of the main cosmos. The Ordering Mind, as the Soul-shaper, differentiates itself into seven Ruling Forms or Spheres that "enclose" the mixed sensible cosmos. These spheres must be of a psychic nature, made of subtle matter with reason. They form the Cosmic Engine that shapes souls or psychic natures and continually transforms them.Their actions and energies are like Fate, representing the ordered sequence of cause and effect, symbolized by spheres that continually cycle. In all major phases, there's a pattern of descending darkness followed by an upward movement. Darkness falls, then transforms and yearns for Light. The Word comes down; immediately, Fire and Air rise. The Formative Mind descends; then the Word rises from the mixed Water-Earth, aligning with its essential emanation from the Father, and moves to a space around the Seven, leaving the downward elements in Water-Earth without its immediate presence after giving physical matter its initial order. This physical matter is called "pure matter," meaning matter without the immediate presence of Reason.

From this impulse, Nature begins her physical formation, developing her physical elements and bodies of non-rational life. Water-Earth separates into water and earth, and also air, which is different from the Spirit-Air that ascended; this lower air is one of the downward elements.

THE DESCENT OF MAN

After this, a Third Outpouring occurred—the descent of Man, completing the formation of all things with a higher manifestation of Mind, the One Form that contains all forms, His Very Image equal to Himself. He finally comes to complete and save the cosmos in the Form of Man, to gather it to Himself and return it to the Pleroma. However, the Word, the Formative Mind, and Man are not three separate entities; they are co-essential with each other and one with the Father. The Word is co-essential with the Creative Mind (section 10), the Creative Mind is the Brother of Man (section 13), and Man is equal with God (section 12).Man, the Beloved, descends, and in his descent, he is endowed with the creative powers of his Brother, combining Life and rational Light. After understanding the structures and limits of the Spheres, he desires to break through the Great Boundary. To do this, he must descend further into matter. Before he can rise, he must go down.

Thus, he descends through the Spheres, seeking Nature below, and shows her his Divine Form, radiant with the energies given to him by the Powers above. In her great love, Nature wraps herself around the image reflected in her water and the shadow cast on her earth. Just as Darkness entwined itself around the lower parts of Light like a Great Serpent, Nature coils around the shadow and reflection of Man. Man exists above and below; he is free yet willingly bound by love for her, who is essentially himself.

Reitzenstein (pp. 47-49) finds this complex and tries to identify conflicting elements, suggesting they are a mix of different traditions. I cannot clearly follow his reasoning. The authors of our text did not create new ideas or terms; they used what was familiar to them and their circle. Their goal was to present these "things seen" in the most understandable terms. Those with the "sight" would appreciate their work, while those without it would never understand, regardless of the terms or language used.When Reitzenstein (p. 47) says that in section 11, the creation of irrational beings by Nature involves contradictory ideas, he fails to understand that Nature is always the World-Soul, the partner of Mind; though she is Darkness, she is the partner of Light. On her own, she creates irrational beings, which is an incomplete process. Similarly, in section 13, Reitzenstein identifies contradictory elements and attributes them to different ideas. However, he does not realize that although in one sentence the "formations" are said to be by the Father and in the next by the Brother, there is no real confusion. This is because the Formative Mind is the Father, forming Himself within Himself. This self-energizing aspect can be considered separate from the Father but is not truly so. Additionally, I do not see any real contradiction in the breaking through of the Spheres as if they were created by a power opposing the Son. Fate was indeed seen this way by those under its influence, but our treatise aims to provide insight into the state of things beyond Fate. The main teaching is that all these oppositions are illusions; humans can overcome these limits and attain the freedom of the Sons of God. Even the most severe and fundamental oppositions are illusory and are Self-limitations of God's Will; humans are Sons of God equal to Him.

THE FIRST MEN

Our treatise then describes the first appearance of man on earth, which it views as a great mystery never revealed before, "the mystery kept hidden until this day." I interpret this to mean that it had never been written about before and was kept as a great secret.The secret doctrine stated that the first humans, of which there were seven types, were hermaphrodites and lived in the air. Their bodies were made of fire and spirit, not earth and water. The Celestial Man, representing humanity, gradually changed from a pure nature of Light and Life, adopting bodies of fire and air, transforming into mind (Light-fire) and soul (Life-spirit). This change presumably took a long time, with lower animal forms evolving to greater complexity as Nature tried to copy the "Form" of Man, while Man gradually devolved until a union occurred, allowing humans to inhabit the highest animal forms. The first incarnate humans were also likely hermaphrodites, and it was a time when everything was more fluid than it is now.

"INCREASE AND MULTIPLY"

18. After this period of pre-sexual or bi-sexual development ended, the sexes separated. The command was given: "Increase in number and multiply in multitude" (ayxanesthe en ayxe'sei kai plethunesthe en ple'thei). This echoes a common phrase from the Greek Targum of Genesis,—ayxanesthe kai plethunesthe,—but it is only a slight resemblance. The main command is stronger, and the rest of the text is different from anything found in Genesis. Since nothing else in the treatise directly refers to Hebrew influence, we conclude that this phrase was commonly known and has crept into our treatise.

However, this phrase led to a critical note added in the margin of one manuscript (Par. 1220) by a later writer, which was then included in the text of another manuscript (Vat. 951).The text attributed to Psellus criticizes Hermes, calling him a sorcerer and a plagiarist of Moses. Essentially, it portrays the Devil as a deceiver who uses truth to mislead people. This tells us more about the limitations of Psellus, often referred to as the "Prince of Philosophers," than anything else.

The process of increasing and multiplying, the continuous joining of bodies, and the birth of new ones is governed by Fate or the Harmony of the Formative Spheres, which is the mechanism of birth under the guidance of Providence (pronoia). This Providence is essentially Nature itself, representing the Wisdom or Knowledge of God, or simply His Will. The driving force behind all of this is Love. If Love manifests as a desire for material things, the Lover remains in Darkness. However, if it becomes the Will to seek Light, the Lover gains self-knowledge and eventually unites with Good.

Why does love of the body lead to Death, making man mortal? The disciple offers an explanation based on his observations. Although his answer is accepted, its meaning remains unclear. The physical body, or body in the material world, is made up of Moist Nature, which later becomes Water-Earth, and eventually splits into the elements of earth, water, and air. The breakdown of these elements is caused by Death, symbolizing Darkness, which drains the Water, representing the Typhonean Power. Water here symbolizes the Osirian Power of growth and cohesion. Moist Nature seems to be different from Darkness due to the energizing effect of Light. But since Light is also Life, Darkness, as its ultimate opposite, represents Death.

The disciple then discusses the Path to Immortality. He repeats his lesson, and the Master approves. The Path Upwards is the Way of Self-Knowledge.The disciple still finds it hard to believe that this is meant for him. He can't grasp that Mind is within him, or rather is him, because Mind as Teacher seems to be outside him. The play is on "Mind" and "mind"; one gives the certainty of Immortality, while the other is still trapped by the illusion of Death. The disciple lacks this certainty; therefore, Mind is not his.

22. The Master further explains the mystery: Gnosis must be preceded by moral purification; one must turn away before they can return. The whole nature must be transformed. Yet every effort that the individual seems to make is actually powered by the Great Man.

23. However, those who give in to lower desires drive the Mind away, and their appetites are only strengthened by the mind. This paragraph's text is very corrupt, making it impossible to recover the exact meaning. This makes it harder to understand the concept of the Avenging Daimon, the Counterpart of the Mind. This difficulty is compounded by section 24, which states that the "way of life" is surrendered to the Daimon at death. Refer to "The Vision of Er" in the Miscellanea of the "Prolegomena" for a Platonic view of the Daimon and "way of life." In our treatise, however, the teaching is more intimate and must be considered alongside C. H., x. (xi.) 16 and 21, where we will comment on it further.

THE ASCENT OF THE SOUL

24. The current topic is the Way Above (anodos), or the soul's ascent out of the body at death. The physical body is left to undergo change and dissolution. The life of integration and preservation ends, and the life of disintegration begins.The form (eidos) seemingly leaves the man's awareness; that is to say, he is no longer in his physical body but appears to be in another form. The specific form or "way of life" he had on earth is given to the Daimon, now without energy, becoming an empty shell. The following sentence is confusing and I can only guess its meaning. The senses that were once united by the mind become separate—they turn from a whole into parts (mere), returning to a natural animal state of sensation. The animal part of the man, his vehicle of passion and desire, begins to break down, with the mind or reason (logos) gradually separating from it. The man's true nature emerges as he sheds his irrational tendencies.

These irrational tendencies originate from the Harmony of the Fate-Sphere, which consists of seven subordinate spheres or zones. In these zones, he leaves his inharmonious tendencies, now without energy. The Harmony may seem evil, but it is actually the Engine of Justice and Necessity, correcting the soul's foolish choices and purifying its irrational desires—those not governed by reason and philosophy.

For a better understanding of the "seven spheres," we must refer to another section, found in chapter xii of the "Prolegomena," titled "Concerning the Seven Zones and their Characteristics." This commentary relates to section 25. Now, we continue with the treatise.

THE EIGHTH SPHERE

26. The soul of the initiated sheds the "garment of shame"—selfish actions—and stands "clothed in its own power."This likely refers to shedding the "shell of self," the layers created by one's vices, and donning the "wedding garment" of one's virtues. This state is called the Eighth, a state of relative "sameness" that surpasses the areas of "difference." It is the Ogdoad of the Gnostics, the Jerusalem Above, the plane of the true self, the natural state of "those-that-are." In another sense, it may mean that after moving through the stages of the lower mind, a person enters the realm of the pure mind, the Higher Self, and unites with all the experiences of past lives that are worthy of immortality—his virtuous actions, the "those-that-are," which may be the "crown of mighty lives" praised by the Pythian Oracle when celebrating the death of Plotinus.

In this state, the person who has freed himself from the cycle of reincarnation hears the Song of the Powers above the Ogdoad—in Gnostic terms, the Hymn of the Aeons of the Pleroma. Such a person would have completed his earthly journey and be ready to enter the Christ-state or, at the very least, the state of super-man. He would be the Victor who has earned the right to wear the Robe of Glory and receive the honor of the Kingship of the Heavens. This Final Initiation is beautifully described in the opening pages of the Pistis Sophia, especially in the Song of the Powers, which begins with the words: "Come unto us, for we are your fellow-members. We are all one with you."The essence of the mystery is that the pure personalities of the Individual Ego, or the total sum of all these purified personalities, willingly merge into a complete union. In this state, they become the forces or energies of a New Man, the true Son of Man. They blend with each other, retaining their individuality but realizing the full potential of their powers through this union. In this divine Sonship, they are no longer confined by physical bodies or individual souls or minds. Instead, they become Powers, fully united with the Divine Will and ultimately, God Himself. The Shepherd exemplified this; he was considered the Christ of God, the Son of the Father, who could take any form to fulfill the Divine Will. Once his purpose was served, the Shepherd would "mingle with the Powers" again.

THE THREE "BODIES" OF THE BUDDHA

The Shepherd was seen as a Christ in Christian tradition and a Buddha in Eastern terms. This can be understood by examining the "three bodies" (trikaya) of a Buddha, as Buddhahood transcends individual existence. According to the Chinese version of Ashvaghosha's now-lost Sanskrit treatise, Mahayana-shraddhotpada-shastra:

"All Buddhas see all sentient beings as part of themselves and do not cling to their individual forms. This is because they understand that all sentient beings and their own selves originate from the same Suchness, and no distinctions can be made among them."All Buddhas embody the truth itself and have nothing to do with conditional reality or obligatory actions. However, the perceptions of sentient beings (seeing, hearing, etc.) influence the actions of the Buddhas.

These actions have two aspects:

1. The first aspect arises from the consciousness that distinguishes phenomena. This is how the actions of Buddhas are perceived by those who are not yet Bodhisattvas. This aspect is called the Body of Transformation (Nirmanakaya). People in this category do not realize that the Body of Transformation is merely a reflection of their evolving consciousness. They mistakenly believe it comes from an external source and give it physical limitations. However, the Body of Transformation, or the truth itself (Dharmakaya), is beyond any limitations or measurements. Essentially, a Buddha can only communicate with such minds through forms, which are actually representations of their own advanced consciousness. There are also others who are aware of the "formless" state but haven't yet achieved Nirvanic Consciousness. These individuals are called Bodhisattvas.

2. The second aspect is based on the activity-consciousness, through which Bodhisattvas, from their initial aspiration to their highest state, perceive the actions of the Buddhas. This is called the Body of Bliss (Sambhogakaya).

The term "formless state" refers to states of consciousness in realms called Arupa, which are formless only to those who haven't reached the Bodhisattva level. For Bodhisattvas, this Body has infinite forms.The form has endless qualities. Each quality has countless excellencies. The reward for Bodhisattvas—the place where they are destined to be born—also has endless merits and beautifications. The Body of Bliss manifests everywhere, being infinite, boundless, and limitless, directly emerging from the Mind. An older Chinese version states it is "boundless, cannot be exhausted, and is free from any signs of limitation. It appears wherever it should and always exists independently, never being destroyed."

In simpler terms, a Master who has reached Nirvanic Consciousness can teach or act on levels that are not visible to ordinary people. These levels, even when a disciple becomes aware of them, are limited by the disciple's own imperfections. The vehicles of this activity are called Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, and Nirmanakaya. The limitation of their activity depends on the disciple’s ability to function consciously in these states, known in Neo-theosophical terms as Atman, Buddhi, and Higher Manas, or more generally, the divine, spiritual, and human aspects of the self.

At the first level of conscious discipleship, the Master communicates and teaches through the Nirmanakaya. This means the Master enhances the highest form of consciousness or understanding of masterhood that the disciple has achieved so far. The Master may appear in a form that the disciple loves and recognizes, perhaps as they knew Him in person or as they heard about Him, but not His true form, which is beyond their current understanding.The next stage is when the disciple learns to transcend his ordinary ego. This doesn't mean that his true individuality is destroyed; rather, he gains the ability to manifest himself anywhere and anytime, beyond the limitations of a single ego. He reaches a higher state, free from the confines of one ego. He starts to realize that "the Self is in all and all is in the Self." 

In this state, the disciple, or Bodhisattva, is taught by the Master. The energy the Master provides is beyond our understanding and can only be described as an expanded consciousness filled with sympathy and compassion. This consciousness aims to unite with all life and with the Master's presence, known as the Sambhogakaya, or the Body of Bliss. There is an even higher state called the Dharmakaya, the true nature of Masterhood. However, it is difficult for someone who hasn't reached this level to comprehend the state of one who has achieved this transcendent unity.

With the summary of the highest teachings and the Seer's return to earthly consciousness, our treatise transitions into practical guidance on using this wisdom. This knowledge is not owned by anyone; it is held in trust for the benefit of all humanity.I believe that Sections 27 to 29 were added later and that the original text continued directly after the Shepherd's Instruction with the words: "But I recorded in my heart the Shepherd's benefaction" (Section 30). Up until the end of Section 26, the text is an intimate, personal instruction meant for a few select individuals. Given that other texts from this school emphasize keeping the teachings secret, it's likely that the original document was also kept under strict confidentiality. The instruction appears to be a reward for strict discipline, not a public sermon, suggesting that its followers were part of a select philosophical community rather than propagandists.

However, starting with Section 27, the tone changes. We see a man eager to share the knowledge and its saving power with everyone. This section vividly describes the history of this enthusiastic effort to spread the teachings. The appeal is urgent and uncompromising, akin to a call for repentance, and it feels more Hebrew and prophetic than Greek and philosophical. It appears that this push to spread the teachings was forced upon the community, compelling it to publicly announce its existence. The exact reason for this shift is unclear due to vague historical references.If we were to speculate that the powerful preaching of early Christianity caused this change, we would be missing part of the picture. Before Christianity, Jews conducted intense missionary efforts, which can be seen in the phrase "You travel over sea and land to win a single convert." This intensity is also evident in the writings of the Sibylline authors, whose style is similar to the appeals to "earth-born folk" in our text. The sunset prayer can be compared to the prayers of the Essenes and Therapeuts. 

However, the tradition of Gnosis and Saving Faith preached by our Poemandrists is clearly not Hebrew. It is a philosophical interpretation of other materials, which were also used by Jewish and Christian mystics and adapted to their own traditions. 

At the time of early Christianity, many competing traditions offered teachings on Gnosis and hopes of Salvation. I believe that all these traditions were partial expressions of a widespread spiritual awakening that was more abundant than ever before or after in the Western world. 

If my assumption about an interpolation in section 30 is correct, the original text continues here, describing the awakening of spiritual consciousness in the new disciple. From now on, everything is new for him and has new meanings. He has become a true human being, rather than a "victim of fate"; he has reached the "Plain of Truth." In Christian terms, Christ has been born in his heart consciously.

A HYMN OF PRAISE AND PRAYER FOR THE GNOSIS

31. The text concludes with a noble hymn that describes the further growth and effort of the man in spirit.From now on, his goal will be to become like the Father Himself, transitioning from being a Son to achieving complete perfection and unity with the Father. The sentence, "That I may give the Light to those in ignorance of the Race, my Brethren and Thy Sons," seems to me to either be an addition showing the same trend as the propagandist section, or an indication that the entire hymn was added at the same time as the propagandist paragraphs. The main treatise appears to end naturally and consistently in the Hellenistic tradition with the words, "I reached the Plain of Truth."

THE NAME "POIMANDRES"

Many have noted that the name "Poimandres" is irregularly formed in Greek. This has led to an interesting theory by Granger, who writes:

"Although the name Poimandres does not correspond to any Greek original, it is a close transliteration of a Coptic phrase. In the Upper Egyptian dialect, 'pemenetre' means 'the witness.' It is not unusual for the Coptic article [pe] to be treated as part of the name itself; compare the name Pior. Such a title aligns closely with the titles of other works from the same period—for example, the True Word of Celsus, or the Perfect Word, an alternative title of the Asclepius. Therefore, the term Poimandres, on this assumption, alludes to the widespread legend of Hermes as a witness, a legend verified by several sources. However, the writer has adapted the details for his purpose. Hermes is not the witness himself, but the herald of the witness."

Granger then proposes a very strange theory, contradicted by all the evidence and opposed by every authority, that the Coptic Gnostic works of the Askew and Bruce Codices were originally written in Coptic with the adoption of Greek technical terms, whereas they are clearly translations from Greek.He continues:

"There is no strong reason why such works couldn't have been written in Coptic. The Egyptian Gnostic writings from the third century have the same style as the Coptic biographies and apocalypses from the fourth century and later. So, I am inclined to believe that the Poemandres may have originally been written in Coptic. Or perhaps it was available in both languages from the beginning?"

We should say that this last suggestion is highly unlikely and reflects the writer's uncertainty. The original "Poemandres" may have actually been composed in Demotic rather than Coptic. The reasons given by Granger, based on the characteristics of Gnostic Coptic writings, are not very convincing. However, the name "Poimandres" could be a Greek transliteration of an Egyptian name, although "The Witness" might not fit the theme. In any case, "Man-Shepherd" was certainly the interpretation given to non-Egyptians by the name, despite its questionable Greek form.

THE GOOD SHEPHERD

It has not been our goal to trace the Hermes idea through pure Greek tradition, as this would divert us from our main topic. However, one element of that tradition is very interesting and worth mentioning briefly. The beautiful concept of Christ as the "Good Shepherd" is well-known to every Christian child. This first remarkable treatise shows us why Christ is the Shepherd of all men. It presents the universal doctrine without any historical dogma, highlighting an eternal truth rather than exaggerating a single instance. The depiction of Christ as the Good Shepherd was one of the earliest forms of Christian art, but the idea is much older than Christianity—it is, in fact, extremely ancient.Hermes Kriophoros statues, depicting Hermes with a ram or lamb beside him, in his arms, or on his shoulder, were popular subjects for Greek sculptors. We have examples from the archaic period of Greek art. In these early statues, Hermes wears a pointed cap instead of the later winged head-dress and sandals. This style likely originates from Chaldaean symbolic art, which featured the bearers of the twelve zodiac signs, the "sacred animals," representing the twelve classes of priests.

This shows that Greek tradition was influenced by Chaldaean wisdom even in its early days, suggesting cultural exchange before and after the "flood." This adds another layer to the Hermes concept. No tradition is entirely pure; all religions have blended elements. Syncretism, both unconscious and conscious, existed long before Alexandria, as race blending is ancient. Just as all humans are related, so are popular religions; and the theosophies of all religions share a common origin.

One of the deepest secrets of the most initiated circles was the understanding that all major religions grew from a single source. Realizing this truth later led to efforts to synthesize different religious ideas, creating harmony among seemingly contradictory philosophies.Modern research, which is primarily critical and analytical rather than integrative, labels these attempts as "syncretism." It usually uses this term negatively, suggesting the uncritical mixing of completely incompatible elements. However, as our focus shifts back towards synthesis in the coming years—which is likely since we are essentially repeating what happened in the early centuries—scholars will once again acknowledge the unity of religion despite the diversity of beliefs and revisit the old teachings of the mysteries.

Regarding the "Good Shepherd" symbol, Granger provides insightful commentary:

"Since Jesus was identified with Hermes within certain Christian circles, it is not surprising that one of the main types of Christian art, the Good Shepherd, was directly adopted from existing depictions of the Greek Hermes. According to Hippolytus, the Gnostics were particularly interested in Hermes as Hermes Logius, a figure that became more common in later Greek art. They related this title to Jesus as the Logos. Another depiction of Hermes, the Kriophoros, seemed to link Jesus as the Logos with Jesus as the Good Shepherd. These depictions of Jesus began in the second century and coincided with the appearance of the Gospel according to the Egyptians and related Gnostic texts.

"Another point suggests that the Good Shepherd symbol had earlier origins. 'It is likely that there were no statues before Constantine's time, except those of the Good Shepherd.'"We must include Hermes among the pagan figures that early Christian art adopted for its own purposes. This allows us to further address the long-standing debate about the portraits of Jesus. Since the image of the Good Shepherd is borrowed from Greek sculpture, it cannot be considered as evidence of the earliest ideas about Jesus' appearance. Therefore, arguments like those of Farrar, which claim that this image shows there was no true tradition of Christ's appearance, are invalid.

We can also shed more light on the famous inscription of Abercius. The inscription mentions a Shepherd who watches over His flock with great eyes that see in every direction and who taught the speaker to understand and believe in scriptures. This Shepherd, with his all-seeing eyes, is actually Hermes representing Christ. This weakens some of the arguments against the Christian nature of this inscription, which Harnack has overemphasized.

This aligns with our earlier writings on the symbolic representation of the Shepherd in the chapters on "Hermas" and "Hermes." We can also compare it to the Hymn to Attis from the Naassene tradition, where Attis is invoked as Pan, Bacchus, and the Shepherd of bright stars, illustrating the cosmic aspect of the mystery.

Additionally, we should note an interesting depiction on a Christian lamp and gem, likely from the third century. It shows Christ as the Good Shepherd in the style of Hermes, with a lamb on his shoulder. Above him are the Seven Planets, the Lords of Fate, along with the Sun and Moon on either side, similar to Mithraic representations.Around his feet, seven lambs gather, representing the "seven peoples," each associated with a "planet." On the right, there is Noah's dove and ark, and Jonah being swallowed by the whale. On the left, Jonah is shown again, being vomited onto land and resting peacefully under the shade of the miraculous gourd-tree. This imagery symbolizes rebirth and the mysteries of life. The lambs represent the purified lower nature of humans, with the purest essence being elevated to the head of the Great Man. This purified "little man" is swallowed by the Cosmic Fish, symbolizing the Great Mother and the Womb of the Almighty, and is then reborn to rest under his own tree in Paradise. Additionally, it is noteworthy that the Hermetic colonies in early Islamic Mesopotamia referred to their leader as the "Shepherd."

From all this, we can conclude that the concept of the Good Shepherd was a central idea in Hellenistic theology.

There's no solid evidence to date this widespread mystic gospel of Egypt to the second century rather than the first. G. (p. 411) proposes that the Gospel of the Egyptians takes place on the Mount of Olives after the resurrection, which is plausible. However, he also suggests that the title of C. H., "The Secret Sermon on the Mountain," refers to this gospel, which is unlikely since the sermon follows its own tradition.

Lowrie, in Christian Art and Archaeology (p. 290), adds to this discussion. We believe this supports the view that the evidence is conclusive. For further support, we recommend looking at the Acts of John.

Unfortunately, the text of the "General Sermon" in the Corpus Hermeticum is lost due to missing pages before Psellus obtained the parent copy.CORPUS HERMETICUM II. (III.) TO ASCLEPIUS

1. Hermes: Asclepius, isn't everything that moves, moved in something and by something?  
Asclepius: Yes, certainly.  
Hermes: And mustn't what it's moved in be greater than what is moved?  
Asclepius: It must.  
Hermes: And doesn’t the mover have more power than what is moved?  
Asclepius: Yes, of course.  
Hermes: And isn’t the nature of what it’s moved in different from the nature of what is moved?  
Asclepius: Completely.

2. Hermes: Is this cosmos not vast, so vast that nothing greater exists?  
Asclepius: Certainly.  
Hermes: And massive too, since it contains many other mighty bodies?  
Asclepius: Yes.  
Hermes: And the cosmos is a body?  
Asclepius: It is a body.  
Hermes: And it is moved?  
Asclepius: Certainly.

3. Hermes: Then how large must the space be in which it moves, and what is the nature of that space? Mustn’t it be much vaster than the cosmos to provide enough room for its movement, so it doesn’t run out of space and lose its motion?  
Asclepius: Yes, it must be immensely vast, Thrice-greatest one.

4. Hermes: And what is its nature? Mustn't it be the opposite of a body? And isn't the opposite of a body something without a body?  
Asclepius: Agreed.  
Hermes: Then space is without a body. But something without a body must be either a godlike thing or God Himself. By "godlike thing," I mean something not created but eternal.

5. If space is a godlike thing, it has substance. But if it is God Himself, it transcends substance. We should think of it differently than God. God is first "thinkable" for us, not for Himself, because what is thought falls beneath the thinker's sense.God cannot be fully understood by Himself because He is exactly what He thinks of Himself to be. For us, however, He is something different, and thus we can think about Him. 

6. If we want to think about space, we should think of it as space, not as God. If we want to think about God, we should think of Him as an energy that can contain all space. Additionally, everything that moves is moved by something stable. That which causes movement must itself be stationary because it cannot move along with what it moves. 

Asclepius: How is it, then, that things on Earth move together with those that are already moving? You said the wandering stars are moved by the fixed stars. 

Hermes: This is not a case of moving together, but of moving against each other. They do not move with one another but rather against one another. It is this opposition that turns their resistance into a form of rest. The resistance is what stabilizes their motion.

7. Therefore, the wandering stars, moving contrary to the fixed stars, are moved by one another through mutual opposition and also by the stable stars through this very opposition. It cannot be otherwise. The constellations like the Bears, which neither set nor rise, do you think they rest or move?

Asclepius: They move, Thrice-greatest one.

Hermes: And what kind of motion do they have, Asclepius?

Asclepius: Motion that forever turns around the same point.

Hermes: But this kind of revolution—motion around the same point—is fixed by rest. Because "around the same point" stops "beyond the same point." When "beyond the same point" is stopped and steadied in "around the same point," the opposite is made stable by this contrariety.

8. I'll give you an example on Earth that you can see with your own eyes. Consider a man swimming. The water moves, yet the resistance of his hands and feet gives him stability, so he is not carried away by it nor sunk by it.

Asclepius:You have provided a very clear example, Thrice-greatest one. Hermes: All motion is caused by a stationary position and within a stationary position. Therefore, the motion of the cosmos (and of every other material creature) is not caused by external factors, but by internal factors—such as soul, spirit, or some other incorporeal thing. It is not the body itself that moves the living thing; not even the whole body of the universe, even if it were lifeless.

Asclepius: What do you mean by this, Thrice-greatest one? Isn't it bodies that move immovable objects like stones and other inanimate things?

Hermes: Not at all, Asclepius. The thing inside the body, the force that moves the inanimate object, is surely not a body, because it moves both the lifter's body and the lifted object. Therefore, a lifeless thing cannot move another lifeless thing. The mover must be animate, as it is the one causing the motion. You see, then, how the soul is heavily burdened, for it alone moves two bodies. It is clear that things in motion are moved within something as well as by something.

Asclepius: Indeed, Thrice-greatest one, things in motion must be moved within a void.

Hermes: You are correct, Asclepius! For nothing that exists is void. Only "nonexistence" is void and unrelated to existence. That which exists can never become void.

Asclepius: Then, Thrice-greatest one, are there no such things as an empty cask, an empty jar, a cup, or a vat, and other things like them?

Hermes: Alas, Asclepius, for your misunderstanding! Do you think that things most full and complete are void?

Asclepius: What do you mean, Thrice-greatest one?

Hermes: Isn't air a body?

Asclepius: It is.

Hermes: And does this body not pervade all things, and by pervading, fill them?And "body"; doesn't a body consist of a blend of the "four elements"? Therefore, what you call empty space is actually full of air; and if it's full of air, it contains the "four elements."

Moreover, the reverse is also true: what you call full is actually empty—of air—because its space is occupied by other bodies, and thus, it can't hold air. So, what you say is empty should be described as hollow, not void, because it's filled with air and spirit.

12. Asclepius: Your argument, Thrice-greatest one, is undeniable; air is a body. Furthermore, this body permeates everything, filling them. What, then, should we call the space where everything moves?

Hermes: The Bodiless, Asclepius.

Asclepius: What is the Bodiless?

Hermes: It is Mind and Reason (Logos), whole and complete, self-contained, free from any body, free from all error, intangible, self-sustaining, encompassing everything, preserving all that exists. Its qualities are like rays of Goodness, Truth, Light beyond light, the Archetype of the soul.

Asclepius: What, then, is God?

13. Hermes: God is none of these things; He is the cause of their existence, both individually and collectively. He has left nothing outside His creation; everything is derived from what exists, not from nothingness. The things that don't exist have no power to be anything but have the nature of non-existence. Conversely, things that exist cannot cease to exist.

14. Asclepius: So, what do you say God is?

Hermes: God, therefore, is not Mind but the Cause of Mind; God is not Spirit but the Cause of Spirit; God is not Light but the Cause of Light. Hence, one should honor God with these two names—the Good and the Father—names that belong to Him alone and no one else.No other so-called gods, men, or spirits can be truly Good, only God is. God alone is Good and nothing else. Everything else is separate from the nature of Good because they are made of soul and body, which cannot contain Good.

The greatness of Good is as mighty as the existence of all things, both physical and non-physical, sensible and intelligible. Do not call anything else Good, for that would be impious. Also, do not call anything God except for Good alone, for that would also be impious. Although everyone speaks of Good, not everyone understands what it is. Not only is God not understood by all, but out of ignorance, some people call gods and men Good, even though they can never be or become Good. They are very different from God, while Good can never be separated from Him, because God and Good are the same. Other immortal beings are honored and called gods, but God is Good by nature, not just by title. God's nature and Good are one and the same, from which all other kinds proceed. Good is He who gives everything and receives nothing. Therefore, God gives everything and receives nothing. God is Good, and Good is God.

Another name for God is Father because He creates everything. The role of a father is to create. Therefore, having children is very important and pious for those who think rightly, and to leave life on earth without a child is a great misfortune and impiety. The person who has no child is punished by spirits after death. The punishment is that the soul of the childless person will be condemned to a body that is neither male nor female, a cursed existence under the sun.Therefore, Asclepius, do not feel sorry for the man who has no children. Instead, feel pity for his misfortune, knowing the consequences he will face. Let everything that has been discussed serve as an introduction for you, Asclepius, to the understanding of the nature of all things.

COMMENTARY

"AN INTRODUCTION TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE NATURE OF ALL THINGS"

This treatise does not have a specific title. As we have seen when discussing the composition of the Corpus, the traditional title, "Of Hermes to Tat, the General Sermon," found in all the manuscripts, does not apply to our text, which is addressed to Asclepius. Stobaeus quotes from it under the general title, "Of Hermes, from the [Sermons] to Asclepius." The theory that Sermon (II) has been lost from the parent copy of our Corpus due to the loss of some pages explains these issues so well that it is convincing, as suggested by Reitzenstein.

Interestingly, Stobaeus begins his quotations from this treatise with the same words that start our text. However, these words immediately dive into a secondary topic, leading Reitzenstein to believe there might have been a more general introduction that Johannes may have omitted. The idea that the lost pages of our Corpus contained such an introduction, broken at the exact same point to the word, seems highly unlikely. Nevertheless, the treatise itself appears to be very formal, as indicated by the concluding words (section 17), which state that it was meant to be "An Introduction to the Knowledge of the Nature of All Things."

---We are forced to conclude that, despite a highly unlikely coincidence, the beginning may have been lost. Thus, we regret losing not only the entire "General Sermon" to Tat but also the introduction to the "Introduction to the Gnosis" addressed to Asclepius. This likely included valuable information on how "Tat" and "Asclepius" are to be precisely understood. Parthey's combined title from the manuscripts, and Stobaeus's, "Of Hermes the Thrice-Greatest, the General Sermon to Asclepius," must be discarded. Instead, we must settle for the simple heading, "To Asclepius."

The topic is the Fullness of Being or the Plenum of things. Space is a Plenum, a fundamental concept in modern scientific thought. Asclepius, however, must be careful not to confuse Space with God. God is not Space but the Cause of it, the True Transcendency of "that which can contain all things." "In Him we move." "All that is moved is moved in what is stable," or "in Him who stands." Notably, the term "He who stands" is found in Philo and is significant in Gnostic tradition, especially in the Simonian Gnosis. In "The Great Announcement," preserved by Hippolytus, the Logos is called "He who stands," or "He who has stood, stands, and will stand." This represents the Reason of things that holds everything together, the Pillar of Immobility, while its opposite is the Separator or Divider. Together, they form the Cross of Manifestation, resolving the Sphere of Sameness.The World-Soul is always in motion, but this motion is organized and harmonized into a cosmos by Reason, which introduces the basic forms of motion like up, down, right, left, front, back, in, out, circular motion, and stillness. All bodies are naturally inert; it is the soul that moves them, either directly or indirectly.

I am unsure about the exact meaning of section 10. The original text was inconsistent, indicating that copyists had trouble with it. However, since the doctrine discussed is about a Plenum (as seen in other Trismegistic writings), I believe the teacher of "Asclepius" was arguing that the only Void is "non-being." Since non-being cannot exist, there can be no Void.

The "place where everything moves," where all things "live and move and exist," is the Bodiless, or the Mind and Reason of God, also known as the Logos. According to Philo, this is the Place of God, meaning Infinite Space itself, the Container of all things, and the very Spouse of Deity. Whether called Spouse or Son, it represents Wisdom, Goodness, and Truth—the Aeon of aeons, Light of light, Life of life, and the Archetype of the Soul itself.

"God, then, is not Spirit," and certainly not "a spirit," but the Cause of Spirit; for God is "Good alone." Therefore, "do not call anything else Good." Now let's consider F. C. Conybeare's important criticism of Matthew 19:17, Mark 10:18, and Luke 18.In the first issue of The Hibbert Journal, strong evidence is presented that the original text was: "Do not call me Good; only One is Good, God the Father." This version was known to Marcion, the Clementine Homilies, Athanasius, Didymus, Tatian, and indirectly to Origen.

Comparing this with our text, which says, "Do not call anything else Good, for that would be impious; only call God Good," and "He alone is Good," we see a striking similarity in phrasing and ideas. Furthermore, the contrast between "God is not Spirit" and the Johannine "God is Spirit" suggests that our treatise might have had these Christian statements in mind. However, the similarities in language and ideas between the Trismegistic literature and the New Testament are better explained by the fact that both used common Hellenistic theological expressions of the time. This means there is no need to suspect plagiarism or direct debate.

The phrase "God is Spirit" was likely a common idea among the religious-philosophical groups of the time, and Hermes is simply elaborating on this common idea. The reading "Do not call me Good," mainly preserved in Gnostic tradition, might have come from the idea that only the One is Good. It's also interesting to note that the second part of the Marcionite reading says: "There is one [only] Good, God the Father," while our treatise names God as both Good and Father. Thus, we read in section 16: "God is Good, and Good is God," and in section 17: "The other name of God is Father."The similarities between these two sets of scriptures are striking, but we remain unconvinced that there was any direct literary connection between them. It seems that their similarities come from a shared theological language and a common environment of theological ideas. 

The idea that "he who is without a wife is half a man" initially appears to be an addition by a Jewish editor, as this reflects Jewish beliefs. However, we should remember that Egyptian priests were married, and like the Pythagoreans, they believed that a man should fulfill his social duties before dedicating himself to a contemplative life. This included having children, not only to continue the race but also to provide bodies for advanced souls to be born into favorable conditions, ensuring the continuation of the Order. This principle is also found in the ancient Hindu text, the Manava Dharma Shastra, which states that household duties must be completed before one can retire to a life of contemplation.

In certain cases, exceptions could be made. Asclepius might represent students who were still living married lives. A thirteenth-century scribe, in Codex B. (Parisinus, 1220), dismissively noted "nonsense" in the margin next to this paragraph, likely indicating his disapproval as a monk.

CORPUS HERMETICUM III. (IV.) THE SACRED SERMON OF HERMES

(Text: P. 31-33; Pat. 8b-9.)

1. The glory of everything is God, the divine nature. The source of all things is God, who is both Mind and Nature, as well as Matter and Wisdom that reveals everything. God is also the source of Nature, Energy, Necessity, and Renewal. 

In the boundless darkness of the Abyss, there was Water and a subtle intelligent Breath. These existed by the Power of God in Chaos. Then Holy Light arose and underneath the Dry Space, elements formed from Moist Essence.

[p. 76]

2. When all things were undefined and unformed, the lighter things were assigned to the heights, while the heavier ones settled under the moist part of Dry Space. Universal elements were bound by Fire and suspended in Breath to keep them up. Heaven appeared in seven circles with Gods visible as stars and their signs. Nature's parts formed together with the Gods. Heaven's boundary revolved in a cyclic course, driven by the Breath of God.

3. Each God, by their own power, created what they were destined to. Thus, four-footed beasts, creeping things, aquatic creatures, winged beings, seed-bearing plants, grass, and flowers all came into existence, each containing the seed of regeneration.And they chose the births of men for the understanding of God's works and the demonstration of Nature's energy. The multitude of men were chosen for dominion over everything under Heaven and for the knowledge of its blessings, so they might grow and multiply. Every soul incarnated through the cycles of the Gods, to observe the wonders of Heaven and the revolutions of Heaven's Gods, and to understand the works of God and the energy of Nature. This was to show its blessings and understand the power of God, so they might know the consequences of good and evil deeds and learn the skill of all good arts.

This is how their life and wisdom begin, according to the fate set by the revolution of the Cyclic Gods, and their passing away follows this pattern. Their mighty works on Earth will leave a lasting mark, even when cycles renew. Every birth of flesh and seed, and every handiwork, though it may decay, will necessarily renew itself by the Gods' renovation and Nature's rhythmic cycle. As God constantly renews the cosmic mixture, Nature is also co-established in that divine process.COMMENTARY

TEXT AND TITLE

The text appears to be very corrupted, and at one point, I thought it was incomplete. However, it might well conclude with the mention of the mighty deeds of ancient men. The title "Sacred Sermon" suggests something special, likely forming a basis of doctrine. We know of the "Sacred Sermon" of Orpheus and Pythagoras, which were considered the most sacred teachings of their respective mystic schools and were held in high reverence. These sermons seemingly provided the foundational principles of these systems. Similarly, our treatise serves as a summary of the general ideas of the "Shepherd" cosmogony, adapted for simpler understanding. Reitzenstein (p. 193) briefly mentions this treatise as the preaching of some prophet, later attributed to Hermes by the editor of our Corpus. He implies that this doctrine may be different from the cosmogonical ideas of the "Shepherd." While comparing the details of both treatises reveals significant contradictions, the overall essence and atmosphere are the same.

THE TRINITY

The cosmogenesis is introduced with a formal theological prelude, whose exact meaning is unclear due to its almost mnemonic nature, resembling sutra style. However, there seems to be a distinct trinitarian idea in the first sentence, consisting of God (o Theos), Godhead (to theion), and Nature (e fusis). This Divine Trinity embodies the Glory or Power of all things. The Source (or Beginning), the End, and the Ever-renewing of all things derive from this Triad. All three terms seem almost interchangeable.The Godhead is the Mind of God, and Godly Nature is the Wisdom of God. At the end of the sermon (section 4), we are told that the Godhead (or what is Divine) is "Nature's ever-renewing cosmic mixture." The Godhead in action is Nature, while Nature is also part of the Godhead, and both are united in God, the Source of everything. The creation of the cosmos starts with the grand image: "Boundless Darkness was in the Abyss." In our discussion on "Darkness" in the "Poemandres" treatise, we referred to a Gnostic tradition where the Primal Elements are Water, Darkness, Abyss, and Chaos. We suggested that this tradition might come from ancient Egypt, a tradition similar to the Sumerian one, both originating from an even older source.

Now, if we look at Epiphanius (who learned about the Gnostics in Egypt), we find that he preserved a similar idea from another Gnostic system. The Bishop of Salamis denounced the Nicolaitans, who he believed were the earliest Christian Gnostics. There were many different sects of them, all tracing back to a man named Nicolaus, who Epiphanius claimed was one of the first seven deacons of the Church. However, if the Nicolaitans were the same as the Balaamites in early Talmudic Rabbinism, then the original Nicolaitans were the earliest Christians. "Balaamites" was a Rabbinical term for the followers of Balaam (Bileam) = Jeschu, and Balaam = Nicolaos in Hebrew and Greek respectively.Interestingly enough, in the paragraph (section 4) before the one we are about to quote, Epiphanius attributes the use of the mystic words "Kaulakau Kaulakau" to the Nicolaitans. We have shown with high probability in the chapter "Myth of Man in the Mysteries" (section 16 J., end) that these words were used by a Jewish Gnostic during the time of Philo, writing in an Egyptian context and discussing the Man-tradition, which is a key part of the "Poemandres" doctrine. This takes us back to the early days of Christianity. Regarding these Nicolaitans, Epiphanius writes (xxv. 5):

"Others of them, again, combine empty names, saying: There was Darkness, Abyss (bythos), and Water; and Spirit in their midst separated them."

Here, we see the same elements used to form a cosmogonical representation. We can't say for certain how these various traditions are related, but we do know that the authors of our treatise are working with material common to pre-Christian Jewish Gnosticism and the earliest forms of Christian Gnosis.

THE "BOOKS OF THE CHALDAEANS"

The phrase in section 2, "All things being undefined and yet unwrought (akataskeyastun)," should be noted and compared with the opening sentence of the cosmogony in the LXX version of Genesis 1:2:

"And the earth was invisible and as yet unwrought (akataskeuastos), and Darkness was upon the Abyss, and the Spirit of God moved upon the Water."

Should we then assume that our Trismegistic writer directly based his work on this famous "oracle" of Jewish Scripture?The Jewish Gnostics likely followed this approach in their commentaries. However, the Christianized Jewish Gnostic systems suggest that these Gnostic Jews did not get their ideas directly from their Scriptures, but from parallel, esoteric traditions. We will see later, when discussing Zosimus, that Chaldaean sacred books were translated and available in the Alexandrian Library. It is reasonable to believe that the general ideas of Chaldaean cosmology were well-known to scholars of the time. Chaldaea and Egypt were considered the two most wise and sacred nations of antiquity. Therefore, it is not surprising that Chaldaean and Egyptian ideas were combined and refined into a "scientific" whole by Greek philosophical thought in our treatises. I conclude that both here and in the repetition of the formula "increase in increasing and multiply in multitude" from the "Poemandres" treatise, the similarities are not due to direct copying but to the fact that such ideas were widely known.

I also suggest that the term akataskeuastos was not originally from the Greek translation of Genesis made in Alexandria around 250 B.C., but was instead taken from the theological and philosophical language of the time and used by Hebrew translators. In the LXX translation, we see the strong influence of Hellenistic theology. Regarding our treatise, I suggest that it presents the main topics to be explained and commented upon later, rather than a clear, didactic work.The cosmogenesis, like the introduction, is highly condensed. It's so brief that we can't form a clear picture of the process described. We only have a series of headings that likely meant something specific to the writer and may have encapsulated an entire doctrine for them. However, for us, lacking detailed knowledge, these headings hold little precise meaning. Additionally, the text seems to be flawed. Due to its brevity, copyists and readers might have added their own notes to make it clearer, which, without understanding the original intent, blurred the original meaning, causing our confusion.

The most notable doctrine discussed is that of Renewal or Making-new-again (ananeusis). All animal and plant forms contain within themselves "the seed of becoming again" (to sperma teis paliggenesias). This likely doesn't just mean the species continues, because it states that "every birth of flesh ensouled... shall necessarily renew itself (ananeuthe'setai)." This suggests the doctrine of palingenesis or "reincarnation," the renewal on the karmic wheel of birth and death (fuseus kukloy enarithmioy dromema).

The final point to note is the sentence: "And there shall be mighty memorials of their handiworks upon the earth, leaving dim traces behind when cycles are renewed." The writer seems to reflect on a past time when a great race, dedicated to gaining wisdom, lived on earth and left significant monuments of their wisdom. These monuments left faint traces visible "in the renewal of the times."This passage seems to reference the general belief of the time, often mistakenly called Stoic, that there were alternating periods of destruction by fire and water, followed by renewal. In Egypt, it was commonly believed that the last destruction occurred through a flood. The author believed that before this flood, there was a great race of Egyptians associated with the First Hermes, and that remnants of this ancient, wise civilization could still be found.

I am personally inclined to believe in this tradition, and I have speculated that there might be remains of prehistoric structures, possibly similar to pyramids, buried beneath one or more of the existing pyramids that survived the flood.

Thrice-Greatest Hermes, Vol. 2, by G.R.S. Mead, [1906], at sacred-texts.com

Corpus Hermeticum IV. (V.)

The Cup or Monad of Hermes to Tat

Hermes: The World-maker created the universe with Reason (Logos), not with hands. You should think of Him as being everywhere and always present, the Creator of everything, and the One and Only. His Body is intangible, invisible, and immeasurable, unlike any other form. It is neither Fire, Water, Air, nor Breath, yet all these elements come from it. Because He is Good, He chose to dedicate this Body to Himself alone, organizing and adorning the Earth.

So, He sent the Cosmos to Earth, creating man—a being that is immortal yet experiences mortality.And over all other lives and the entire universe, man excelled because of Reason (Logos) and the Mind. Man became a contemplator of God's works, marveled at them, and sought to understand their Creator.

Reason (Logos) has been distributed among all men, but not everyone has been given Mind. This is not because God withholds it, as grudge does not come from Him, but rather it exists within the souls of men who lack Mind.

Tat: Why did God not bestow Mind on everyone, father?

Her: God wanted it to be a prize for souls to strive for.

Tat: Where did He place this prize?

Her: He filled a mighty Cup with it and sent it down with a Herald, commanding him to make this proclamation to the hearts of men:

"Baptize yourself with this Cup's baptism. Whoever has faith and understands this can ascend to Him who sent down the Cup and know why they came into being."

Those who understood the Herald's message and immersed themselves in Mind became partakers in the Gnosis. Once they received the Mind, they became "perfect men." Those who did not understand the message, possessing only Reason and not Mind, remain ignorant of their purpose and origin.

The senses of such men are like those of irrational creatures. As their whole focus is on feelings and impulses, they fail to appreciate things truly worth contemplation. They center their thoughts on bodily pleasures and appetites, believing that they exist for these purposes.

However, those who have received some portion of God's gift, Tat, show through their deeds that they have won release from Death's bonds. They embrace within their own Mind all things—things on earth, in heaven, and beyond, if such things exist.And having reached this point, they glimpse the Good; and upon seeing it, they view their stay here as unfortunate. Disdaining both physical and non-physical things, they hurry towards that One and Only One. 

This, Tat, is the Knowledge of the Mind, the vision of divine things; it is God-knowledge, for the Cup belongs to God. 

Tat: Father, I also want to be baptized. 

Her: Unless you first despise your body, my son, you cannot truly love yourself. But if you love yourself, you will gain Mind, and with Mind, you will share in Knowledge.

Tat: Father, what do you mean?

Her: It is not possible, my son, to dedicate yourself to both perishable things and divine things. Since there are two types of things, the body and the bodiless, which represent the perishable and the divine, a person must choose one or the other; they can never coexist. For those who have the choice, the decline of one leads to the growth of the other.

Choosing the Better not only results in a fair outcome for the one who makes the choice, making the person a god, but also demonstrates their piety to God. On the other hand, choosing the Worse destroys the "man" and disrupts God's harmony, much like a procession that blocks the road for others; such people move through life led by their bodily pleasures.

Therefore, Tat, what comes from God has always been and will always be ours; but what depends on us, let us strive for it without delay. It is not God but we who are the cause of evil things, preferring them to good.You see, son, how many bodies we must pass through, how many groups of spirits, how vast the paths of the stars through which our journey lies, to reach the One and Only God. For the Good has no other end; it has no boundaries; it is endless; and for itself, it has no beginning either, though to us it seems to start with knowledge. 

Therefore, for it, knowledge is not a beginning; rather, knowledge provides us the first step to knowing it. Let us seize this beginning and quickly move through everything we must pass. It is very hard to leave the things we are accustomed to, which surround us, and turn back to the ancient path. Appearances delight us, while things that do not appear are hard to believe in. Now, evils are more apparent, while the Good can never show itself to the eyes, for it has neither form nor shape. Therefore, the Good is like itself alone and unlike all other things; for it is impossible for something without a body to make itself visible to a body.

The superiority of the "Like" over the "Unlike" and the inferiority of the "Unlike" to the "Like" consists in this:

The Oneness, being the Source and Root of all things, is in everything as the Root and Source. Without this Source, nothing exists; while the Source itself arises from nothing but itself, since it is the Source of everything else. It is its own Source, as it cannot have another Source. The Oneness, then, being the Source, contains every number but is contained by none; it generates every number but is generated by no other one.

Now, all that is generated is imperfect; it is divisible and subject to increase and decrease. But with the Perfect One, none of these things apply.That which can grow increases from the Oneness, but it weakens when it can no longer hold onto the One due to its own frailty. And now, Tat, God's image has been outlined for you as much as possible. If you focus on it and reflect with your heart, believe me, my son, you will find the path that leads upward. In fact, that image will become your guide because the Divine Sight has a unique charm. It holds and draws those who manage to open their eyes, just as a magnet attracts iron.**COMMENTARY**

**THE TITLE**

This beautiful treatise, where the key principles of Gnosis are clearly explained by the philosopher-mystic who wrote it centuries ago, has a triple title: "From Hermes to Tat: The Cup or Monad [or Oneness]." The double title is essentially a choice of names, as The Cup represents The Oneness—The One Element, the "Body" of God, which causes all bodies but is itself bodiless. In other words, the Monad is the Intelligible Cosmos itself, God's Image, also called His Only-begotten Son. The concept of a Cup or Mixing-bowl (Crater), symbolizing an all-encompassing receptacle where all elements are blended, and representing a transcendent Unity, the source of all measurable and countable things, was a main doctrine of the Trismegistic tradition. This is evident from Poemandrist Zosimus, who particularly mentions this Cup as a symbol of Spiritual Baptism—immersion of one's entire nature into the Great Ocean of Spirit or Mind, making a person filled with Life and illuminated with Light.To understand the symbolism of the Crater or Cup, readers should refer to the chapter on this topic in the "Prolegomena." It is suggested there that this symbolism likely came from Orphic traditions, although the Egyptians had similar ideas. This document should be read alongside "C. H., xi. (xii.), 'The Mind to Hermes,'" which serves as its "esoteric" counterpart. In that text, what Hermes teaches Tat here is taught to Hermes by the Mind. Here, the teachings are for beginners, while there, they are for advanced disciples. In Mystery terms, what is taught to the Mystes here is revealed to the Epopt there. 

Now, the instruction to Tat begins:

### The Baptism of the Mind

1. Everything is created by Reason, the Formative Energy of the Mind. The Ideal Cosmos, or World-Order, is the Divine Body.
2. Earth represents the tangible Cosmos; on Earth, man, who is the image of God's Reason, rules. Man's purpose is to contemplate God's works. The "wonder" inspired by these marvels will eventually lead to a knowledge of God. This "wonder" is the start of True Philosophy or God-knowledge.
3. All humans have "reason" (a spark of the Logos), but few possess "Mind." This "mind" is the true offspring of Mind, the real, perfect man, aware of his true Self. This self-awareness is the ultimate goal for souls: the crown of humanity, the Christ-state, or the state of the true man. The Christ-Baptism involves immersing one's entire nature into the Mind-filled Cup, the Pleroma of the Divine Being, whose Body and Mind are united. Isn't the Cup the Body of God, "consecrated unto Himself alone," the Universal Body of all things?### The Holy Grail

It is intriguing to consider the possible connection between this Cup of Initiation and the Mystic Eucharist, as well as its origins in the Grail tradition. A great master of music and song in our time, Wagner, has brought this tradition to life through his unforgettable melodies, giving it a more universal significance. Wagner's poetic intuition about this marvelous vision can be seen in his own words:

"To the enraptured gaze of one longing for celestial love, the clear blue atmosphere of heaven seems at first to form a wonderful, barely visible, but dazzlingly beautiful vision. Then, with increasing clarity, the angelic host appears with delicate outlines, carrying the holy vessel as it descends from the blazing heights of heaven. As the vision becomes more distinct, the heart throbs with the ecstasy of the moment; and when the Grail finally reveals itself in all its glory, the viewer's mind reels, and they fall into a state of adoring awe. The angelic host then returns to the heavenly heights, fading away into the nothingness from which it first emerged."

For the Seers of the Gnosis, there was a deeper understanding. They were encouraged to cast aside all hesitation and fearlessly immerse themselves into the very Cup itself, the Ocean of Divine Love and Wisdom. This was the Good News, the message of God's Herald to humanity, proclaiming that those with true faith could "ascend to Him who had sent down the Cup," God's Greatest Gift. It is through such a Baptism, not merely a symbolic sprinkling with water, that humanity is to be redeemed. This represents the culmination of man's earthly journey, the realization of the "Gnosis of the Mind, Vision of things Divine; God-knowledge is it; for the Cup is God's."In section 6, we discussed the mystic discipline of "hating the body," which is not meant to be taken literally. Misunderstanding this concept led many mystics, both historically and generally, to mistakenly believe that the body or matter was the source of evil. This misunderstanding gave rise to practices of self-mortification and punishment of the flesh, which were introduced by monks into Christianity and still persist in some areas today. However, the common sense of Christianity, based on the general teachings of Christ, has always opposed this view.

The mystic philosopher advises his followers to hate the body because they are in the early stages of spiritual awakening and haven't yet activated their "Mind." At this initial phase, it's important to develop a clear sense of the difference between good and evil, love and hate, to strengthen the disciple's will towards good and weaken it towards bad. When the disciple's will is equally balanced between the two, and he can choose good as easily as evil, only then is he ready to learn a greater lesson: true wisdom lies in balance, in the Middle Way. Nothing is inherently evil—the body is as honorable and essential in its role as the mind is in its. The disciple learns the secret that having one's thoughts always in heaven is as wrong as having them always on earth. There is a higher way of living where the things of heaven and earth are interconnected.

As stated in the Introduction to The Book of the Great Logos according to the Mystery:

"Jesus says: Blessed is the person who understands this Word (Logos), and has brought down Heaven and lifted up Earth towards Heaven."Heaven and Earth must unite for this ultimate union, this truly Sacred Marriage. However, in the third Synoptic Gospel (Matthew 16:25-26), we read:

"Jesus says: If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father, mother, wife, children, brothers, sisters, and even his own soul, he cannot be My disciple." Here, the word "hate" (misei) is the same as in our text. This "dark saying" was interpreted in a mystical sense by Gnostic tradition, not as referring to physical parents but to the past causes of our imperfections. I have mentioned this interpretation several times.

Therefore, in a Gnostic teaching like our treatise, the terms "hate" and "body" should not be taken literally. This is evident from the statement in section 8: "For it is not God but we who cause evil things by choosing them over good." Here, the cause of evil is attributed to human choice, not the body. To support this, we can refer to the Sermon to Asclepius, C. H., vi. (vii.) 6:

"Such are the things that men call good and beautiful, Asclepius--things which we cannot flee or hate."

THE GNOSIS AND ITS BLESSINGS

In section 9, note the phrase: "Therefore to It Gnosis is not a beginning; rather, Gnosis gives us the first beginning of Its being known." Compare this with the saying quoted by the Jewish commentator in the Naassene Document (section 25): "The Beginning of Perfection is Gnosis of Man, but Gnosis of God is Perfect Perfection." The claim for Gnosis is thus modest. Gnosis is not an end in itself; it is just the beginning of the True Knowledge of God. Those who receive the Baptism of the Mind become "perfect men," but not yet Perfect; they only reach true manhood after receiving this touch of Christ-consciousness.Those who have received this Baptism understand the purpose of life. They become aware of their immortality and know they are deathless, rather than just believing it. Their immortality is a known fact. They have freed themselves from Death and Fate and understand the true nature of the cosmos up to the Threshold of the Good, the Plain of Truth, which can be compared to the Nirvanic state of consciousness in Buddhist terms. However, they have not yet entered Nirvana or become one with the Logos. They have seen Nirvana but have not entered that "Blessed Space," which, as Basilides says, "cannot be described by any word."

This vision is a promise of what they can become. They have become like Gods or Angels, enjoying the same freedom and consciousness, but there is an even higher state when they will become one with Deity Himself.

Leaving the familiar things behind is difficult, but it must be done to follow the Way of Gnosis. This path is not new; it is a return to the Old Old Way, the Archaic Wisdom of Ancient Egypt. For the followers of Thrice-greatest Hermes, this ancient wisdom was the Gnosis.## Corpus Hermeticum V. (VI.) Though Unseen, God is Most Visible

### Hermes to His Son Tat

(Text: P. 41-48; Pat. 12b-13b.)

1. I will share this wisdom with you, Tat, so you may understand the mysteries of the Nameless God. Pay close attention, as what seems hidden to many will become clear to you. If God were obvious, He wouldn't be God, because everything obvious is subject to change. The Unseen God always exists and reveals everything else, but He Himself remains hidden. God, being uncreated, makes everything else visible by His will.

2. Only He who is uncreated is beyond all understanding and remains unseen. Yet, He reveals Himself through all things, especially in those He chooses to make visible.First, Tat, my son, pray to our Lord and Father, the One from whom everything comes, to show you mercy so that you may understand even a small part of this mighty God. Only thought can perceive the Unmanifest because thought itself is unmanifest. If you have the ability, He will show Himself to your mind’s eye. The Lord does not withhold Himself from anything but reveals Himself through the whole world. You have the power to think, to grasp it, and to see God’s Image directly.

But if what is inside you is hidden from you, how can He who is within you be revealed to you through your outer eyes? 

If you want to "see" Him, think of the sun, the moon’s path, and the order of the stars. Who oversees this order? Every order is defined by place and number. The sun is the greatest god in the heavens, to whom all heavenly gods give way as to a king and master. This great sun, greater than the earth and sea, allows smaller stars to circle above it. Out of respect or fear of whom does it do this? Each star has its unique path in the heavens. Who determines the manner and extent of their paths?

The Bear constellation that turns around itself and carries the whole cosmos with it—who owns this instrument? Who set the boundaries of the sea? Who placed the earth in its position? Tat, there is someone who is the Maker and Lord of all these things. It is impossible for number, place, and measure to exist without someone to create them.No order whatsoever can be made by something that lacks place and measure; even this, my son, is not without a lord. If the disorderly lacks something, because it is not the master of the path of order, it is beneath a lord—the one who has not yet brought it into order.

If only it were possible for you to grow wings, soar into the air, and, suspended between earth and heaven, observe the solidity of the earth, the fluidity of the sea (the flow of its streams), the vastness of the air, the swiftness of fire, and the movement of the stars, and the swiftness of the heavens' rotation around them! It would be a most blessed sight, my son, to see all these under one control—the unmoving in motion, and the unseen made visible; by which this order of the cosmos and the cosmos itself are made visible.

If you want to see Him through mortal things, both on land and in the sea, think of a man's formation in the womb, my son, and closely examine the work of Him who forms him, and learn who creates this fair and divine image of Man.

Who then is He who defines the circles of the eyes; who bores out the nostrils and the ears; who opens the mouth; who stretches and ties the nerves; who carves out the veins; who hardens the bones; who covers the flesh with skin; who separates the fingers and joints; who broadens the feet for walking; who digs out the ducts; who spreads out the spleen; who shapes the heart like a pyramid; who sets the ribs together; who enlarges the liver; who makes the lungs like a sponge; who stretches the belly so much; who makes the most honorable parts prominent so they may be seen, while hiding from sight those of least honor?Observe how many skills are applied to one material, how much effort goes into a single design; all are incredibly beautiful, perfectly balanced, yet each is unique! Who created them all? What mother or father, except God alone, who made everything by His Will? And no one says a statue or a picture comes into being without a sculptor or a painter; so how can such remarkable work exist without a Creator? What profound blindness, impiety, and ignorance!

Therefore, son Tat, never deny the existence of a Creator behind these works! He is greater than any name, for He is the Father of all. Truly, He is the Only One, and this is His nature: to be a father. So, if I may speak boldly, His essence is to conceive and create all things.

Just as nothing can exist without its maker, He cannot exist unless He is always creating everything—in heaven, in the air, on earth, in the depths, in the entire cosmos, and in every part of everything. For there is nothing in the world that is not a part of Him. He is Himself both what exists and what does not exist. The things that exist He has made visible, and He holds the things that do not exist within Himself.

He is the God beyond all names; the unmanifest and the most manifest; the one the mind alone can contemplate, and the one visible to the eyes as well; the one without a body, and the one with many bodies—in fact, He is in every body. There is nothing that He is not. For everything is part of Him, and He is everything. This is why He has all names, because they all belong to one Father. And this is why He has no specific name, because He is the Father of all.

Who, then, can sing praises to You, or about You? Where should I turn my eyes to sing Your praise; above, below, within, or outside?There is no place or thing apart from You. Everything exists within You and comes from You, O You who gives all and takes nothing, for You have everything and lack nothing. 

When, Father, shall I praise You? No one can determine Your time. What should I praise You for? The things You have made or the things You have not? The things You have revealed or the things You have hidden? How should I praise You? As being myself? As having something of my own? As being different? For You are whatever I may be; You are whatever I may do; You are whatever I may speak. For You are everything, and there is nothing You are not. You are all that exists, and You are what does not exist—Mind when You think, Father when You create, and God when You act, and Good and Creator of all things. 

For the subtler part of matter is air, of air is soul, of soul is mind, and of mind is God.### Commentary

#### The Title

The compiler of our collection likely took this sermon from a set known as "Those to Tat," since it begins with "kai tonde soi ton logon," implying there was at least one preceding sermon. It's unclear if the preceding sermon was "The Cup" (C.H. iv. (v.)) or the lost "The General Sermon" (C.H. ii.). This sermon doesn't have its own proper title; the subject stated in place of a title comes from the second sentence of the text and was likely added by a later Byzantine editor.

#### Maya

The initial paragraphs of this profound text are challenging to translate into English while maintaining the nuances of the Greek language. Previous translators have missed this subtle word-play, so I've attempted to capture it using the somewhat awkward term "manifest." The Greek word-play can be seen from the following list of original terms in order of their occurrence: afanes, fanerōtaton, emfanes, fainomenon, efane, afanes, faneinai, fanera, afanēs, fanerun, faneroutai, fantasiai, fantasiun, fantasia, afantasiastos kai afanēs, fantasiun, fainetai, faneinai. These terms all appear in section 1 and the first two lines of section 2. I have translated fantasia as "thinking-manifest," which represents the power that makes an object apparent or manifest. This concept aligns with the Vedanta philosophy's doctrine of Maya. Maya is commonly translated as "illusion," but this isn't accurate, as it originates from the root ma, meaning to make or measure. In Vedanta, the Logos is called Mayin (masculine), the Maker or Creator, and His Power, or Shakti, is Maya (feminine).The Divine Thought is powerful and, far from being any ordinary illusion, is very real to us. It is only unreal when compared to the Logos Himself, the ultimate reality in the highest philosophical sense. This idea is beautifully summarized by Phosilampes, as quoted in the Untitled Apocalypse of the Codex Brucianus:

"Through Him exists what truly is and what truly is not, through which the Hidden that truly is and the Manifest that truly is not exist." Also, consider Hippolytus' summary of the "Simonian" Gnosis:

"Of this Twofold Nature, he calls one side the Hidden and the other the Manifest, saying that the hidden parts of the Fire are concealed in the visible, and the visible is produced by the hidden.

"The visible side of the Fire contains everything a person can notice in the visible world, or unconsciously fails to notice. The hidden side includes everything we can understand as intelligible, or fail to understand."

2. "The Lord does not withhold Himself from anything." Compare this with Corpus Hermeticum, iv. (v.) 3: "He does not begrudge anyone, for begrudging does not come from Him"; and compare both with Plato's Timaeus (29 E): "He was Good, and to the Good, there can never be any begrudging of anything."

THE HIGHER PANTHEISM OR PANMONISM

10. The soul-satisfying pantheism of section 10 can be compared to the address to the Logos in The Martyrdom of Peter, which retains many Gnostic elements: "You, who can only be understood by spirit alone! You are my father, my mother, my brother, my friend, my servant, and my master. You are everything, and everything is in You. Yes, all that exists is You; and there is nothing else but You alone!"### Hymn to All-God

The treatise concludes with an extraordinary Hymn to God, considered one of the most magnificent ever written. Unfortunately, a foolish copyist spoiled it by adding a marginal note from a reader into the main text. 

Compare the sentence: "All are in Thee, all are from Thee," with the Naassene Hymn (quoted in Hippolytus' Introduction in "The Myth of Man"):

"'From Thee' is Father, and 'Through Thee' is Mother--the two Immortal Names, Parents of Aeons, O Thou who hast the Heaven for Thy City, O Man of Mighty Names!"

### Corpus Hermeticum VI. (VII.) In God Alone is Good and Nowhere Else

1. Good, Asclepius, exists only in God. In fact, Good is God Himself, eternally. If this is true, Good must be an essence free from all kinds of motion and change (though nothing is free from Good). It has stable energy, never too little or too much, always in full supply. Though it is one, it is the source of everything, because what provides everything is Good. When I say it provides everything, it is always Good. This quality belongs only to God. He needs nothing, so He cannot be bad by desiring anything. He cannot lose anything, so He cannot feel pain because pain is part of badness.

Nothing is superior to Him to dominate Him; nothing is equal to Him to harm Him or make Him fall in love; nothing ignores Him to make Him angry; and nothing is wiser than Him to make Him envious.Since all these negative qualities are absent in His being, what remains but Good alone? Just as no evil can be found in such a transcendent Being, Good cannot be found in any of the others. All other things, whether small or great, contain all these negative qualities—both individually and in the larger, mightier living beings. Things that are born are full of passions because birth itself is subject to change and suffering. Where there is passion, there is no Good; and where there is Good, there is no passion. Just as day and night cannot coexist, Good cannot exist in things that are born, but only in the eternal. However, since matter shares in all things, it also shares in Good.

This makes the Cosmos good in that it creates all things, so in its act of creation, it is Good. But in all other aspects, it is not Good because it is subject to change and creates things that are also subject to change. In humans, good is determined by the absence of greater evil; what is not too bad is considered good, and what is considered good is just the least part of bad. Therefore, good here cannot be free of bad, as good here is tainted by bad. When tainted, it ceases to be good and becomes bad. Only in God is there pure Good, or rather, Good is God Himself. Thus, Asclepius, the name of Good is found among men, but the true essence of Good is not, as it is impossible. No material body can contain Good, as it is surrounded by bad qualities, labor, pain, desires, passions, error, and foolish thoughts. The greatest evil, Asclepius, is that what is considered the greatest good here is actually filled with these negative qualities.And what is an even greater evil is gluttony, the error that leads to all other evils—it makes us turn away from Goodness. I, for my part, thank God for giving me the knowledge that true Goodness cannot exist in this world, because the world is full of evil, but God is full of Goodness, and Goodness comes from God. The qualities of Beauty surround the essence of Goodness, and they seem so pure and untainted that they might actually be its essence. One might even say, Asclepius, if God has an essence, it is Beauty; and Beauty is also Goodness. No Goodness can come from worldly objects, for all things we see are mere images and representations, while the real things, especially the essence of Beauty and Goodness, are beyond our sight. Just as the eye cannot see God, it cannot behold Beauty and Goodness. They are integral parts of God, inseparable and beloved, with whom God is in love, or they are in love with God.

If you can conceive of God, you can conceive of Beauty and Goodness, which transcend Light and are made even lighter by God. That Beauty is beyond comparison, and that Goodness is unmatched, just as God is. As you conceive of God, conceive of Beauty and Goodness, for they cannot be joined with anything else in the world since they are inseparable from God. If you seek God, you seek Beauty. There is only one path to It—Devotion combined with Knowledge.Here is the simplified and modernized version of the text:

---

People who are not familiar with or do not follow the path of devotion often dare to call a person beautiful and good, even though they have never truly seen anything good. They are surrounded by all kinds of bad things and mistakenly believe these bad things are good. They constantly use these bad things and even fear losing them, so they work hard to keep and increase them. These are the things people call good and beautiful, Asclepius—things we cannot avoid or hate. The hardest part is that we need them and cannot live without them.

COMMENTARY

THE TITLE

This sermon, which has no proper title but has been given one by an editor based on the opening sentence, belongs to the Asclepius group. Reitzenstein suggests that this text and the previous Asclepius-Dialogue might have been part of the same collection. DUALISM? The teaching of this sermon appears dualistic, but perhaps only in form, intended to elevate the student's thoughts beyond what he is accustomed to. At the end, Hermes says:

"Such are the things that men call good and beautiful, Asclepius—things which we cannot avoid or hate. The hardest part is that we need them and cannot live without them." This shows a clear advancement from the earlier teaching about "hating" the body in C. H., iv.

Thrice-Greatest Hermes, Vol. 2, by G.R.S. Mead, [1906], at sacred-texts.com

[p. 115]The text discusses the differing views on the nature of the cosmos within the Trismegistic tradition. Despite a clear statement in section 4 that "the world is full of evil," another treatise by Hermes to Asclepius contradicts this, stating "evil's place is on earth, not the world, as some blasphemers say." This contradiction suggests that the cosmos is not inherently evil but a beautiful order, with evil being an earthly matter. The disagreement indicates diverse schools of thought within the tradition, possibly leading to theological disputes. It is also suggested that Hermes might have used metaphorical language to emphasize the ideal of Good, which was later taken literally. Hermes would have known that the cosmos was seen as the Son of God, the fairest and most beloved. Additionally, in the Trismegistic doctrine, the "cosmic man" opposed the "essential man," with "cosmic" being used in both theological and philosophical contexts, similar to its use in Christianity.Many examples can be found in the New Testament documents, and we have a notable example of the use of "cosmos" in this sense in the second saying of the First Oxyrhynchus Fragment:

"Jesus says: Unless you fast from the world (ton kosmon), you will not find the Kingdom of God." Since we do not find any other mention of a "pleroma of evil," we can reasonably conclude that it is meant metaphorically here.

GOD AS THE FULLNESS OF GOOD

"God is the Fullness of Good, and Good is the Fullness of God." Speaking of the Triumphant Christ as the Cosmic Logos, Paul writes:

"And God has made Him (Christ) the Head over all things for the Church, which is His Body—the Fullness (Pleroma) of Him who fills all things in every way."

The concept of the "Church" as the Pleroma can be illustrated by Philo in his work, "De Proem. et Poen.," section xi:

"And thus the soul, becoming a Fullness of virtues through the three best blessings—nature, instruction, and practice—leaving no empty space for anything else, brings forth a perfect number—her two sets of six sons, a small representation of the circle of life’s types, for the betterment of earthly matters. This is the House that nothing can harm, perfect and continuous in both public scriptures and the secret meanings of the mystics—the House that gained the prize of leadership over its own tribes. It was from this House, as it grew and became populous, that well-organized cities were established, and disciplines of wisdom, righteousness, and holiness were pursued, worthy of such a high purpose."In the Trismegistic tradition, the concept is simpler, as shown in "The Definitions of Asclepius," C. H. (xvi.) 3:

"The Fullness of all things is One and is within One. This One is not a second entity but is both One and the same. If someone tries to separate what seems to be both All and One from One, they will misunderstand 'All' as a multitude instead of fullness, which is impossible. If they replace All with One, they will destroy the concept of All."

However, the Fullness (Pleroma) of Life is specifically the Cosmos as the Son of God, or the Logos. As stated in C. H., xii. (xiii.) 15:

"Matter is one, and the Cosmos as a whole is the Mighty God and the Image of the Mightier One, unified with Him, preserving the Will and Order of the Father, and is Life's Fullness. How then, my son, could there be dead things in God, the Image of the Father, the Fullness of Life?" And in C. H., ix. (x.) 7:

"For the Cosmos, being a wise Breath, grants qualities to bodies along with the Fullness of Life."

This Fullness of God is the Good and Beautiful. The path to this True Good is one of balance, combining Devotion and Knowledge, similar to the Bhakti-Marga and Jnana-Marga in Sanskrit.

Finally, we learn that things are not inherently bad; the problem is that people are satisfied with their small gains and cling to them, not realizing the greater blessings available if they open their spiritual eyes to the True Vision of the Good. Even the beautiful psychic visions of the soul do not compare to the Most Blessed Sight of All.

**CORPUS HERMETICUM VII. (VIII.) THE GREATEST ILL AMONG MEN IS IGNORANCE OF GOD**

**Text: P. 54, 55; Pat. 18a.**

1. Where are you stumbling, you who are drunk on the pure wine of ignorance, and can't even hold it down, already vomiting it out? Stop, be sober, and look upwards with the true eyes of your heart! Even if not all of you can do this, at least those who can should try! Ignorance spreads over the earth and overwhelms the soul trapped within the body, stopping it from reaching the harbors of Salvation.

2. Don’t get swept away by the fierce flood. Use the shore-current if you can, and aim for Salvation's port. Once you’re there, seek someone to guide you to the gates of Gnosis. 

[p. 121]

Here, clear Light shines free of any darkness; where no soul is drunk, but all look soberly with their hearts' eyes at Him who wishes to be seen. No ear can hear Him, nor eye see Him, nor tongue speak of Him, but only mind and heart. But first, you must remove the cloak you wear—the web of ignorance, the root of evil, the chain of corruption, the shell of darkness, the living death, the corpse of sensation, the tomb you carry with you, the thief in your house, who through the things he loves, hates you, and through the things he hates, bears you malice.Your hateful cloak strangles you and keeps you from looking up. It prevents you from seeing the beauty of truth and goodness, making you detest the bad. This cloak has conspired against you by dulling your senses, filling you with loathsome desires so that you cannot hear or see what you should. 

COMMENTARY

A PREACHING

This powerful appeal urges us to stop being intoxicated by physical sensations and to awaken to the Light. Reitzenstein calls it a "prophetic sermon" and notes that it is not directly attributed to Hermes in any manuscripts, meaning it has no other title than the descriptive sentence at its beginning. The style and spirit are reminiscent not of C. H. iii. (iv.), as Reitzenstein suggests, but of the added passages in the "Poemandres" treatise (section 27):

"O earthborn people, who have given yourselves to drunkenness, sleep, and ignorance, be sober now, stop overindulging, and wake from your irrational sleep!" 

Did this sentence inspire our sermon? Or is the sentence a summary of the preaching? Or do both come from a common source?### The Probable Completion of an Oxyrhynchus Saying

The last hypothesis seems to be the most satisfactory choice. We can compare this to a familiar figure of speech found in Logion 3 of the First Oxyrhynchus Fragment:

"Jesus said: I stood in the midst of the world, and I appeared to them in the flesh. I found all men drunk, and none were thirsty among them; my soul grieves over the souls of men because they are blind in their hearts and cannot see..." Can we deduce the missing word from our sermon? "But sober, they all gaze with their hearts' eyes on Him who wishes to be seen." The missing word seems to be "God." The Gospel that is preached is the Beauty of the Gnosis—"the Beauty of the Truth and Good that dwells within." Just as it is mentioned in Corpus Hermeticum, i. 27:

"And I began to preach to men the Beauty of Devotion and of the Gnosis." Those struggling in the Sea of Ignorance are to head towards the Harbor of Salvation—clearly a significant organization devoted to the holy life. There, they must seek someone knowledgeable, who can guide them to the Gates of Gnosis. This suggests the organization had a general body with different levels of instruction; many were striving for enlightenment, while a few had already achieved it.

### Corpus Hermeticum VIII. (IX.) That No Existing Thing Perishes, But Men Mistakenly Speak of Changes as Destruction and Death

[Of Hermes to Tat]

(Text: P. 56-59; Pat. 48a, 48b.) 1. [Hermes.] Concerning Soul and Body, son, we must now speak; how the Soul is immortal, and where the activity in composing and dissolving the Body comes from.There is no death for anything that exists. The concept of "death" is either incorrect or, by simply changing a syllable, "death" becomes "deathless."

Death implies destruction, and nothing in the universe is destroyed. If the universe is a secondary god, an eternal life, then no part of this immortal life can die. Everything in the universe is a part of the universe, especially humans, who are rational beings.

First of all, God, the creator of everything, is eternal and beyond birth. Second, there is the universe, created in God's image, sustained and nourished by Him, and made immortal by its creator, living forever, free from death. What lives forever is different from the Eternal; for the Eternal has not been created by another, and even if it were created, it has not been brought into being by itself but is always becoming. The Eternal is everything because it is eternal. The Father is eternal by Himself, but the universe has become eternal and immortal through the Father.

The Father made a universal body from the matter stored beneath it, shaping it into a sphere and wrapping it around life, making it immortal and giving materiality an eternal nature. 

The Father, filled with His ideas, implanted life into the sphere, enclosing it like in a cave, intending to organize life with every type of living being. He enclosed the universal body with immortality so that matter would not wish to separate from the body's composition and dissolve into its original chaos. For matter, before it was formed, was chaotic. It still retains this chaotic nature here on Earth, enveloping the smaller lives, which increase and decrease, a process humans call death.The disorder exists around earthly lives. The heavenly bodies follow an order given to them by the Father, and they maintain this order through their restoration.

The restoration of bodies on Earth means their composition, while their dissolution returns them to bodies that cannot be dissolved and do not know death. So, the loss of senses happens, not the loss of bodies.

The third life—human life, made in the image of the Cosmos and possessing a mind according to the Father's will—is above all earthly lives. It not only connects with the second God but also conceives the first God; it senses the second as a body and conceives the first as the bodiless Good Mind.

Tat asks if this life does not perish. Hermes responds, urging understanding of what God, the Cosmos, and the difference between an immortal life and a life subject to dissolution are. The Cosmos exists by and within God, while humans exist by and within the Cosmos. God is the source, limit, and constitution of all things.### Commentary

#### The Cosmos as "Second God"

The title indicates the theme of the treatise, apparently derived from the Dialogues to Tat, and originally part of a general dissertation or a collection of essays. This instruction describes the Cosmos as the "Second God," similar to Philo's teachings. However, just as Philo avoids suggesting duality, our treatise concludes with the words:

"The source, limit, and structure of everything is God." The Cosmos, seen as the Great Body or Sphere, is the root of all forms and is framed by the idea of Eternity or Deathlessness. It is like the womb of all things in creation, centered in the Pleroma of ideas—the Intelligible Cosmos, filled with God's ideas.

#### The Law of Apokatastasis

The eternal order and life of the Cosmos are maintained by the law of apokatastasis, or restoration, which refers to the cyclical return and renewal of everything. This is the process of continual becoming and renewal. There is no actual loss of body, only a temporary loss of sense or a dormant phase of consciousness. There are three Great Lives: God, Cosmos, and Man. Cosmos is created in the image of God, and Man is created in the image of Cosmos. Therefore, Man has both sense and mind. Through his senses, he is connected to the Cosmos, and through his mind, he is conscious of God, who is bodiless.As we might say, through the senses, humans understand the physical world, and through the mind, they understand the intellectual world—the Good Mind. For God is the Source, Limit, and Structure of everything, including both the intellectual and physical worlds.

**CORPUS HERMETICUM IX (X): ON THOUGHT AND SENSE**

**THAT THE BEAUTIFUL AND GOOD IS ONLY IN GOD AND NOWHERE ELSE**

1. Yesterday, Asclepius, I delivered the Perfect Sermon (Logos). Today, I think it appropriate to review the Sermon about Sense point by point. Sense and thought seem to differ because sense deals with matter while thought deals with substance. However, to me, they appear unified in humans. In other beings, sense aligns with nature, but in humans, it aligns with thought. Mind differs as much from thought as God differs from divinity. Divinity comes from God, and thought comes from the mind, which is the sister of the word (logos) and its instrument. The word cannot be expressed without thought, and thought is not revealed without the word.

2. Sense and thought merge in humans, intertwined with each other. One cannot think without sensing, nor sense without thinking. It is possible, some say, to think without sensing, as in dreams. However, I believe both activities occur in dream visions, and sense transitions from sleep to wakefulness. Humans are divided into soul and body, and only when both aspects of sense harmonize can the mind express its conceived thoughts.

3.The mind conceives all thoughts. Good thoughts come from receiving seeds from God, while bad thoughts come from receiving seeds from evil spirits. No part of the universe is free from these spirits; they sneak into those illuminated by God's light and plant seeds of their own energy. The mind then conceives these seeds, resulting in actions like adultery, murder, parricide, sacrilege, impiety, strangling, and pushing people off cliffs—actions driven by evil spirits.

God's seeds are few but vast, beautiful, and good, leading to virtue, self-control, and devotion. Devotion means knowing God, and those who know God, filled with all good things, think godly thoughts, unlike the majority. For this reason, those with Godly knowledge do not please the majority, nor do the majority please them. They are considered mad, laughed at, hated, despised, and sometimes even killed. We said that evil must exist on earth, where it belongs, not in the cosmos as some wrongly claim. A devotee of God endures everything once they have gained knowledge. For such a person, even bad things are good because they refer everything to their understanding. Amazingly, they alone can turn bad things into good.

Returning to the discussion on sense: Sense, combined with thought, makes a person human. However, not every person benefits from thought. Some people are materialistic, while others are substantial. The materialistic person, associating with evil, gets their thoughts from evil spirits, while substantial people, associating with the Good, are saved by God.God is the Creator of everything, and in His creation, He ultimately makes everything resemble Himself. However, as things develop and improve through their activities, they start off as unproductive. It is the movement of the universe that shapes their development, sometimes tarnishing them with bad and other times refining them with good. The universe, Asclepius, has its own unique sense and thought, different from that of humans; it is simpler and better.

The universe's single purpose is to create all things and eventually return them to itself, acting as an instrument of God's Will. It is organized in such a way that it receives all seeds from God, holds them within, brings them into existence, and then dissolves them to renew them again. Like a Good Gardener of Life, it takes what has been dissolved and renews it. It gives life to everything, making them live and being both the Place of Life and its Creator.

Physical bodies are diverse. Some are made of earth, some of water, some of air, and some of fire. They are all composed differently; some are more complex, while others are simpler. Heavier bodies are more complex, lighter ones less so. The rapid movement of the universe determines the variety of births, as it imparts qualities to bodies along with the essence of Life.

God is the Father of the Universe, and the Universe is the father of everything within it. The Universe is God's Son, and everything within the Universe comes from the Universe. It is rightly called "Cosmos" (Order) because it organizes everything with their diverse origins, gives life to all, operates tirelessly, moves swiftly out of necessity, and composes elements and creatures in an orderly manner.The same, then, should necessarily and properly be called Order. The sense and thought of all living beings come to them from outside, breathed into them by what contains them all; whereas the Cosmos receives them once and keeps them as a gift from God.

But God is not beyond the reach of sense and thought, as some believe. Such claims are made out of superstition. For all things, Asclepius, exist in God, are created by God, and depend on Him—whether they act through bodies, through soul substance, give life through spirit, or take in things that are worn out. Rightly so; in fact, I would say that He does not possess these things, but rather, He is all of them. He does not receive them from outside but gives them from Himself. This is God's sense and thought: to always move all things. There will never be a time when any part of what exists will cease; and by "any part of what exists," I mean any part of God. For what exists, God possesses; there is nothing without Him, nor is He without anything.

These things should seem true to you, Asclepius, if you understand them; but if you do not understand, they will seem unbelievable. To understand is to believe, and to not believe is to not understand. My word leads you to the truth. But the mind is powerful, and when led by words to a certain point, it has the power to reach the truth on its own. By contemplating all these things and finding them consistent with what reason has already translated, it has believed and found rest in that Fair Faith.For those who understand what has been discussed above with God's help, it is believable; for those who do not understand, it is unbelievable. This should be enough about thought and sense.

COMMENTARY

TITLE AND ORDERING

This treatise has a dual title: "On Thought and Sense," and "That the Beautiful and Good is in God only."The previous heading clearly comes from the concluding words: "Let so much then suffice on thought-and-sense," while the introductory sentence only mentions the Sermon on Sense. The latter heading appears to be an accidental repetition of the title of C. H., vi. (vii.). The opening words: "I gave the Perfect Sermon yesterday, Asclepius," tell us not only that this is an Asclepius Dialogue but also that it follows directly after the "Perfect Sermon," a Latin version of which has fortunately been preserved for us.

Therefore, it is very interesting to note that Lactantius, when quoting a sentence from our treatise (section 4)—"Devotion is God-gnosis"—continues with: "Asclepius, his listener, has also explained the same idea in greater detail in the Perfect Sermon."

Lactantius had a collection where these two sermons were closely connected. Reitzenstein believes that our sermon must be an excerpt from a longer one because he finds it hard to believe that such a short treatise could be immediately connected (as the opening words suggest) with such a lengthy and detailed work as the "Perfect Sermon." This may be true; however, the formal beginning and ending of our sermon suggest that it is a complete tractate and not an excerpt.

"SENSE-AND-THOUGHT"

The idea that in humans "sense-and-thought" together make up human "sense" provides some insight into the term "sense" as used elsewhere in Trismegistic literature, where we might expect to find "mind" instead, especially in the sense of the higher mind. Normal human "thought" is entirely bound up in sense impressions; only the mind can rise above the senses, as it alone can be "illumined by God's Light" (section 3).The mind can be influenced either by divine inspiration or by negative forces, leading to the formation of virtues or vices. This idea is similar to what Philo teaches, as discussed in the "Prolegomena" about the "Sacred Marriage."

The Seeds of God represent virtues like self-control, devotion, and true piety, which is essentially the knowledge of God. The Gnostics, those who possess this knowledge, are often misunderstood and rejected by society. They are considered mad, laughed at, hated, and sometimes even killed. This highlights the conflict between the enlightened few and the ignorant majority.

This notion is reflected in the biblical sayings:
"Blessed are you when people hate you, exclude you, insult you, and reject your name as evil because of the Son of Man" (Luke 6:22).
"Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me" (Matthew 5:11).

It seems to me that Luke's version is closer to the original message, which was addressed to those who were rejected by their community for their direct connection with divine inspiration, disregarding the biases of the majority. In contrast, Matthew's version appears to be adapted for broader use within the Jesus movement.THE TRUE GNOSTIC

The true "Gnostic," or the person who is actively growing to be like Christ, is praised for being patient with everything, as he starts to understand the reasons behind things. For such a person, even things that seem bad to others are good because he views them through his knowledge. He sees the good and God in all things and is like an Alchemist, transforming bad things into good through spiritual means. He takes the bitterness of life and turns it into something pure and life-giving. In every person, there are two aspects: the material (physical) and the substantial (spiritual). Evil is not permanent; it is just part of the process of becoming good.

THE GOAL OF GNOSIS

Translating the original delicate wording is challenging. God's ultimate goal is to make everything like Himself, with the world eventually reaching a state of unity with Him. During this process, imperfections cannot create on their own; they are unproductive. The tool for God's creation is the Cosmic Course. Differences in bodies are due to the speed of this Cosmic Course, with both opposites ultimately being part of the Cosmos, which resembles God. The goal is to develop a unified "sense-and-thought" of the Cosmos, which is simple rather than complex. This involves working deliberately with God's Will, constantly renewing all things.The Universe, as the expression of God, is the nurturing force of life; it is both the place where life exists and its creator—both female and male, both Mother and Father.

THE POSSIBILITY OF KNOWING GOD

The Universe is not separate from God, nor is it contained within God; God does not own the Universe as a possession but is the Universe and everything in it (section 9). The Universe is the Son of God, His very essence (section 8). Therefore, we can understand some aspects of God through our senses and thoughts because "God is not beyond the reach of sense and thought" (anaisthetos kai anoetos); meaning, God does not completely transcend sense and thought, for God is everything. This likely refers again to the critics mentioned in section 4 who advocate a seemingly dualistic doctrine presented in C. H., vi. (vii.).

Finally, we learn that true Faith is a certainty of the mind or true understanding. "To understand is to believe" (section 10). Knowledge, not mere belief, is true Faith. Compare this with the "Perfect Sermon," x. 1:

"I want you, Asclepius, to grasp this reason not only with the keen attention of your soul but also with its living power. For it is a reason that most people cannot believe; the Perfect and the True are understood by more enlightened minds."

CORPUS HERMETICUM X. (XI.) THE KEY

OF THRICE-GREATEST HERMES

(Text: P. 67-84; Pat. 9b-12.)

1. Hermes: Yesterday, Asclepius, I spoke to you, and today it is only right I speak to Tat. This is fitting because today’s talk summarizes the General Sermons addressed to him. "God, Father, and the Good," Tat, has the same essence, or more precisely, energy. For nature denotes growth and is used for things that change, whether they are moving or still, human or divine, all of which He brings into being.

But energy is something different, as we have shown when discussing both divine and human matters. We should remember this when talking about the Good.

2. God's energy is His Will; His essence is to will the existence of all things. What is "God and Father and the Good" but the source of all that is yet to be? Indeed, the very existence of everything that is. This is God, this is the Father, this is the Good; nothing else can be added to Him. Even though the Cosmos, especially the Sun, is also a father to those who partake in it, it is not the cause of their goodness or even their life. Thus, even if the Sun is a father, it is entirely by the will of the Good, without which nothing could exist or come into being.

3. Moreover, parents are the cause of their children, on both the father's and the mother's side, only by sharing in the Good’s desire, which flows through the Sun. It is the Good that creates all things.No one else can have such power except for Him who needs nothing and desires everything to exist. I won't say "creates" because a creator has limitations; sometimes creating and sometimes not, and varying in quality and quantity. But "God, Father, and the Good" is the cause of all existence. This is evident to those who can see.

God wills things to be, and He is the reason for everything else. The unique quality of the Good is that it should be known. This is the Good, Tat. Father, you have filled us with such a beautiful vision that my mind now almost worships it. Unlike the sun's blinding rays, the Vision of the Good enhances our sight, allowing us to see more clearly as long as we can handle its radiance. It reaches us swiftly, does no harm, and is full of immortal life.

Those who can perceive more of this Vision often fall into a deep, almost divine, contemplation, like Uranus and Cronus, our ancestors. May we experience this too, father! Her. Yes, my son, may it be so! But for now, we are not yet ready for this Vision. We lack the ability to fully open our mind's eye and see the pure Beauty of the Good, which is incorruptible and beyond understanding. You will only be able to gaze upon it when you can say nothing about it. True knowledge of the Good comes with holy silence and a rest from all senses.When someone perceives It, they can perceive nothing else; nor can they see, hear, or move their body in any way. They remain completely still. When It illuminates their mind, it shines through their entire soul, drawing it out of the body and transforming them into pure essence. My son, it is possible for a person's soul to become like God while still in a body, if it contemplates the Beauty of the Good.

Tat: Like God! What do you mean, Father?
Her: Every soul undergoes transformations, son.
Tat: What do you mean by 'transformations'?
Her: Haven't you heard in the General Sermons that from the One Soul—the All-soul—come all these souls that move through the cosmos, as if divided off? These souls undergo many changes, some to a happier state and some to the opposite. Some souls that were once creeping creatures become beings that live in the water, water beings become earth dwellers, earth dwellers become winged creatures, and air dwellers become humans. Human souls, in turn, can become daimones—the first step towards immortality. They then join the choir of the Inerrant Gods; there are two choirs of Gods: the Inerrant and the Errant. This is the highest glory of the soul.

However, if a soul in a human body continues in its vice, it neither tastes immortality nor shares in the Good. Instead, it returns to the path of becoming a creeping thing again. This is the fate of the vicious soul. And the soul's vice is ignorance. A soul without knowledge of the true nature of things or the Good is blinded by the body's passions and tossed about.This unfortunate soul, unaware of her true nature, becomes a slave to various bodies, carrying the body as a burden rather than ruling it. This ignorance is the soul's flaw. However, the soul's virtue is knowledge. The one who possesses knowledge is good and virtuous, and even while on Earth, he is divine.

Tat asks, "But who is such a person, my father?"

Hermes replies, "It is someone who does not speak much or listen to many arguments. Engaging in endless debates is like fighting shadows because God, the Father and the Good, cannot be reached through speech or hearing. 

Although every being has senses, they cannot exist without them. However, knowledge is different from sense. Sense is influenced by what dominates us, while knowledge is the culmination of understanding, a gift from God. 

All knowledge is incorporeal, using the mind as its tool, just as the mind uses the body. Both types of things—those understood by the mind alone and those material—exist within bodies. Everything must consist of opposites and contrasts; it cannot be otherwise.

Tat asks, "Who is this material God you speak of?"

Hermes responds, "The Cosmos is beautiful but not inherently good because it is material and subject to change. Although it is the foremost of all things that can change, it is still secondary in existence and lacks completeness. It is eternal but constantly becoming, generating various qualities and quantities since it is in motion, and all material motion originates from this.

It is the stable, intelligible aspect that drives material motion because the Cosmos is like a sphere or a head. Nothing above the head is material, and nothing below the feet is intelligible; it is all material."The head moves in a spherical way, as it should, and represents the mind. All things connected to the essence of this head, which is the soul, are naturally free from death. These things have a greater proportion of soul compared to the body. Conversely, things farther from this essence, which have more body than soul, are subject to death by nature. The entirety of existence is life, comprising both physical and intelligible elements.

The Cosmos is the first living thing, while man is second, though man is the first among mortal beings. Man possesses the same life force as other living things but is considered evil because he is mortal.

The Cosmos is not good because it undergoes motion, but it is not evil because it is not subject to death. Man, however, is evil because he is subject to both motion and death.

Man's principles are organized as follows: mind within reason (logos), reason within the soul, soul within the spirit, and spirit within the body. The spirit, through veins, arteries, and blood, provides the body with motion and sustains it. Some people mistakenly believe the soul is blood, not understanding that at death, the spirit first withdraws into the soul, causing the blood to congeal and the veins and arteries to empty, leading to the body's death.

All things depend on one Source, which depends on the One and Only. The Source moves to become itself again, while the One remains perpetually unmoved. Thus, there are three: God (the Father and the Good), the Cosmos, and man.God encompasses the universe; the universe contains man. The universe is always God's creation, and man is like the child of the universe. However, this doesn't mean that God ignores man; on the contrary, He knows man well and wishes to be known. The only salvation for man is knowledge of God. This is the path to enlightenment.

Through God alone, the soul becomes good—not sometimes good and sometimes evil, but necessarily good. 

Tat: What do you mean, Thrice-Greatest One?

Hermes: Look at an infant's soul, my son, which is not yet separated, because its body is still small and not fully grown.

Tat: How?

Hermes: Such a soul is a beautiful thing to see, not yet tainted by the body's desires, still almost connected to the Cosmic Soul. But when the body grows and weighs down the soul with its mass, the soul separates itself and falls into forgetfulness, no longer partaking in the Beautiful and Good. This forgetfulness leads to vice.

It is the same for those who leave their bodies. When the soul withdraws into itself, the spirit contracts within the blood, and the soul within the spirit. Then the mind, stripped of its coverings and naturally divine, takes on a fiery body and travels through all spaces, leaving the soul to face its judgment and deserved consequences.

Tat: What do you mean by this, father? The mind is separated from the soul, and the soul from the spirit? But you said that the soul was the mind's covering, and the spirit was the soul's covering.

Hermes: The listener, my son, should think along with the speaker and understand deeply; he should be more perceptive than the speaker's voice. In an earthly body, this arrangement of coverings occurs. For in an earthly body, it is not possible for the mind to exist in its pure form by itself.It is not possible for an earthly body to contain immortality, nor for such a great virtue to endure a mortal body in close contact. Therefore, the soul acts as an envelope for the body. The divine soul uses the spirit as its envelope, and the spirit permeates the living creature.

When the mind frees itself from the earthly body, it immediately takes on its proper robe of fire, which it couldn't wear in an earthly body. Earth cannot bear fire; even a small spark can set it ablaze. That's why water surrounds the earth, acting as a guard to keep the fire away. The mind, being the fastest of all divine thoughts and faster than all elements, has fire as its body. The mind uses fire as a tool to construct all things—the universal Mind for everything, and the human mind for earthly things. Without fire, the earthly mind cannot create divine things, as it is limited to human capabilities.

The soul in humans—specifically, a pious soul—is something divine and daimonic. When freed from the body, if it has lived piously (knowing God and doing no harm to others), it becomes entirely mind. An impious soul, however, remains in its essence, punished by itself, seeking another earthly body to enter, preferably human. No other body can contain a human soul, and it is not right for a human soul to enter a non-rational being. God's law protects the human soul from such degradation.

Tat asked, "Father, how is a man's soul punished?" Her replied, "What greater punishment for a human soul is there than a lack of piety?"What fire burns as fiercely as a lack of piety? What ravenous beast harms the body as much as a lack of piety harms the soul? Can't you see the countless troubles an impious soul endures? It cries out in agony: "I burn; I am on fire; I don't know what to say or do; oh, woe is me, I am consumed by all the evils surrounding me; alas, poor me, I can neither see nor hear!" These are the cries of a soul being punished. It's a serious mistake to think, as many do, that a person's soul turns into a beast after leaving the body. This is not true; the way a soul is punished is as follows:

When the mind becomes a spirit, it must take a fiery form to serve God. It enters the most impious soul and punishes it with whips made of its own sins. The impious soul, whipped by its sins, is plunged into murder, outrage, blasphemy, all kinds of violence, and other wrongdoings against humanity.

But the mind guides the pious soul toward the Light of Knowledge. Such a soul never tires of singing praises to God, blessing all people, and doing good in word and deed, imitating its Creator.

Therefore, my son, you should praise God and pray for a good mind. The soul passes to a better state, not a worse one. Moreover, there is interaction among souls: the souls of gods interact with those of men, and the souls of men with those of animals that lack reason. The higher beings care for the lower ones: gods look after men, men look after irrational animals, and God oversees everything. For He is higher than all, and all are beneath Him. The universe is subject to God, man to the universe, and irrational creatures to man. But God is above all and encompasses all.God's rays represent His energies, the Cosmos's rays represent nature's energies, and the arts and sciences represent man's energies.

The energies act through the Cosmos, and from there, through the nature-rays of the Cosmos upon man; the nature-rays act through the elements; man acts through the sciences and arts. This is the order of the universe, originating from the nature of the One, permeating all things through the Mind, which is the most divine and powerful force. It is the greatest means of uniting men to gods and gods to men. The Mind is the Good Spirit. Blessed is the soul that is most filled with Him, and wretched is the soul that is empty of the Mind.

Tat: Father, what do you mean?

Her: Do you think, my son, that every soul has the Good Mind? For we are speaking of the Good Mind, not the mind that serves for discipline. 

For a soul without the mind can neither speak nor act. Often the mind leaves the soul, and at that time the soul neither sees nor understands, becoming like something without reason. Such is the power of the mind. However, it does not stay with a sluggish soul, but leaves it tied to the body and weighed down by it. Such a soul does not have the Mind and should not be called a man. For man is a divine living being; man is not measured with other earthly beings, but with the heavenly beings called gods. In fact, if we dare to speak the truth, the true "man" is even higher than the gods, or at the very least, gods and men are equal in power.No god from heaven can come down to earth, as heaven's boundary cannot be crossed; however, man can ascend to heaven and understand it. He knows what is high and low in heaven and learns everything else about it. The greatest thing of all is that without even leaving the earth, he can rise above it. Man possesses such a vast capacity for wonder.

For this reason, one can say that a man on earth is a god who is subject to death, while a god in heaven is a man who is immune to death. Therefore, the order of all things is managed through these two—Cosmos and Man—by the One.Convert the following text into modern English; correct and simplify the text without altering its original meaning:

COMMENTARY

THE CONCLUSION OF THE "GENERAL SERMONS"

We cannot determine what "yesterday's sermon," which Hermes addressed to Asclepius, was about. The similarity of the phrase with the opening words of C. H., ix. (x.) is noteworthy and suggests there might be a collection of sermons to Asclepius and Tat arranged in chronological order, as delivered daily. If this is true, we must assume such introductions were added by the editor of the collection. "The Key of Thrice-Greatest Hermes" must have been considered a significant document of the school, as we mentioned earlier with "The Cup" treatise, where the apocryphal "Books of Moses" copy the title.

---The treatise was important, as shown by Stobaeus including five extracts from it under the titles "From the [Sermons] of Hermes to Tat" or simply "Of Hermes." Interestingly, in two instances (xxxix. 8 and xl. 3), Stobaeus mistakenly identifies the dialogue participants as Asclepius and Tat, which contradicts his own headings, the nature of the sermon, the editor’s introduction, and Chalcidius, who quotes it as a treatise of Hermes.

Despite its importance, the treatise claims to be a summary of the "General Sermons" addressed to Tat. However, the sermon itself does not seem like a summary; rather, it is one of the most complete and fundamental expositions we have. I suggest that the general and specific references to "The General Sermons" in the introduction were added by the editor of the collection of Asclepius and Tat Sermons. It is a gloss by the editor, not part of the original text. If this argument is correct, "The Key" is not a summary but further teaching that assumes prior instruction from "The General Sermons," providing a deeper exposition of the school's higher doctrine. Reitzenstein (p. 461) believes that the doctrine in Sermons ix. (x.) and x. (xi.) serves as an intermediate stage between the dualism of vi. (vii.) and the pronounced pantheistic mysticism of v. (vi.) and xi. (xii.).I believe that even if these labels are correctly attached, they would not seem as contradictory to the Trismegistic doctors as they do to modern critics. Different points of view and levels of instruction existed; every doctrine held more truth when considered in the proper context. Regardless, this sermon is one of the most beautiful works we have.

**THE WILL OF GOD**

1. Our treatise begins by stating that the universe and everything in it is the result of God's Energy or Effective Working—that is, His Will. This Will is unchanging and constant—the Law of the universe. The subtle way these philosophers used such terms in their inner circles can be seen from the Gnostic Doctor, Basilides, who writes:

"Nothing existed—neither matter, nor substance, nor void, nor simplicity, nor impossibility of composition, nor inconceivability, nor imperceptibility, neither man, nor angel, nor God; in short, nothing at all for which man has ever found a name, nor any operation within the range of his perception or conception.

"Such, or even beyond human comprehension, was the state of Non-Being, when the Deity beyond Being, without thinking, feeling, deciding, choosing, being compelled, or desiring, willed to create everything." "When I use the term will," writes Basilides, "I do so merely to suggest the idea of an operation beyond all volition, thought, or sensible action."

2. God's Energy, or Self-realization, is, therefore, His Will (thelesis); His Essence (oysia) or Substance is "to will the existence of all things"; in short, He is the Very Subsistence (yparxis) of all—a term that later became very important in Platonic philosophy.In section 3, a clear distinction is made between the transcendent idea of God as Creator or Willer and the common view of God as Maker, Fabricator, or Demiurge—a distinction found in nearly every Gnostic system. However, in our treatise, this is not presented as a conflict. It simply states that the self-operation of Deity goes beyond the limited conceptions of a Maker or Fabricator.

OF GNOSIS AND ECSTASIS

4. The key feature of God as the Good, the Desirable, and the Supreme Consummation is "that He should be known" (to gnurizesthai); in other words, the greatest knowledge is the Gnosis of God. 
5. The Vision Glorious, the One Sight, is described as a Ray of Light and Life from the Spiritual Sun shining into the mind. This state of Ecstasis transcends the limitations of the body and was a faculty possessed by the ancestors of Hermes and Tat; these ancestors are symbolically named with Greek names but refer to Egyptian priests from an ancient Nile civilization. It also refers to certain super-men, regarded as gods, who had reached stages of celestial dignity.

Lactantius refers to these ancient Masters of Gnosis in Egypt as follows:

"It appears that Cronus was not born from Heaven (which is impossible), but from a man called Uranus. Trismegistus confirms this, stating that few have possessed perfect science, including Uranus, Cronus, and Hermes."Lactantius seems to be influenced by Euhemerus' theory and does not believe in divine beings, despite the birth of Christ. However, we learn from Lactantius that Hermes mentioned an ancient Hermes along with Uranus and Cronus. In our text, Tat is the speaker, not Hermes. In P.S.A., xxxvii., where Hermes talks about his ancestor Hermes, Uranus and Cronus are not mentioned. Thus, Lactantius refers to a lost work of Hermes.

**On Apotheosis**

6. The nature of ecstasy is further described as the result of meditation or contemplation, the peak of the contemplative life. "The knowledge of the Good is holy silence and a rest for all senses." This holy silence reminds us of the Sige of the Christian Gnostics; here it represents the pure nature within a person, the divine source that brings forth the true self. This can be compared to C. H., xiii. (xiv.) 2:

"Wisdom conceived by mind in silence, such is the matter and the womb from which man is born, and the true Good is the seed." This is akin to the Yoga of the Upanishads, showing the similarity in thought among those who have experienced higher consciousness. "For it is possible, my son, that a man's soul can become like God (apotheutheinai), even while still in a body, if it contemplates the Beauty of the Good." This is the "deification" or "apotheosis" of a person; they become god-like. The Beauty of the Good is the Cosmic Order, and this meditation aligns the soul with the Cosmic Soul.### The Metamorphoses of the Soul

7. The secret of this divine process, known as theurgy, is based on the idea that the soul can transform into any form. The greatest form to emulate is the Cosmic Order, which represents God. Achieving this likeness is the highest transformation of the soul. The individual soul is always on a journey, constantly changing. Many other beliefs, including Egyptian, share this idea. In this context, we can refer to Hippolytus who quotes the Naassene Document:

"They say that the soul is very difficult to discover and understand because it never stays the same in appearance, form, or state, making it hard to define with a general type or essential quality." Hippolytus adds:

"These various changes are described in the Gospel 'According to the Egyptians.'" Most of this Gospel is lost, except for a few fragments, but we know it discussed the soul's transformations. It originated in Egypt and matched Egyptian thinking, indicating that the idea of the soul's transformation was Egyptian.

### The Ladder of Being

The Hermetic belief in the soul's evolution through many transformations includes specific stages: animal, human, daimonic, and god-like. Among the divine beings, there are two types: those who wander and those who do not. The final stage is the soul's ultimate glory or power. This idea closely matches those found in the Pauline Letters. "But someone will ask: How do the dead rise, and with what body do they come back?" "You foolish one!"What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. And what you sow is not the body that will be, but just a bare seed, perhaps of wheat or another grain.

God gives it a body as He wants, and to each kind of seed its own body. Not all flesh is the same: there is one kind for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish. There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the glory of the earthly bodies is another. The glory of the sun is one kind, the glory of the moon is another, and the glory of the stars is yet another; for star differs from star in glory. So too is the resurrection of the dead.

When Paul speaks of the "resurrection of the dead," I believe he means what the learned of the time understood: reaching the first step of immortality, as Hermes describes in our writings. The death or vice of the soul is ignorance, while the virtue or life of the soul is knowledge. "For he who knows is good and pious, and while still on earth, is divine."

Concerning Transmigration

In section 8, however, we face a significant difficulty. Hermes seems to clearly teach that a sinful (ignorant) soul, one that has not attained knowledge, returns to attachment to animal bodies. Yet, in sections 19 and following, he strongly denies that a human soul can do this. Is there any solution to this apparent contradiction within the same treatise?As much as I don't want to come across as defending any scripture, I can't simply dismiss this question without considering the following points:

Firstly, in section 8, Hermes talks about the wicked or ignorant soul, while in section 19, he refers not just to the "human" soul, but specifically to the human soul that possesses the Good Mind (section 23). On the other hand, the ignorant soul "does not have Mind, and therefore, such a one should not be called a man" (section 24). This gives us a crucial distinction between two types of souls incarnated into a "human body" (section 8). The teachings of section 8 apply to one type of soul, and those of section 19 to another. Reincarnation, in the sense of continuously cycling through life and death, only applies to those who "persist in their vice"—in other words, those who remain ignorant. Gnosis, or knowledge, therefore, means freedom from this cycle of samsara, a term common in both Brahmanical and Buddhist traditions. The ignorant soul cannot see the Light because it is "blinded by the body's passions and tossed about," which is the "turmoil" Plato describes in the Timaeus. For further details, readers should refer to "Plato Concerning Metempsychosis" in the "Prolegomena," a chapter I wrote to clarify the issues raised by our treatise.

GNOSIS: THE VIRTUE OF THE SOUL

So, for the soul that remains in vice or ignorance, the virtue of the soul is Gnosis. "For he who knows, is good and pious, and even while on earth, is divine." This is the same concept as the Jivanmukta in Indian theosophy—someone who has achieved Liberation (Mukti) while still living in the body. Hermes goes on to differentiate Gnosis, the ultimate goal of human knowledge, from mere sense or opinion. Gnosis is the highest state of the mind, its direct perception of reality—the Intelligible Cosmos.The physical world and the nature of man, along with his connection to the universe and God, are explained. 

THE SOUL'S VEHICLES

13. The components of a man's soul are categorized here, with "soul" referring to the Self, distinct from the common understanding of "soul." These components, listed from outermost to innermost, reflecting their closeness to man's true nature, are:

Mind (nous); reason (logos); soul (psyche); spirit (pneuma); body (soma). This categorization is remarkably similar to the psychological concepts found in the Upanishads. For example, the Kathopanishad (I. iii. 10, 11) states:

"Beyond the senses are the rudiments; beyond the rudiments, the impulsive mind; beyond the mind, the reason; beyond the reason, the Great Self. Beyond the Great, the Increate; beyond the Increate, the Man; beyond the Man, there is nothing; That is the goal; That is the final end." The similarities are clear. Body = gross elements; spirit = subtle elements; soul = impulsive mind (manas); reason = reason (buddhi); Mind = the Great (Mahat); Source (akshara) = the Increate; the One and Only (to en kai monon) = the Man. These "vehicles" or "sheaths" (koshas) are also described in the Upanishads as: anna-maya-kosha (body); prana-maya-kosha (spirit); mano-maya-kosha (soul); vijnana-maya-kosha (reason); ananda-maya-kosha (Mind). "Spirit" corresponds to life (prana); it is what gives the living being motion and supports it in a way (section 13).It is not Life, but individualized life, and in the Aupanishad literature, it is divided into five modes, which can be understood as etheric currents or movements in the body.

The quote from Proclus in "Plato Concerning Metempsychosis" shows that this "life" is similar to animal life. It is the soul principle that humans share with animals.

### The Dual Soul

Jamblichus, in his "De Mysteriis" (viii. 6), referring to the "Hermaic writings," says:

"Man has two souls, according to these writings. One comes from the first Mind and shares the power of the Creator. The other, the constrained soul, comes from the movement of the celestial spheres. The former, the soul that sees God, merges with the latter at a later time. This means the soul that comes to us from the celestial spheres aligns with their movement, while the soul from the Mind exists in us in an intelligible way, free from the cycle of birth and death. By this, the bonds of Destiny are broken. This soul provides a path to the Gods, visible only to the mind, and leads to the Great Divine Art, which guides us beyond the spheres of birth to fulfillment."

In our treatise, Hermes is more specific about the so-called "vehicles" or "souls," writing (section 17):

"Mind takes the soul as an envelope. The soul, being divine, uses the spirit as its envelope, while the spirit pervades the living creature."

### The Supreme Principle

The Supreme Principle of all, the One and Only One, who "stands perpetually" (section 14), is the Intelligible Logos (e noete stasis, cf. section 11), similar to the o estus of the Christianized Gnosis, particularly in the Simonian Great Announcement.He is the cause of the endless movement of the physical universe. Compare this with a passage from Numenius:

"There are two ways of life: the first belongs to the First God, and the second to the Second God. It is clear that the First God remains still, while the Second God is in motion. The First God deals with things that are understandable, and the Second with things that are both understandable and perceptible. Do not be surprised by this; you will hear something even more astonishing. I say that it is not the motion of the Second God, but the rest of the First God, which is the inherent 'motion' from which both their cosmic order and eternal community and preservation flow into the universe."

THE OLYMPIAN PATH

In section 15, Gnosis is once again described as the only path to salvation or safety. It is the way up to the mountain, the Olympian Path. The term Eleusis was also interpreted as Anabasis, or the Way Up. Compare this with a Jewish commentator in the Naassene Document (section 27):

"The first mystery is called 'Eleusis' and 'Anaktoreion'—Eleusis because we come from above, streaming down from Adamas, and Anaktoreion from 'Returning Above.'"

WHEN MIND BECOMES A DAIMON

The next major doctrine discussed is extremely important, as it explains the "dark saying" in the "Poemandres" (section 24) about the way up (anodos):

"And you surrender your way of life to the daimon." In our treatise, Hermes tells us that at death:

"The mind, stripped of its wrappings and naturally divine, takes on a fiery body and travels through every space, after leaving the soul to its judgment and whatever punishment it deserves."The key to this is the sentence (section 21):

"When the mind becomes a daimon, it must take on a fiery body to serve God." [p. 172]

At death, the mind naturally becomes a "servant of God," a Therapeut [*1]; the person becomes their own judge and punisher. The "fire of hell" is actually the burning remorse of a mind that now understands the consequences of every selfish thought, word, and action. Every action inevitably comes back to the one who initiated it. The soul experiences the consequences of its past misdeeds in a very realistic way, understanding the law in all its details. This suggests a deep wisdom in the teachings of these schools. Compare this reasonable theory of after-death "illumination" with the crude idea of eternal torment in popular religion, and consider how far we have fallen from the early days of Gnosis. The "fiery body" of the mind is the ray-like or starry vehicle of the person, the aygoeides e astroeides of Philoponus. [*2]

This is the true "Astral Body" of a person, not the "watery vesture" referred to in modern terms. It is the true Body of Purification, burning away all impurities and embedding the memory of Gnosis into the person. The soul is thus "chastised by its own self." If Hermes had taught us nothing else, he would still deserve humanity's gratitude and the title of Thrice-greatest. Yet, "Hermes" is not a single person, but a mind illuminated by the Mind. THE "SCOURGE" OF THE CHRIST

21.The wicked soul, tormented by its own sins, is immersed in acts like murder, violence, blasphemy, and other harmful behaviors. This suffering is the punishment Christ uses to drive the unworthy out of His Temple. It doesn't mean the soul is forced to commit these acts, but rather it experiences the consequences of its past wrongdoings. The soul suffers the same wrongs it inflicted on others, which becomes clear when the Light of Gnosis highlights the darkness of its past actions.

THE ORDER OF THE UNIVERSE

Hermes explains "the order of the universe" as the connection between different levels of existence, from God down to humans, and the interaction of souls. God, the Cosmos, and Man are different levels of being, each functioning like a sun with its own powers or rays. God's rays are His energies, the Cosmos's rays are the natures of things, and Man's rays are the arts and sciences. This connection between higher and lower beings is achieved through the sacred union, allowing a man to become divine and ultimately one with God. Only those filled with God are truly blessed—these are the true Gnostics who have received the fullness of divine knowledge.

On the other hand, a soul that lacks God is devoid of this fullness and is empty of divine wisdom. Hermes says such souls shouldn't even be called human. A true human is not only equal to a god but even greater. In Christian terms, such a person would be called a Christ—one filled with the Spirit of God.

The Egyptians clearly believed in soul transformation, and when we find people in Egypt teaching this transformation alongside reincarnation, it makes sense to conclude that the Greeks, who had direct contact with Egyptian traditions, knew more about it than modern skeptics.

### CORPUS HERMETICUM XI. (XII.) MIND UNTO HERMES

(Text: P. 85-99; Pat. 20b-23.)

1. **Mind**: Master this sermon (logos), Thrice-greatest Hermes, and remember the spoken words; as it has come to Me to speak, I will not delay further.

**Hermes**: Many men say many different things about the All and the Good, and I have not learned the truth. Please make it clear to me, O Master, for I trust only Your explanation of these matters.

2. **Mind**:Listen, my son, to how God and everything are arranged. God, Eternity, Universe, Time, and Becoming.

God creates Eternity; Eternity creates the Universe; the Universe creates Time; and Time creates Becoming.

Goodness, Beauty, Wisdom, and Blessedness are the essence of God; Sameness is the essence of Eternity; Order is the essence of the Universe; Change is the essence of Time; and Life and Death are the essence of Becoming. The energies of God are Mind and Soul; the energies of Eternity are permanence and immortality; the energies of the Universe are creation and destruction; the energies of Time are growth and decline; and the energies of Becoming are qualities. Eternity is within God; the Universe is within Eternity; Time is within the Universe; and Becoming is within Time. Eternity surrounds God; the Universe moves within Eternity; Time has its boundaries within the Universe; and Becoming happens within Time.

Therefore, the source of everything is God; their essence is Eternity; their material form is the Universe. God's power is Eternity; Eternity's work is the Universe, which never fully becomes yet is always in the process of becoming through Eternity. Therefore, the Universe will never be destroyed because Eternity is indestructible; nothing in the Universe truly perishes because the Universe is completely encompassed by Eternity.

Hermes: But what is God's Wisdom?
Mind: It is the Good, the Beautiful, Blessedness, all Virtue, and Eternity.

Eternity orders the Universe, giving immortality and permanence to matter. The becoming of the Universe depends on Eternity, just as Eternity depends on God. Now the processes of Genesis and Time, in Heaven and on Earth, have two different natures. In Heaven, they are unchangeable and indestructible, but on Earth, they are subject to change and destruction. Moreover, the soul of Eternity is God; the soul of the Universe is Eternity; the soul of the Earth is Heaven. God is in Mind; Mind is in Soul; Soul is in Matter; and all these exist through Eternity. This entire Body, which contains all bodies, is full of Soul; and Soul is full of Mind, and Mind is full of God. It fills the Body from within and encircles it from without, giving life to everything.Outside, this vast and perfect Life encircles the Cosmos; inside, it fills it with all living beings. Above, in Heaven, it remains constant; below, on Earth, it continuously changes. Aeon preserves this Cosmos, whether by Necessity, Foreknowledge, Nature, or any other force one might imagine. All of this is God in action. God's Energy is a Power that surpasses everything, incomparable to anything human or divine. Therefore, Hermes, never think that anything above or below is like God, for you would stray from the truth. Nothing compares to the One who is unique and singular. Do not ever think anyone else can possess His power; for what exists apart from Him that has life, immortality, or change? What else could He create? God is always active, for if He were inactive, everything would lack activity; all things are full of God. Inaction cannot be attributed to either the creator or the creation.

All things must be created, continuously, and in accordance with the influence of every space. He who creates is in everything, not confined to any single part, nor creating just one thing, but making all things. Being Power, He is active in what He creates and not separate from them, even though they are subject to Him. Now, look through me at the Cosmos you can see; observe its Beauty carefully—a Body in pure perfection, the most ancient yet ever young, always in its prime, and even more perfect with time. Look again at the seven subject Worlds, ordered by Aeon's command, fulfilling their varied courses under Aeon's influence.Observe how everything is filled with light, yet there is no fire; this light is born from the harmony and blending of opposites and differences. It shines down through the power of God, the Father of all goodness, the Leader of order, and the Ruler of the seven levels of the universe. Notice the Moon, the forerunner of all, the tool of nature, and the transformer of lower matter. Look at the Earth, positioned in the center of everything, the foundation of the beautiful cosmos, the provider and nurturer of earthly things. Consider the multitude of immortal beings and those subject to death, with the Moon circling between them. 

All are filled with Soul and moved by it in their unique ways; some move around the Heaven, others around the Earth. See how the right does not move to the left, nor the left to the right; the above does not move below, nor the below above. All these are subject to creation, dear Hermes, as you no longer need to learn from me. They have bodies, souls, and are in motion, but they cannot unite into one without someone to bring them together. This unifier must be someone who is entirely One.

Since their various motions are different and their bodies unlike, yet they all follow one ordered speed, it is impossible that there are multiple creators. A single order cannot be maintained among many creators, as it would lead to conflict. If the creator of mortal beings were different from the creator of immortal beings, each would desire to create the other as well. But let us move on.If there are two things—Matter and Soul—who is responsible for distributing them for creation? If both have some role, who has the greater part? Consider this: every living being consists of soul and matter, whether it is immortal, mortal, or irrational. All living beings have souls, while non-living things are just matter.

In the same way, the Soul, by itself, is the cause of life, created by its maker. But the ultimate cause of all life is the one who creates immortal beings. 

Her: How is it that mortal lives are different from immortal ones? And why doesn't the source of immortal life make all beings immortal?

Mind: First, it's clear that there's someone who does these things, and second, this someone is one. Soul is one, Life is one, and Matter is one.

Her: But who is this being?

Mind: Who else but the One God? Who else would it be fitting to give life to souls but God alone? God is one. It would be absurd to think that the Cosmos is one, the Sun is one, the Moon is one, and God is one, yet assume that God is multiple.

Therefore, God creates everything in many ways. What is so extraordinary about God creating life, soul, immortality, and change, when you yourself do many things? You see, speak, hear, smell, taste, touch, walk, think, and breathe. It isn't one person who sees, another who speaks, another who touches, and so on. It is one person who does all these things. And none of these actions could exist without God.Just as you would no longer be alive if you stopped doing certain things, God would no longer be God if He ceased His works (though it is improper to say). Since nothing can be inactive, how much less can God be? If He didn’t create everything, He would be imperfect. But since He is perfect and not inactive, He creates all things. Stay with me, Hermes, for a moment, and you will understand more easily that God's work is unified, enabling all things to exist—whether they are being made, have been made, or will be made. This is Life; this is the Beautiful; this is the Good; this is God.

If you want to understand this practically, consider what happens when you wish to create. However, this is different because God does not derive pleasure from His work as humans do. He works alone, constantly active, and His work is an extension of Himself. If He separated Himself from His work, everything would collapse and die, as life would cease. Since all things are alive and life is one, God is one. All living things, both in Heaven and on Earth, are made alive by God, who is life itself. Life is the unity of Mind and Soul, and death is not their destruction but the dissolution of their union.

Aeon is God's image; the Cosmos is Aeon's image; the Sun is the image of the Cosmos, and Man is the image of the Sun. People call change death because the body dissolves, and when life dissolves, it returns to the unseen.In this sermon, Hermes, my beloved, as you listen, I say that the Cosmos also undergoes change. Each day, a part of it becomes unmanifest, yet it is never destroyed. These changes in the Cosmos are its cycles and hidden periods; cycles represent transformation, and hidden periods represent renewal.

The Cosmos contains all forms, not by having forms outside of itself, but by changing forms within itself. Since the Cosmos is all-formed, what can its creator be like? On one hand, the creator cannot be completely without form, and on the other hand, if the creator has all forms, then the creator would be like the Cosmos. However, if the creator has only one form, that would make the creator less than the Cosmos. What, then, do we say the creator is?—so we don't fall into doubt in our discussion. Nothing the mind conceives about God is doubtful. The creator has one idea, which is unique and does not fall under sight, being without a body, yet through bodies, all ideas are manifested. Do not be surprised that there is a bodiless idea.

For it is like the form of reason and mountain-tops in pictures. They appear to stand out distinctly, but are actually smooth and flat. Now consider a bolder but truer statement! Just as man cannot live without Life, neither can God exist without doing good. This is as if it were the life and movement of God—to move all things and give them life.

Some things I have said should be understood in their unique context. For example, understand this: all things are in God, but not as if they are in a physical place. For a place is a body and is immovable, and things in a place do not move. Things exist one way in the bodiless and another way when they are made manifest.Consider Him who holds everything together; understand that nothing is more comprehensive, swifter, or more powerful than the bodiless. It is the most comprehensive, the swiftest, and the most powerful of all. Now, think from within yourself and command your soul to go to any land; it will be there even faster than you can command. Tell it to travel across the ocean, and it will be there instantly, not as if moving from one place to another, but as if it were already there. Command it to ascend to heaven, and it will need no wings, nor will anything hinder it—not the sun's fire, nor the aether, nor vortices, nor the bodies of other stars. It will cut through them all and soar to the highest realm. And if you wish to break through even this and contemplate what lies beyond the cosmos, if anything does, you are allowed to do so.

Behold the power and swiftness you possess! If you can do all these things, surely God can as well. Understand God in this way: as having everything within Himself as thoughts, including the entire cosmos. If you do not make yourself like God, you cannot know Him. For only the similar can know the similar. Therefore, grow to the same stature as the greatness that transcends all measure; free yourself from every physical limitation; transcend time and become eternity. In doing so, you will know God. 

Believe that nothing is impossible for you; think yourself immortal and capable of knowing everything—all arts, all sciences, every way of life. Become higher than the highest and lower than the lowest. Embrace within yourself all the senses of all creatures—of fire, water, dryness, and moisture. Imagine that you are everywhere at the same time—on earth, in the sea, in the sky; not yet born, in the womb, young, old, dead, and in the afterlife.If you understand all these things at once—times, places, actions, qualities, and quantities—you can know God.

But if you confine your soul within your body and degrade it by saying: "I know nothing; I can do nothing; I fear the sea; I cannot reach the sky; I don't know who I was or who I will be"—what is there between you and God? For you can't know anything beautiful and good as long as you love your body and are bad.

The greatest harm is not knowing God's Good; but being able to know Good, and having the will and hope to do so, is a Straight Path, the Good's own Path, both leading to and easy to follow.

If you set your foot on this path, it will meet you everywhere and be seen everywhere—when you least expect it, whether you are awake, asleep, sailing, traveling, by night, by day, speaking, or silent. For there is nothing that is not an image of the Good.

Is God unseen? Hush! Who is more obvious than He? For this reason, He made all things, so that through them all, you may see Him. This is the Good of God, this is His Virtue—that He may be made manifest through all.

Nothing is unseen, even things without a body. The mind sees itself in thinking, God in creating.

So far, these things have been made clear to you, Thrice-greatest one! Reflect on all the rest in the same way within yourself, and you shall not be misled.Convert the following text into modern English; correct and simplify the text without altering its original meaning:

#### Title and Form

The title in the manuscripts (MSS.) is simply "Mind to Hermes." Therefore, when Cyril quotes the first three paragraphs of section 22 and says that Hermes wrote these words "to his own mind," he either misread the text or had not seen the original document. The treatise's format clearly references the "Poemandres," a type of instructional text directed at Hermes (or a figure named Hermes). This authoritative style was chosen to provide deeper instruction compared to the "General Sermons" and similar texts. Specifically, it aims to teach the Aeon-doctrine and the concept of At-one-ment with all things, which is essential to the Path of the Good. The teaching has evolved from "Become like the Cosmos" to "Become Aeon" (section 20).It is notable that the teachings given by the Mind to Hermes in our treatise closely match, almost point for point, the "esoteric" teachings presented in Hermes' sermon to Tat, called the "Cup or Monad." This sermon is known as the "exoteric" version. The instruction in these Trismegistic schools of initiation was clearly divided into levels. Therefore, it is natural to find these two sermons closely related in their doctrines, with one providing a more detailed and advanced explanation of the other's general teachings.

It's clear that the inner teachings on the "Cup" doctrine were considered very important. This is evident because the "Cup" sermon was one of Hermes' most famous works. Its title was even worth copying, and the Baptism of the Cup, which it discussed, was the ultimate goal for the disciples of the School, as Zosimus tells us. Mystically, the central focus of our treatise is the doctrine of At-one-ment, seen as the inner completion of the Baptism in the Cup or Monad. The Aeon-idea serves as a formal introduction to this concept. Historically, however, the introduction of the Aeon-idea presents a critical problem because the term is not found in the "Poemandres" and presumably was not used in the earliest documents of the School.

When did this Aeon-idea become part of the older tradition of the Trismegistic schools? Answering this question is important, as it would help us determine the timeline for the earlier forms of Hermetic doctrine. It seems likely that the Aeon-doctrine influenced "Hermeticism" around the same time it influenced "Gnosticism."Now, "Gnosticism," in its Christian forms, almost always includes Aeon-lore. The earliest forms of Christian Gnosis mentioned by later Church heresy experts are connected with Aeonology. Moreover, the very first reference to Gnosticism by any Christian writer assumes the Aeon-doctrine and uses it to illustrate the writer's spiritual state.

The widespread influence of the Aeon-doctrine can be traced back to the origins of Christianity. Since Gnosis existed before any Christian version of it developed, the introduction of the Aeon-doctrine must date back to pre-Christian times. The simplicity of the Aeon-lore in our text, compared to the complex and transcendent Christian Gnosticism of the first and second centuries, supports an early date for its introduction into "Hermeticism," which is essentially a Hellenic form of "Gnosticism." If this reasoning is correct, it strongly suggests that the older forms of the Trismegistic texts were pre-Christian. This is evident from the identical teachings in our text (section 2) and those of Philo, who writes:

"But God is also the Creator of Time. For He is the Father of its Father; and Time's Father is the Cosmos, which shows its motion in the creation of Time. This Cosmos, the Younger Son, the Sensible, in motion, has caused Time's nature to appear and disappear. With God, nothing is in the future, as He has control over the very Bounds of Time. For it is not Time, but Time's Archetype and Paradigm, Eternity (or Aeon), which is His Life. In Eternity, nothing is past and nothing is future; all is present only."This passage from Philo is crucial for determining the date of our treatises. It shows that the oldest forms of the Trismegistic literature existed before Christianity, and it suggests that our treatise, which is a later version of this literature, could be dated to the same period as Philo. Chapter 11 in the Prolegomena, "Concerning the Aeon-Doctrine," should be closely related to this treatise, as it not only introduces it but often directly refers to it. Overall, detailed comments are unnecessary because the writer's instructions are clear enough for any careful reader to understand after familiarizing themselves with the general ideas in the previous treatises. However, a few notes on specific points can be made.

THE ROOT OF FORM

In section 16, the sentence: "The Cosmos is all-formed (pantomorfos),--not having forms external to itself, but changing them itself within itself," recalls P. S. A., xix. 3: "The 'Thirty-six' who have the name of Horoscopes are in the same space as the fixed stars; of these, the essence-chief, or prince, is called Pantomorph, or Omniform (pantomorfos, vel omniformis), who shapes the various forms for various species"; and also P. S. A., xxxv.: "But they change as many times as there are moments in the hour of that revolving circle in which abides the God we have called All-form." Compare this to C. H., xiii. (xiv.) 12, where Hermes speaks of the "Circle of the types of life" as "composed of elements, twelve in number, but of one nature, an omniform idea." Also, consider Hermes-Prayer iv., addressed to Thoth as the Logos:

"I invoke you alone, you who alone in all the Cosmos impose order on gods and men, who transform yourself into holy forms, creating from things that are not, and making things that are cease to be."The main interest of our treatise is not just that the Intelligible Cosmos or Logos can create, destroy, and transform all forms at will, but that humans, as the microcosm, have this great magical power within them. "BECOME ALL THINGS"

The bold instruction given to Hermes in sections 19 and 20 is clearly a practice of Egyptian Wisdom. It is presented plainly and directly, without any mysterious hints or evasions. This shows it belongs to the same ideas that Egyptian theurgy touched upon. However, while the philosopher-mystic was encouraged to achieve this through their own efforts, the theurgist had to ask a god for help.

In the same prayer we mentioned earlier, we read in sections 2 and 3:

"O holy Thoth, whose true face no god can endure to see! Make me assume the form of any creature—wolf, dog, or lion, fire, tree, or vulture, wall, or water, or whatever you wish, for you have the power to do so." Similarly, in P. S. A., vii., we find the same idea, suggesting something beyond ordinary human capabilities. "He mingles with the elements due to the swiftness of his mind. He dives into the sea's depths thanks to its profundity. He assesses the value of all things. "The sky does not seem too high for him; he measures it with his wisdom as if it were close. "No darkness of the air blocks his mind’s insight. No density of the earth stops his work. No depth of water hinders his vision. "Though he remains the same, he is all things, and everywhere he is the same."

This indeed sketches a remarkable "yoga" system in our treatise.There is no question here of abstraction or negation, but a brave identification or unity with all living and breathing things. This is the Path of Gnosis, the Way to Know God. In simpler terms, man should emulate his prototype, the Mind. Just as the Mind or Man in the "Poemandres" treatise aimed to break through the Boundary of the spheres (section 13), our philosopher is encouraged to "soar up to the Last Body of them all" (section 19), which is the One Element of the Cosmos itself.

"And if you wish to break through this as well and contemplate what lies beyond, if anything exists beyond the Cosmos, you are allowed to do so." The rigid distinctions modern commentators make between words when considering these mystical treatises would have been laughed at by their original writers. This is clearly shown when the writer enthusiastically declares:

"Then know God in this way, as having within Himself the whole Cosmos as thoughts. If you do not make yourself like God, you cannot know Him. For like can only be known by like. Therefore, make yourself grow to the same greatness that transcends all measure; leap beyond every body; transcend all time; become Eternity; and thus you will know God." Every physical body or space must be transcended, even the Body of the Cosmos itself. Man must grow into the "greatness that transcends all measure," which is the intelligible, superspatial Pleroma, the Aeon as the Logos and Paradigm of the Cosmos. Likewise, every instance of time must be transcended; man must become Eternity, the Aeon as the Paradigm of Time.

THE PATH OF GOOD

In no scripture that I know is this Path more admirably set forth—the Path of Good.All things, all places, and all times must be understood as existing within oneself simultaneously. If this is truly realized, not just imagined, a person becomes a true Knower of God, a Gnostic.

There is no truer statement about the path to the Supreme than these wonderful words:

"If you set your foot on this path, it will meet you everywhere, even when you least expect it—whether awake, asleep, traveling, or at rest, by night or day, speaking or silent. For everything is an image of the Good."

In conclusion, I would only point out that if we follow Patrizzi's correction for the first sentence of section 19, as adopted by Parthey, we get the interesting sentence:

"And, thus, think from yourself, and instruct your soul to go unto India." If this is the original reading, it is remarkable that India was chosen. However, we know from studying the life of Apollonius of Tyana, that this "Gnostic" philosopher spread Indian ideas widely among philosophical and mystical communities in the first century. Apollonius likely knew a great deal about the siddhis (spiritual powers) gained through yoga practices. His biographer, Philostratus, records Apollonius writing the following letter to his Eastern hosts after returning from India:

"I came to you by land, and you have given me the sea; rather, by sharing your wisdom, you have given me the power to travel through heaven. I will bring these insights back to the Greeks and converse with you as if you were present, unless I have drunk from the Cup of Tantalus in vain."The strong interest in Indian ideas in Alexandria is evident from the fact that in 242, Plotinus joined Gordian's expedition to the East hoping to encounter Indian wisdom. However, these considerations are only relevant if we believe that Patrizzi's correction is well-founded. If this reading is confirmed by evidence, we would need to revisit the date in light of it, although a definitive result seems unlikely. While Apollonius' promotion of Indian ideas couldn't have started before the mid-first century, this isn't a reliable indicator because "India" must have been a topic of interest even before Apollonius' journey. Otherwise, why would he have undertaken such a long and dangerous trip? In fact, "India" had been a subject of interest since Alexander's expedition, starting from the early Alexandrian period in the fourth century B.C.**Corpus Hermeticum XII (XIII): About the Common Mind**

1. **Hermes:** Tat, the Mind is essentially part of God—if indeed God has an essence. Only the Mind truly understands what this essence is. The Mind isn't separate from God but is united with Him, like light to the sun. This Mind within humans is God, which explains why some humans are like gods and their humanity is close to divinity. As the Good Daimon said, "Gods are immortal men, and men are mortal gods."

2. In irrational beings, their nature is mindless. Where there is a soul, there is also Mind; just as where there is life, there is a soul. However, in irrational beings, their soul is life without mind. The Mind works for the good of human souls, acting upon them for their benefit. In irrational beings, the Mind cooperates with their nature; but in humans, it opposes their base desires. When a soul enters a body, it is corrupted by pleasure and pain. These emotions, like mixed liquids, affect the soul when it enters the body.

3. The Mind oversees certain souls, showing them its light by counteracting their desires, much like a good doctor treats a sick body by inflicting necessary pain for the sake of health. Similarly, the Mind causes the soul pain to free it from pleasure, which is the source of all its troubles. The greatest trouble for a soul is godlessness, followed by a desire for all things evil and nothing good. Therefore, the Mind works against these desires, healing the soul much like a doctor heals the body.If human souls do not have the Mind as their guide, they end up like the souls of irrational beings. The Mind works with them, allowing them to follow their desires, which often lead them to irrational behavior. These human souls, like irrational animals, continuously act out of rage and lust and are never satisfied. Great evils arise from passions and irrational desires, and God has appointed the Mind to judge and control these impulses. 

Tat: In that case, father, your earlier teachings about Fate seem to be contradicted. If it is fated for a person to commit sins like fornication or sacrilege, why are they punished for actions driven by Fate?

Her: All actions, good or bad, are governed by Fate, and nothing happens without it. But it is also fated that those who do wrong will suffer as a consequence. They commit wrongdoings to experience the suffering that follows.

For now, let's set aside the discussion about vice and Fate, as we have covered these topics before. Let's focus on the Mind: what it can do, how it differs in humans and animals, and how it suppresses wrath and lust in humans. We must categorize humans as either rational or irrational. All humans are subject to Fate, birth, and change, as these are the beginning and the end of Fate.And although all people experience what fate has in store, those guided by reason (those led by the Mind) do not suffer in the same way as others. Because they have freed themselves from vice and are not bad, they do not suffer the effects of being bad. 

Tat: What do you mean, father? Isn't a fornicator bad? Isn't a murderer bad? And so on with all the rest?

Her: I didn't mean it that way. What I meant is that a man guided by the Mind, even if he is not a fornicator, will suffer as if he had committed fornication. And even if he is not a murderer, he will suffer as if he had committed murder. He cannot escape the quality of change any more than he can escape birth. But it is possible for someone with the Mind to free himself from vice.

I have often heard, my son, the Good Daimon say (and if he had written it down, he would have greatly helped humanity, for he alone, as the First-born God, sees everything and speaks divine words)--once I heard him say:

"All things are one, especially the bodies the mind alone perceives. Our life comes from God's Energy, Power, and Aeon. His Mind is Good, as is His Soul. Because of this, intelligible things are not separate. Therefore, the Mind, being the Ruler of all things and the Soul of God, can do whatever it wants."

So understand this and relate it back to your question about the Mind's Fate. If you eliminate all misleading arguments, you will discover that truly the Mind, the Soul of God, rules over all things--over Fate, Law, and everything else. Nothing is impossible for it--neither to set a human soul above Fate nor to place a soul under Fate if it neglects what happens. Let this suffice from the Good Daimon's most good words.

Tat: Yes, father, these are truly divine and helpful words.Please explain this further to me. You said that the Mind in irrational beings operates according to their nature, working with their impulses. But I believe the impulses of irrational beings are passions. If the Mind works with these impulses, and if the impulses of irrational beings are passions, then the Mind must also be a passion, influenced by these passions.

Well said, my son! Your question is very thoughtful, and it deserves a thoughtful answer. All non-physical things, when in a body, are subject to passion and, in a way, they are passions themselves. Everything that moves another is non-physical, while everything that is moved is physical.

Non-physical things are moved by the Mind, and movement involves passion. Therefore, both the mover and the moved are subject to passion—the former being the ruler, and the latter being ruled. However, when a person frees themselves from the body, they are also freed from passion. Yet, nothing is completely without passion; everything can experience it. Passion is different from susceptibility to passion; one is active, while the other is passive. Non-physical things can act on themselves; they are either motionless or moved, but in either case, it involves passion. Physical bodies are always acted upon and are therefore susceptible to passion. Don't be confused by the terms; action and passion are essentially the same thing. Using a more pleasant term doesn't cause any harm.

Most clearly, father, you have explained the teaching. 

Consider this as well, my son; God has given humans two things beyond all other mortal beings—both mind and speech (logos) akin to immortality. The mind is for knowing God, and speech (logos) is for praising Him.

If one uses these gifts properly, they will not differ from the immortals.When leaving the body, one will be guided by two beings to the Choir of Gods and Blessed Ones.

Tat: Father, don't other beings also use speech?

Her: No, son. They use voice, which is different from speech. Speech is common to all humans, while voice varies among different types of living beings.

Tat: But even among humans, speech varies by race.

Her: Yes, but humanity is one, so speech is one and can be understood universally, whether in Egypt, Persia, or Greece. You seem unaware of the value and greatness of Reason (Logos). The Blessed God, Good Daimon, has said:

"Soul is in Body, Mind in Soul; Reason (Logos) is in Mind, and Mind in God; and God is the Father of all these."

Reason is the image of Mind, and Mind is the image of God, while Body is the image of Form, and Form is the image of Soul. The most subtle part of Matter is Air; of Air, Soul; of Soul, Mind; and of Mind, God.

God surrounds and permeates everything; Mind surrounds Soul, Soul surrounds Air, and Air surrounds Matter. Necessity, Providence, and Nature are the instruments of the Cosmos and the organization of Matter. For intelligible things, each is Essence, and Sameness is their Essence. However, in the Cosmos, each body contains many parts. Despite changing forms, these composed bodies maintain the incorruptibility of their Sameness.

In all other composed bodies, each has a specific number; without number, there can be no structure, composition, or decomposition. Units create and increase number and, when decomposed, return to their original form.Matter is singular, and the entire Cosmos—an embodiment of the supreme God and unified with Him, maintaining the Will and Order of the Father—is filled with Life.

There is nothing within the entirety of Aeon, the Father’s everlasting Re-establishment, nor within the whole or its parts, that does not live. There has never been, is not now, and will never be anything dead in this Cosmos because the Father intended it to have Life as long as it exists. Therefore, it must be a God. How, then, my son, could there be any dead things within the God, the image of the Father, who is full of Life? Death is corruption, and corruption is destruction. So, how could any part of something incorruptible be corrupted or any part of the God be destroyed?

Tat: Do the living parts within it not die, father?

Her: No, my son. Do not be misled by common terms. They do not die but are instead dissolved as compound bodies. Dissolution is not death; it is merely the breaking down of a compound body so that it can be renewed. Life’s activity is motion. What in the Cosmos lacks motion? Nothing, my son.

Tat: Does the Earth not seem to lack motion, father?

Her: No, son. On the contrary, she is the only thing that, while in rapid motion, remains stable. It would be laughable to think that the Nurse of all things has no motion when she creates and sustains all things. It is impossible for one who creates to do so without motion. Asking if the fourth part is inert is absurd because a body without motion signifies nothing but inertia.Know, my son, that everything in the universe is constantly changing, either growing or shrinking. Anything that moves is alive, but not everything that lives is the same.

Although the universe as a whole doesn't change, its parts do; yet nothing within it is corrupted or destroyed. It's the words people use that cause confusion. Life isn't defined by birth but by sensation, and death isn't defined by change but by forgetfulness. Since this is true, everything is immortal—matter, life, spirit, mind, and soul, which together make up all living things.

Whatever is alive owes its immortality to the mind, and this is especially true for humans, who are connected to God. God communicates with humans through dreams, signs, and various natural phenomena, enabling them to understand the past, present, and future.

Remember, my son, that different creatures live in different parts of the universe: aquatic creatures in water, land creatures on earth, and air creatures in the sky. Humans, however, interact with all these elements—earth, water, air, and fire. They can also perceive the heavens and connect with it through their senses.

God surrounds and permeates everything because He is energy and power. It's not difficult to understand God. To contemplate Him, observe the order of the universe and how everything operates in harmony. Notice how necessity and providence govern all creation, and see how matter is filled with life. Witness this great God in motion, along with all good beings—gods, spirits, and humans.These are purely energies, my father. If they're purely energies, my son, then who energizes them if not God? Don't you know that just as Heaven, Earth, Water, and Air are parts of the Cosmos, so too are Life, Immortality, Energy, Spirit, Necessity, Providence, Nature, Soul, Mind, and what we call Good all parts of God? There is nothing in existence where God is not present.

Tat: Is God in Matter, then, father?
Her: Matter, my son, is separate from God so that you can think of it as having space. But what else could it be if it's not energized? And if it is energized, by whom? We said energies are parts of God. Who enlivens all lives? Who grants immortality? Who makes things changeable? Whether you speak of Matter, Body, or Essence, know that these are also energies of God. Materiality is Matter's energy, corporality is Bodies' energy, and essentiality is the energy of Essence. This is God—the All.

In the All, there is nothing that is not God. Therefore, size, space, quality, form, and time do not limit God; He is All, and All surrounds and permeates everything. Worship and adore this Reason (Logos), my son. There is only one way to worship God: do not be bad.The only way to escape the bonds of Fate is through "piety" or "godliness." Refer to R. 102, 1 for more information. 

The critical text of this paragraph can be found in R. 78. The terms translated as "act," "active," and "action" could be more literally rendered as "energize," "energic," and "energy." The "motionless" has "energy" because it causes motion in what it moves.

Following the emendation of R., the critical text of the above paragraphs is found in R. 156, n. 6. The word-play of the original cannot be fully conveyed in English, resulting in a loss of the double meaning. Some scribe added this sentence to the end of C. H., v. (vi.). Refer to section 20 below. Reading "anagke" for "anagkei"; see section 21 below. 

"Pleroma of Life" is a term used here. The word "apokatastasis" appears. Reading "patros" for "pantos." "Pleroma" is mentioned again. The critical text of the last five paragraphs is available in R. 25, n. 1. 

Refer to section 14 above for more context. An "Aeon" is implied. Lactantius, D. I., vi. 25, translates the last two sentences into Latin with the remark that Hermes spoke about "Justice." See the following Commentary on section 6, and Ex. xi. Thrice-Greatest Hermes, Vol. 2, by G.R.S. Mead, [1906], at sacred-texts.com.

COMMENTARY

THE SAYINGS OF THE GOOD DAIMON

This sermon discusses the Common or General Mind, also known as the Great Mind, Good Mind, or Good Daimon. As mentioned in section 2, Mind is the Benefactor of humans (eyergetes anthrw'pun); He is referred to as the Good Shepherd, the Good Farmer, and the Good Physician in different writings.From a critical standpoint, the most interesting point is that Hermes, in three different sections (1, 8, and 13), quotes some Sayings of the Good Daimon. The first quotation in section 1—"Gods are immortal men, and men are mortal Gods"—is a well-known Saying of Heracleitus. However, Hermes does not mean to say that Heracleitus was the Good Daimon, but rather that Heracleitus was speaking on behalf of the Good Mind when he said this "word" (logos). This was not just Hermes' opinion; it seems to have been Heracleitus' own belief as well when he stated:

"Not because you hear me say so, but because you hear the Reason (Logos) declare it, is it wise to confess that All are One."

Heracleitus used the term Logos to mean the All-pervading Reason, not just human reason, as interpreted by Hippolytus.

So, it is surprising to find the second quotation of a Saying of the Good Daimon by Hermes (section 8) qualified by the words "And had He set it down in written words" or "in writing," especially since this quotation begins with the words: "All are One"—a fundamental idea of Heracleitus. Such Sayings of Heracleitus must have been widely known among philosophers and their students at the time. However, Hermes' quotation does not end with Heracleitus' formula; it continues, though it is hard to determine exactly how far. Reitzenstein suggests it ends with the word "Aeon," but I believe it continues to the end of section 8. Either way, it includes the term "Aeon."

When we look at the third quotation from the Sayings of the Good Daimon (section 13), it closely resembles the style of teaching found in Corpus Hermeticum, chapter 11 (chapter 12), section 4. While there is no exact verbal match, the style and formula are strikingly similar.In our treatise, the Saying is used to illustrate the meaning of Reason (Logos) authoritatively. In the "Mind to Hermes," which is the sermon of the Good Daimon to Hermes, Reason is omitted, as Mind and Reason are surpassed by Aeon and Mind. Moreover, the style of what follows this quotation in our treatise matches the instructional style in "Corpus Hermeticum" XI (XII), with short, categorical statements. Additionally, the previous quotation (section 8) features the key word Aeon, which is central to the teaching of "Mind to Hermes." Therefore, I conclude that our Hermes is using a more intimate form of instruction, known only to those at the Hermes-grade and not published for those at the Tat-degree. When he says it hasn't been written down, he means it hasn't been allowed to be published for those in the Tat-stage. This suggests that there were other treatises now lost, similar in nature to "Mind to Hermes," which included quotations from the Sayings of Heracleitus. Heracleitus, known as the "Obscure Philosopher," was seen as someone who had direct contact with the Logos or Mind and thus spoke with the authority of direct revelation.

HERMES AND BASILIDES

The next point of interest is in section 7:

"I did not mean that, but that the Mind-led man, my son, though not a fornicator, will suffer as if he had committed fornication, and though he is not a murderer, as if he had committed murder." If we now turn to the quotation that Clement of Alexandria gives us from Book XXIII…In the Exegetica of Basilides, we read:

"Just as a baby, who, although it has done no wrong or committed any sin, still has the potential for sin, benefits from suffering in ways that are otherwise hard to achieve; similarly, a perfect man who hasn’t sinned in action but suffers, does so in the same way as a baby. He has the potential for sin within him but chooses not to act on it, and therefore does not sin. So, even such a man should not be considered incapable of sin. Just as the desire to commit fornication makes someone a fornicator, even if they don't actually commit the act, and the desire to commit murder makes someone a murderer, even if they can't carry it out; the same goes for the 'sinless' man. If I see him suffering, even if he hasn't actually sinned, I will say he is evil because of his will to sin. For I would rather say anything than claim that Providence is evil."

Providence, as discussed in our treatise, is the instrument of Good, representing the Will of God. It is the human will that is the source of evil, as we learn from Corpus Hermeticum: "For it’s not God, but we who are the cause of evil, by choosing it over good." Our treatise addresses the same problem as in the Exegetica of Basilides. Hermes speaks of the "Mind-led man" or "the man with Logos within him"; Basilides speaks of the "perfect man." In Corpus Hermeticum, the "perfect man" is one who has "received the Mind." The ideas of Hermes and Basilides are nearly identical; both notably cite fornication and murder as typical sins and no others.Compare the idea of the infant in Basilides with the words of Hermes in Corpus Hermeticum, Book 11, Section 15:

"Look at the soul of an infant, my son. It is not yet separated from the cosmic soul because its body is still small and has not yet fully developed. Such a soul is beautiful to see, not yet stained by the body's passions, almost still connected to the Cosmic Soul."

Now, compare this with what Hippolytus tells us about Valentinus:

"Valentinus says he once saw a newborn baby and questioned it to find out who it was. The baby replied that it was the Logos." Also, consider the Psalm of Valentinus as quoted by the same scholar:

"I see all things dependent on Spirit;
All things supported by Spirit;
Flesh dependent on Soul;
Soul supported by Air;
Air hanging from Aether;
Fruits borne of the Deep;
Baby borne of the Womb."

Here, as in other cases, we see close connections between Hermetic and Christian Gnosis. Is there any question of direct plagiarism? I think not. Instead, I believe that both Christian scholars and Hermetic philosophers were connected to the same source of inner teachings.

In regards to the action of the Mind on the soul during incarnation (section 4), compare with Corpus Hermeticum, Book 11, Sections 18 and 19, where the role of the Mind in relation to the soul outside of incarnation is vividly described.

THE SERMONS ON FATE

In section 6, Hermes tells us he has already discussed Fate in other sermons. In sections 14 and 21, he refers three times to Necessity and Providence. It is noteworthy that Lactantius, in quoting the last two sentences of our treatise, mentions that he takes them from a Sermon by Hermes "On Justice." Stobaeus has also preserved for us an excerpt from a Sermon dealing with Justice, Providence, Necessity, and Fate.From a sermon of Hermes to Tat about Fate, which ends with: "This is the sermon on the rule of Providence, Necessity, and Fate." We also have an extract (xiii.) titled "Of Hermes from the Books to Ammon," called "Of the General Economy," which also discusses Providence, Necessity, and Fate. According to Hermes, there were multiple sermons on Fate, as noted by Stobaeus, not only in the Tat literature but also in the Ammon literature. Therefore, it seems likely that in the collection used by Lactantius, the Tat sermons on Fate came right before our treatise, and one of these sermons (probably the one right before our treatise) was titled "On Justice," supporting the title I have given to the Stobaeus Extract xi.

MATERIALITY AND CORPORALITY ARE ENERGIES OF GOD

22. Finally, in section 22, it is important to note that the explicit teaching that Matter and Body are not evil but are Energies of God—His materiality and corporality—means that the accusation of dualism against our philosophers must be dismissed. Their doctrine was pan-monism. Therefore, any signs of dualism or clear dualistic statements should be seen as a formal method to emphasize the need for effort to solve the mystery of opposites, rather than an essential doctrine of their Gnosis.

1. **Tat**: In your general sermons, father, you spoke in riddles about Divinity, making it unclear. You said no man could be saved before Rebirth, but you hid the meaning. When I sought guidance from you on the mountain, you promised to teach me about Rebirth, which I do not understand, once I became a stranger to the world.

I prepared myself by distancing my thoughts from worldly illusions. Now, please complete my understanding by teaching me about Rebirth, either through speech or in a secret way. I do not know from what material or womb Man is born, or from what seed.

2. **Hermes**: Wisdom that understands in silence is the material and womb from which Man is born, and the True Good is the seed.

**Tat**: Who is the sower, father? I am completely lost.

**Hermes**: It is the Will of God, my son.

**Tat**: What kind of being is born, father? I do not possess the essence that transcends the senses. Is the one who is born another being from God, God's Son?

**Hermes**: All in all, composed of all powers.

**Tat**: You speak in riddles, father, and do not speak plainly as a father to his son.

---

This modern English version keeps the original meaning intact while making it clearer and easier to understand.This journey, my son, is not something that can be taught; rather, it is remembered by God's will. 

Tat: You speak of impossible things, Father, things that seem forced. I want clear answers. Am I not truly your son? Don't hold back from me. Explain the process of rebirth.

Her: What can I say, my son? I can only tell you this: Whenever I experience the simple vision within myself, granted by God's mercy, I transcend my former self and become part of an immortal body. I am no longer what I was; I am reborn in mind. This path cannot be taught, and it cannot be perceived by the physical senses.

Yes, my old composed form has been dismantled. I am no longer confined by touch, yet I still have a sense of touch; I have dimension, but I am now a stranger to it. You see me with your eyes, my son, but you do not truly understand what I am, even with your utmost effort.

Tat: You have driven me into a state of intense confusion, Father, for now I no longer recognize myself.

Her: I wish, my son, that you could pass through yourself, like those who dream while awake.

Tat: Who is the author of this rebirth?

Her: The Son of God, the One Man, by God's will.

Tat: You have left me in complete astonishment, Father. I am disconnected from the senses I had before, for now I see your greatness as one with your distinct form.

Her: Even in this you are mistaken; our mortal form changes daily. It grows and declines with time, as it is an impermanent thing.

Tat: What then is true, Thrice-Great One?That which is never troubled, my son, which cannot be defined; that which has no color or shape, which is not moved, which has no covering, which gives light; that which is understandable only by itself, which does not change; that which no body can contain.

Tat: Truly, father, I am losing my mind. Just when I thought I was becoming wise through you, I find my understanding blocked. 

Her: This is how it is, my son: That which rises like fire but falls like earth, that which is wet like water but moves like air—how can you understand it with your senses? It is neither solid nor moist, and nothing can bind or free it. Only in its power and energy can a man have any notion of it, and even then, it requires a man who can perceive the path to being born in God.

Tat: Am I incapable of this, father?

Her: No, God forbid, my son! Look within yourself, and it will come; desire it, and it will happen. Ignore the body's senses, and your divinity will be born; cleanse yourself of the brutish torments—things of matter.

Tat: Do I have tormentors in me, father?

Her: Yes, many, my son; and they are dreadful and numerous. 

Tat: I do not know them, father.

Her: The first torment is Not-knowing, my son; the second is Grief; the third is Intemperance; the fourth is Lust; the fifth is Injustice; the sixth is Greed; the seventh is Error; the eighth is Envy; the ninth is Deceit; the tenth is Anger; the eleventh is Recklessness; the twelfth is Malice. There are twelve in total, but there are many more under them. These torments creep through the prison of the body and cause the man inside to suffer through his senses. But they leave (although not all at once) from those who have received God's mercy, and this is the process of Rebirth.

And now, my son, be still and keep silent.The mercy we receive from God will not stop. Rejoice, my son, for God's power is purifying you to understand the Word (Logos).

When we gain knowledge of God, ignorance is expelled. Knowledge of Joy also comes to us, and with it, sorrow leaves those who allow it to. I invoke the power of Self-control that follows Joy. This sweet power should be welcomed gladly, my son! It drives away excess. 

Next, I call upon Continence, the power against desire. This step is the foundation of Righteousness. Without judgment, see how it banishes Unrighteousness. We become righteous when Unrighteousness departs. The sixth power I call upon is Sharing-with-all, which counters greed.

With greed gone, I call on Truth. As Error flees, Truth arrives. See how Goodness fills up, my son, when Truth comes. Envy leaves us; Goodness, Life, and Light join Truth. Darkness no longer torments us, having been defeated and driven away. 

Now, my son, you understand the nature of Rebirth. When the Ten powers come and drive out the Twelve, the Birth in understanding is complete, transforming us into divine beings. Those who gain this rebirth by God's mercy, abandoning physical senses, recognize themselves as beings of Light and Life and are filled with Bliss.

Tat: Strengthened by God, father, I no longer see with my physical eyes but with the energy that Mind provides through the Powers. I am in heaven, on earth, in water, air; I am in animals, in plants; I am in the womb, before the womb, after the womb; I am everywhere!But tell me this: How are the twelve torments of the Darkness driven out by the ten Powers? What is the method, Thrice-greatest one?

12. Hermes: This realm we just passed through, my son, is made up of the circle of life forms, consisting of twelve elements but unified in nature, forming a comprehensive idea. For human delusion, these elements seem separate, but in action, they are one. Rashness and Wrath, for example, cannot be separated or even distinguished. According to right reason (logos), they naturally withdraw permanently, driven out by ten powers, specifically the Ten. The Ten is what gives birth to souls. Life and Light are unified there, where the One exists from the Spirit. Thus, according to reason (logos), the One contains the Ten, and the Ten contains the One.

13. Tat: Father, I see the All, I see myself in the Mind.

Hermes: This, my son, is Rebirth—not to view things from the body's perspective (which is limited by three-dimensional space), but to understand the Sermon (Logos) on Rebirth, which I did not comment on earlier. We must not reveal this to the masses, as God Himself wills it.

14. Tat: Father, does this Body composed of the Powers ever dissolve?

Hermes: Hush, my son! Speak not of impossibilities, or you will sin and your Mind's eye will be extinguished. The natural body we perceive with our senses is far different from this essential birth. The natural body must dissolve, but the latter can never be; the natural body must die, but the essential birth is untouched by death. Do you not know you have been born as a God, Son of the One, just like me?

15. Tat: I would, Father, hear the Praise-giving hymn which you said you heard when you were at the Eight (the Ogdoad) of Powers.

Hermes:Just as the Shepherd foretold, my son, when I reached the Eighth.

It’s good that you hurry to "strike your tent," for you have been purified.

The Shepherd, the Mind of all mastery, did not pass on to me more than what was written, for he knew well that I could learn everything by myself, hear what I wished, and see all things. He left the creation of beautiful things to me; therefore, the Powers within me, as they are within everyone, burst into song.

16. Tat. Father, I want to hear and learn these things. Her. Be still, my son; listen to the Praise-giving now that keeps the soul in tune, the Hymn of Rebirth—a hymn I wouldn’t have shared so easily if you hadn’t reached the end of all. Therefore, this is not taught, but kept silent. So, my son, stand in an open place under the sky, facing the southern wind at sunset, and make your worship; do the same at sunrise, facing the east wind. Now, son, be still!

THE SECRET HYMNODY

17. Let every part of the World hear my hymn! Open, Earth! Let every gate of the Abyss open for me. Be still, Trees! I am about to praise the Lord of creation, both All and One. Heavens, open, and Winds, stay still; let God's eternal Sphere receive my word! For I will sing the praise of Him who created all; who fixed the Earth, hung up Heaven, and commanded the Ocean to provide fresh water for both inhabited and uninhabited regions to support and serve every person; who made Fire to shine for gods and humans for every action. Let us all together praise Him, exalted above the Heavens, Lord of all nature! He is the Eye of Mind; may He accept the praise of my Powers!Inner powers, join me in praising the One and All; sing with my will, all you inner powers! O blessed Knowledge, enlightened by you, I sing praises through you to the Light that only the mind can see. I find joy in the Joy of the Mind.

Sing praises with me, all you powers! Sing praises, my self-control; sing through me, my righteousness, the praises of the righteous; sing, my generosity, the praises of the All; through me, sing, Truth, the praises of Truth! Sing, O Goodness, the praises of Goodness! O Life and Light, our praises flow to you! Father, I thank you, the energy of all my powers; I thank you, O God, the power of all my energies!

Your Reason (Logos) sings your praises through me. Take back through me the All into your Reason—my reasonable offering! Thus cry the powers within me. They sing your praise, O All; they do your will. From you comes your will; to you returns the All. Accept from all their reasonable offering. Preserve the All that is within us, O Life; illuminate it, O Light; inspire it, O God.

Your Mind guides your Word, O Creator, Bestower of the Spirit upon all.

For you are God; your human creation calls out to you through Fire, through Air, through Earth, through Water, and through Spirit, through your creatures. From your Eternity, I have found praise; and in your Will, the object of my search, I have found rest. Tat: By your favor, I have seen this praise being sung, O Father; I have set it in my own world. Hermes: Say in the world that only the mind can see, my son. Tat: Yes, Father, in the world that only the mind can see; for your hymn and praise have enlightened my mind. Yet, I myself also wish to offer praise from my natural mind to God. Hermes: But not carelessly, my son. Tat: Yes, what I perceive in mind, that I express.To you, my parent who gave me life, as to God, I, Tat, offer my sincere thanks. O God and Father, you are the Lord and the Mind. Accept my offerings as you wish, for by your will, everything has been perfected.

Hermes: Offer your sacrifice, son, in a way that is pleasing to God, the Father of all. But also add, my son, "through the Word" (Logos).

Tat: Thank you, father, for teaching me to sing such hymns.

Hermes: I am happy, my son, that you have produced the good fruits of Truth, which are eternal. Now that you have learned this lesson from me, promise to keep silent about your virtue and do not reveal the method of Rebirth to anyone, so that we are not accused of falsehoods.

Both of us have paid enough attention, both I, the speaker, and you, the listener. In your mind, you have come to know yourself and our common Father.Here is the modernized and simplified version of the provided text:

Note: The references include comparisons to other texts, such as the Corpus Hermeticum, Psalms, and prophetic writings. The term "south wind" historically referred to a range from south-southeast to west.

The Spirit is described as both Light and Life. The term "poimainei" means to act as a shepherd or to feed, and "Poemandres" refers to the Shepherd of men, who provides heavenly nourishment. The "Word" or "Reason" signifies the true essence of humanity. The term "pneymatofore demioyrge" indicates a creator who bears the spirit.

COMMENTARY

ON THE TITLE

"The Secret Sermon on the Mountain" is the main title found in most manuscripts, except for one. This title seems to come from the same source as other titles in our collection. Reitzenstein (p. 193) suggests that the title may be incorrect, though he does not specify the error. He might imply that "On a Mountain" is not mentioned in the sermon—instead, "Down a Mountain" is referenced in section 1, according to his interpretation. However, we disagree with his view, as the sermon’s teachings are indeed delivered "On the Mount," which Tat has ascended to.The term "Mountain" symbolized stages of inner development. In section 9, we are specifically told that "This step (the fifth) is Righteousness' firm seat," indicating that the Mountain was seen as a series of steps, similar to those often depicted in Egyptian frescoes.

The term "Secret" (apokryfos--apocryphal) originally meant hidden or esoteric, referring to knowledge that wasn't widely circulated. This term was applied to a logos (a sermon or saying) or a collection of such sayings. For the Ancients, a logos had a similar meaning to the Sanskrit maha-vakyam ("great saying"), which today refers to the profound mystical statements of the Upanishads, like "That art thou" (Tat tvam asi). In classical antiquity, these logoi (sayings) were regarded as words of wisdom and were considered the most sacred legacies from sages to humanity. These sayings were often collected and were seen as the most sacred "deposits" (diatheikai) of various cultures. The term was later used for the Christian Bible as well.

Herodotus referred to Onomacritus, the first collector of the ancient Orphic Hymns, as a "depository of oracles" (diatheten xresmun), meaning "one who arranges," similar to the term Vyasa in Sanskrit, the supposed "author" of the Mahabharata. Such collections of logoi were generally called "deposits," sometimes meaning "testaments" as they expressed the Divine will. Strabo used this term for the Laws of Lycurgus, and it was also used by the Orphics and Pythagoreans for their sacred laws. Later, Ecclesiastical writers used it for the Canonical Books.The Orphics and Pythagoreans referred to their collections as "sacred utterances," and even Clement of Alexandria mentioned such a saying of Orpheus as "that truly sacred utterance." It is not surprising that these collections were kept secret; this practice dates back to ancient times. In Greek and Roman history, there is evidence of oracles being carefully guarded as secret scriptures or national bibles. Cicero mentions a bible of the Veii. The Athenians, during the time of their Kings, had a similar bible of sayings, and Dinarchus notes that the state's safety depended on this secret scripture. Suidas further refers to these hidden sayings as "withdrawn volumes," meaning books that were not for public reading and were considered secret or apocryphal. This secrecy extended not only to the ancient writings themselves but also to the commentaries on them, and eventually to anything related to them. By the fourth century, Themistius the rhetorician spoke of a "mass of Archaic wisdom" that was scarce and hidden from the public.

We have translated the term as "secret" to convey the correct meaning, rather than "apocryphal," which today implies a theological judgment. 

THE THREE STAGES OF PROBATION

1. In the first paragraph, Tat refers to three Stages of Probation before he is considered ready to hear the Sermon on Rebirth. The first stage is General or Preliminary Instruction, which is contained in a collection of discourses called the General Sermons.(ii) Next is the stage where Tat becomes a student of Hermes, marked by conversation or dialogue. This means Tat was allowed to ask questions. This stage is symbolically described by the phrase "epi teis tou oroys metabaseus," which is difficult to translate but seems to mean either "ascending the mountain" or "crossing over the mountain." In simple terms, Hermes was gradually guiding Tat to the highest point of intellectual understanding, symbolized by the top of the mountain. This stage was likely represented by the collection of teachings or dialogues with Tat, known as the "Diexodikoi Logoi." The term "diexodos" fundamentally means a "way through and out," a "pathway," "passage," or "means of escape." It also refers to a detailed narrative or exposition. Therefore, "diexodikos" would mean detailed or expository, while also suggesting the idea of finding a way out of ignorance.

(iii) The third stage is moral and mental purification. "Therefore, I prepared myself and made my thoughts a stranger to the world's illusions"—the error that sums up the first six vices and is driven out by truth. Stage ii may have been technically known as the stage of the Suppliant, though this is uncertain. In any case, the term should be considered in close connection with Philo's treatise "On the Contemplative Life," which likely formed Book IV of Philo's extensive work "De Legatione." The alternative title of this work was "The Suppliants."By "Suppliant," Philo means "someone who has sought refuge in God." However, here the term is used more specifically to describe the relationship between a disciple and their master. During the period of training, the master represents God, acting as the disciple's spiritual father.

THE HOLY MOUNT OF INITIATION

The term "Mountain" is commonly used symbolically in the apocalyptic literature of the time. Examples that come to mind include the "Mount of Galilee" in the Askew and Bruce Gnostic Codices, where important initiations and rites are performed by the Risen Lord; Mount Tabor in The Gospel according to the Hebrews, where "My Mother the Holy Spirit took me by one of the hairs of the head and carried me unto Mount Tabor"; the Acts of John, where John witnesses the Vision of the Spiritual Crucifixion on the Mount; The Gospel of Eve, where the Vision of the Great and Little Man is seen on the Mount; and The Shepherd of Hermas, where the Angel of Repentance takes Hermas to the Mount of Arcadia. In all these cases, the Mountain symbolizes a state of spiritual enlightenment, not a physical location.

Stage iii is interesting because of its terminology, which can be compared with teachings in the Behnesa logos:

Jesus says: "Unless you renounce the world, you will not find the Kingdom of God." Similarly, in Tat's prayer for the end of his probation: "And now fill up what is lacking in me" (ta ystere'mata anaple'ruson). This reflects the well-known concepts of the Christianized Gnosis, the Pleroma (Fullness) and Hysterema (Insufficiency).### The Birth from Above

The time has come for Tat to receive the true Mind-consciousness from his master. The Christ is to be born in his heart, and the light of the Pleroma is to shine into his innermost being. This is a New Birth, a Regeneration, or Re-birth, meaning being born from Above. Compare this to John 3:3: "Amen, Amen, I say to you; Except a man be born from Above, he cannot see the Kingdom of God." And also John 3:7: "Do not be surprised that I said to you, You must be born from Above," where the comment on a prior saying, "You must be born from Above," shows the influence of the Haggadist. Similarly, in 1 Peter 1:22-23: "Having purified your souls by obeying the Truth... being Re-born not from perishable seed, but from imperishable seed, through the Word of God, who lives and endures."

These New Testament passages are not cited to show that our Hermetic authors depended on the New Testament writers, but to illustrate how they explain each other. The doctrine of the New Birth and the Sacred Marriage was the crowning mystery of the Spiritual Way for all mystic schools of the time.

### The Virgin Birth

The secret Tat seeks to learn is the Mystery of the Birth from the Virgin Womb—the Birth of Man, the Great Mystery of Regeneration. Many examples of this key Christian teaching can be found in Gnostic writings, but it is enough to recall what the Jewish Commentator wrote in the Naassene Document (section 28), contrasting the Great Mysteries (heavenly ones) with the Little Mysteries (those of physical generation).Discussing the Mysteries of Regeneration, he writes:

"This is the Gate of Heaven and the House of God, where the Good God dwells alone. No impure person can enter; it is guarded for the spiritual. When they enter, they must shed their old selves and become bridegrooms, achieving their true manhood through the Virginal Spirit. This is the Virgin who is pregnant, conceiving and giving birth to a Son." The Christian Commentator adds: "not psychic, not fleshly, but a blessed Aeon of Aeons."

The Jewish Commentator uses Philo's language, emphasizing the Sacred Marriage and the Virginal Spirit. Similarly, our treatise describes the Womb as Silence, representing contemplation and the Great Silence, the Mother of Aeons in many Christianized Gnostic Systems. Wisdom is the Matter; the Aeon's awakening in man is the Birth of Man, the Son of God; and the Seed is the Good or Logos sown by the Father's Will. This is the Birth of Christ in man, the Great Mystery that awaits when we detach from worldly illusions. Is this Son different from God? No, says Hermes; it is the Mystery of Sameness, not Difference; it is the Pleroma, not Insufficiency—“All in all, made of all powers," the Common Fruit of the Pleroma, as the Valentinians would say. THE RACE OF THE LOGOS

It is a Race, not an individual; it is We, no longer I. This is the Race of the Logos; the Self-taught Race of Philo; or, as Hermes says: "This Race, my son, is never taught, but when He wills it, God restores its memory." This is the anamnesis of Pythagoras and Plato—the regaining of the consciousness of the Divine State; it must be self-perceived.Philo tells us:

"But for the group of devoted individuals who are constantly learning to see more deeply, let them strive to understand the true essence of existence; let them go beyond the visible sun and look upon the Light beyond, the True Sun or Logos, and never abandon this pursuit which leads to Perfect Happiness. These people engage in Divine Service, not because of tradition or advice, but because they are driven by Heavenly Love."

They belong to the Race of Elxai, the Hidden Power or Holy Spirit, the partner of Iexai, the Hidden Lord or Logos.

SELF-TAUGHT

3. Hermes cannot explain to Tat the mystery of this Birth in words, just as Isis is not allowed to reveal it openly to Horus:

"I cannot tell the story of this Birth; it is forbidden to describe the origin of your descent, O Horus, son of great power, so that the Way-of-Birth of the immortal Gods remains unknown to men"--this refers to the Mystery of the Birth of Horus. Hermes can only guide Tat towards the realization of the Blessed Vision, by entering a sublime state of consciousness himself, so that Tat is, in a sense, immersed or baptized in his master's spiritual presence, the Cup of the Mind. This method of transmitting the Power of the powers, the true Laying-on of Hands, has been discussed in several treatises. Hermes describes the change that occurs in himself when he enters a higher spiritual consciousness. He seems to "pass through himself" and transform into a Body that can never die, into the Essential or Cosmic Body that encompasses the universe. 

This process cannot be taught, as it cannot be understood through any physical experience; the adept's physical form remains unchanged. It is an internal transformation.The Birth of Christ marks the beginning of a new era; everything seems the same as before, but everything gains a new meaning. No matter how sharp our physical vision, it cannot uncover the secrets of this Mystery. As it is said, "You see me with your eyes, my son, but you do not understand what I am." Compare this with the profound Ritual of Initiation in The Acts of John:

"You will know who I am when I leave. What I appear to be, I am not; but what I truly am, you will see when you come."

Only those who have reached the Christ-state can understand it; no teaching can fully explain its nature and secrets. It must be experienced. THE NEW CREATION

Tat, who has prepared himself, is being enlightened by the power of his master. His spiritual senses are awakening; he is starting to disconnect from the physical world and no longer sees himself as he used to. But this is only the beginning; he must not only lose awareness of his physical body and perceive with his mind alone, but he must also transform himself, looking inward and seeing everything within himself. This transformation is a New Creation within the person. The Author of Rebirth, unlike the Maker of Birth, is the One Man, the Logos, the active Reason and Will of God; one creates the Immortal Body, the other forms the mortal body. THE WAY OF BIRTH IN GOD

The next sentence is unclear and its correct meaning is difficult to determine. The terms "Greatness" (to megethos) and "distinctive form" (xarakte'r) are familiar from Christian Gnostic writings. Greatness suggests the concept of Aeon; "character" or "distinctive form" typically refers to the impression from an original model, representing the form by which a person is recognized.Hermes explains the nature of Greatness or Aeon, which represents unity in diversity. Alchemically, this is the One Element, only understood by someone divine. 

7. The process of this divine Birth involves deactivating the body's senses and activating the One Sense, known as Aeonic Consciousness. This also means purging the lower nature and replacing it with Divine Energies. This is the Mystery of Repentance (metanoia), which is not just a change of mind but a complete transformation towards God. The soul's energies are directionless and can be turned into vices or virtues by human will.

8. Hermes not only explains Repentance as the conquest of Vices by Virtues but also performs a ritual to help Tat experience this transformation. The Virtues invoked are not just ideas but real substantial powers, described by the Christian Gnostics as the Aeons of the Pleroma. There is a structured numbering system: Twelve, Ten, Seven, Three, and One. The Twelve represent the Torments of Darkness, which are tormenting only to those in Error. They are twelve yet one in nature, connected to the main irrational animal natures, known as the zodiac.These divisions are not fundamental; they are merely illusions or errors that keep humans in ignorance. In practice, they are unified in keeping humans mistaken or unaware. They can be seen as one, two, three, four, or six, and can be combined and recombined in various ways. The number twelve represents the "animal soul" in humans, symbolizing their movement outward into the external world. This outward movement stops when a person repents and turns inward. The creation of the cosmos is then transformed by spiritual salvation; material existence is replaced by spiritual knowledge. Ignorance is associated with the number twelve, while knowledge is associated with the number ten, the number of perfection. The outward movement involves the multiplication of species (e.g., 3 * 4 or 2 * 6), while the return is symbolized by the number ten, comprising seven and three, where seven is the sum (3 + 4) rather than a product. Multiplication here means generating similar beings, while addition signifies enhancing the same nature to a higher level. The number ten symbolizes the birth of human souls and ultimately divine souls. Here is a list of vices and corresponding virtues mentioned in the treatise, along with a list of vices from another source:

Vices:
1. Not-knowing
2. Grief
3. Intemperance
4. Lust
5. Unrighteousness
6. Greed
7. Error
8. Envy
9. Guile
10. Anger
11. Rashness
12. Malice

Virtues:
1. Knowledge
2. Joy
3. Self-control
4. Chastity
5. Righteousness
6. Generosity
7. Truth
8. Goodness
9. Life
10. Light

Additional Vices (from another source):
1. Growth and Decline (First Zone)
2. Devising Evils (Second Zone)
3. Deceitful Desires (Third Zone)
4. Arrogance (Fourth Zone)
5. Daring and Rashness (Fifth Zone)
6. Greed (Sixth Zone)
7. Falsehood (Seventh Zone)
8. Existence (Eighth Zone)The Powers in a group. Ninth. 10. The Father. Tenth. It becomes clear that the first seven virtues are directly opposed to the first seven vices. The root of all Twelve is Ignorance. In fact, all the Twelve stem from Ignorance. They appear to be twelve distinct entities, but they are essentially one in nature; moreover, they are not just twelve but numerous (section 12). For example, Rashness and Anger are essentially the same, and the same applies to the others; the combinations are endless. This is illustrated in the "The Shepherd" treatise, where we find: Guile of the Desires (3), which combines Guile (9) and Desire (4); Device of Evils (2), which combines Guile (9) and Malice (12); Unholy Daring and Rashness (5), which combines Unrighteousness (5) and Rashness (11); and Getting Wealth by evil means (6), which combines Guile (9) and Avarice (6). Similarly, just as Anger (10) and Rashness (11) are one, so are Envy (8) and Avarice (6) merely different aspects of the same thing; and the same goes for Intemperance (3) and Desire (4), Grief (2) and Ignorance (1), etc. All these vices are rooted in Ignorance, just as the seven virtues are rooted in Knowledge or Truth. And just as Ignorance leads to vice, Knowledge or Gnosis leads to Truth. Gnosis is not the end but the beginning of the journey; the end is God or the Good. The difference between the "Poemandres" arrangement and the categories in our treatise lies in the fact that the former describes the transformation of a good man after death, while the latter outlines the path of rebirth for a living person. The categorization of Virtues (and Vices) based on the fundamental numbers of Gnosis is evident in most systems of Christian Gnostic aeonology; indeed, it was a common approach in the general Gnostic theosophy of the time.In our treatise, we have explained how to practically and ethically realize what might seem to a casual student of Gnostic aeonology as mere metaphysical theories. These concepts, however, were deeply significant to the Gnostics, representing transcendent realities rather than abstract ideas. In the Shepherd of Hermas (Vis. iii. 8, 7), similar to our treatise, there is a vision of a group of seven women, each mother to the next, symbolizing seven virtues: Faith, Continence, Simplicity, Freedom-from-Malice, Seriousness, Knowledge (Epistemé), and Love. Additionally, there are twelve maidens (Sim. xv. 1-3), each embodying a virtue: Faith, Continence, Power, Patience, Simplicity, Freedom-from-Malice, Chastity, Joy, Truth, Understanding, Harmony, and Love. Opposed to these are twelve women in dark robes representing vices: Infidelity, Incontinence, Disobedience, Error, Grief, Depravity, Wantonness, Quickness-to-Wrath, Falsehood, Folly, Slander, and Hate. Zosimus also mentions the Twelve Fates (Moirai) of Death and connects them with the Passions.

The topic is vast as it encompasses the ultimate goal of all righteous effort and true human progress. Therefore, we must pause here to avoid excessive length. For now, it is enough to note that the Ten is not only the Garment of Purity but also the Robe of Power or Glory. Ultimately, it is the Garment of Christ, the seamless Robe, for the Ten contains the One, and the One contains the Ten.The result of this powerful invocation of the Powers—meaning the full realization of the sacred rite that culminates in Hermes' consciousness and partially transfers to Tat—is that Tat begins to "see": "I see everything; I see myself in Mind." "I am in heaven, on earth, in water, in air; I am in animals, in plants; I am in the womb, before the womb, after the womb—I am everywhere" (section 11). Compare this with C.H., xi. (xii.) 22, where Hermes is taught by Mind:

"Gather within yourself all the senses of all creatures—of fire, water, dry, and moist. Imagine that you are everywhere at the same time, on earth, in the sea, in the sky; not yet born, in the womb, young, old, and dead, in the afterlife." This is a pure Egyptian formula, signifying the opening of "cosmic consciousness." This consciousness transcends our three-dimensional limitation—our physical perspective that sees things in three spatial dimensions.

THE VOW OF SILENCE

The mystery of this new birth in consciousness must remain secret; thus, Hermes has not discussed it, likely in the Expository Sermons. It must still be kept secret (section 22), making this treatise a Secret Sermon. The reason is given here and in section 22: "So that we may not be seen as slanderers (diaboloi) by the Many or the Ignorant." The exact meaning of this phrase is unclear, and I can only speculate. Those who have fully attained the wisdom of Hermes must keep silent about their power (section 22); they should never boast about their knowledge.If they did, it would only bring the Gnosis into disrepute. They would still appear as ordinary people and might often say and do things, when they were not in a higher state of consciousness, that fell below their high ideals. This would cause them to be seen as slanderers or critics of the Gnosis by the world. The New Birth is also described as the Essential Birth; it was the birth of the Essential Man, the God, Son of the One, as mentioned in other texts.

Regarding the Ogdoad:

Tat now wants to hear the Praise-giving of the Powers, which can only be sung by those who have reached the Eighth stage, known as the Ogdoad. This stage is above the Harmony or the Hebdomad of Fate. At this point, the person is free and no longer a slave. They possess the power of prophetic hymnody, as they can now hear the True Harmony of things and are beyond the Differences. This state keeps the soul in tune. Those who reach this height can always sing in harmony; it is the state of hearing Eternal Praise-giving, and they can express it infinitely, each in their own way. The concept of the Ogdoad is present in many Christian Gnostic systems, especially in the Valentinian tradition, which includes many Egyptian elements. In the Excerpts from Theodotus, attached to the writings of Clement of Alexandria, we read:

"The one whom the Mother brings to birth is led unto Death and the world; but the one whom Christ brings to rebirth is changed into Life, unto the Ogdoad."

Christian Gnostics used many names for the Ogdoad, such as the Jerusalem Above, Wisdom, the Land flowing with milk and honey, the Holy Spirit, the Land of the Lord, and the Mesotes. Most of these terms, except for the last, were Jewish synonyms; the term Ogdoad itself was likely Egyptian.In one of the Magic Papyri, we read:

"Knowing the book's power, you should hide it, my son. It contains the True Name, which is the Name Ogdoad, who arranges and regulates everything."

A HYMN FOR MORNING AND EVENING PRAYER

The following hymn should be kept secret. Tat should use it as a model for his private prayers, likely replacing an older form of prayer he had been using, as was customary in such communities. The instruction to use it at sunrise and sunset, outdoors, reminds us of the passages added to "The Shepherd" treatise, which state:

"And when evening came and the sun's rays began to set, I instructed them all to give thanks to God."

Philo also tells us about the Therapeuts:

"Twice a day, at dawn and evening, they pray; at sunrise, they pray for the true Sunshine to fill their minds with Heavenly Light, and at sunset, they pray that their soul, freed from the desires of the senses, may return to its own community to seek Truth."

Similarly, Apollonius of Tyana is said to have prayed and meditated three times a day: at daybreak, at noon, and at sunset. Regarding the practice of "keeping silence on their virtue," we learn about the Later Pythagoreans, of whom he was a prominent example:

"They particularly observed the rule of silence regarding Divine Service. They heard many divine and indescribable things within themselves, which they found difficult to keep silent about, had they not learned that this Silence was speaking to them."The hymn should be listened to in silence; all earthly noises must cease for the Heavenly Harmony to be heard. It is noted that in four out of the five manuscripts, the title "Secret Hymnody" is followed by "Logos IV." Reitzenstein believes that the three prior "Logoi" were:

1. "Holy art Thou, O God"--C.H., i. 31, 32.
2. "The Glory of all things is God"--C.H., iii. (iv.).
3. "Whither stumble ye, sots?"--C.H., vii. (viii.).

However, the latter two are not hymns; the only other hymn in our collection is:

"Who then may sing Thee praise of Thee?"--C.H., v. (vi.) 10, 11.

Our hymn is a Hymn to the Sun, but to the Spiritual Sun, not the physical sun. It is directed to the Eye of the Mind--the All-seeing Light. This Eulogy is not a formal Te Deum, but a powerful praise-giving. All of nature should resonate with the joy of this gratitude. 

This Song of Praise is very beautiful, especially these words:

"Thy Reason sings through me Thy praises. Take back through me the All into Thy Reason--my reasonable offering! From Thee Thy Will; to Thee the All!"

The Outbreathing of the Universe through the Reason or Logos is the realization of God's Will. The Logos is Son, Will is Mother, and God is Father. The Inbreathing of the Universe is through Man ("Thy Man thus cries to Thee," section 20): "Take back through Me the All." This happens first by sacrificing man's limited reason to the Great Reason of all things. Yet, the Universe itself is not separate from God; it is all God. "From Thee Thy Will"; You are the Source of everything. "To Thee the All"; You are the End of everything, the Desirable One, The Good.Compare this with the Hymn in the Jewish section of the Naassene Document:

"From You comes Father, and Through You Mother, the two Immortal Names, Parents of Aeons, You who have Heaven as your City, O Man of Mighty Names!" Also note: "Preserve all that is in us, O Life; O Light, illuminate it; O God, inspire it!" And compare it with section 12, which states: "While Life and Light are unified there, where the One exists from the Spirit."

The Prayer is for the Baptism of Light—Illumination through Gnosis; this was the immersion in the Mind of "The Cup" treatise, similar to how true Baptism in early Christianity was called Illumination or enlightenment. "THROUGH THE WORD"

Tat now feels moved to offer praises himself. He expresses what he feels. His master has given him the inspiration and created the conditions for him to be seen as a Child of God, a Prophet. However, he has not yet grown into the full stature of a true Seer. His higher nature has received the seed, but it needs time to develop, and only gradually will its power influence his lower mind. For now, he expresses his gratitude to his master, who has performed the theurgic rite of initiation ("All things have been perfected") for him. But Hermes restrains him; his thanks should be directed not to the master, but to God. And if he cannot yet thank God directly, then let him send those thanks—"acceptable offerings"—to God "Through the Word." This practice is common in Christianity, as seen in 1 Peter 2:5: "Spiritual offerings acceptable to God through Jesus Christ." Tat has now moved from being a Hearer to a Knower; he is now a true Gnostic: "You have become a Knower of yourself, and of our Father." Compare this with saying 2 of the newly discovered Sayings at Oxyrhynchus:

"(Strive therefore?)"Know yourselves, and you will realize you are the children of the Almighty Father. You will understand that you are in the City of God, and that you are the City.

CORPUS HERMETICUM XIV. (XV.) [A LETTER] OF THRICE-GREATEST HERMES TO ASCLEPIUS

TO ASCLEPIUS, GOOD HEALTH OF SOUL! [*1]

(Text: P. 128-134; Pat. 49, 50.) 1.Since you were away, my son Tat wanted to learn about the nature of things and insisted that I teach him immediately, as he was eager to understand each point. I had to explain more to him so that he could follow the concepts more easily.

I will now summarize the key points for you, explaining them in a more mystical way, as you are older and well-versed in nature. If all visible things have been made and are being made, and if made things are created by something else, and if these made things are all different and not alike, then there must be someone who makes them. This maker cannot be made; He must be more ancient than the things that can be made. The things that owe their existence to being made cannot be older than the one who makes them.

Thus, He is the Supreme, the One, and the Only, the truly wise one, as nothing is more ancient than Him. He rules over the number, size, and differences of the things being made, as well as their continuous creation. Things that can be made are visible; but He cannot be seen. He makes things so that He remains unseen. Therefore, He is always creating and can never be seen.

Understanding Him in this way is proper. By understanding, you should marvel; by marveling, you should feel blessed to have learned to know your Father. For what is sweeter than knowing your true Father? So, who is He, and how can we learn to know Him?Is it not right to call Him alone God, Maker, or Father, or even all three; God for His Power, Maker for His Energy, and Father for His Goodness? Power is different from the things being made, while Energy is present in all things being made. Therefore, we should avoid unnecessary words and understand these two concepts: the made and the Maker. There is no middle ground; there's no third option.

So, in everything you think of or hear, remember these two: the made and the Maker. All things are either one or the other, and it's impossible for one to exist without the other. The Maker cannot exist without the made, and vice versa, because they are essentially one and the same. They cannot be separated any more than you can separate yourself from yourself.

If the Maker is nothing but the one who makes, simple and uncompounded, it must make for itself, meaning its making is its being made.

As for everything being made, it can't make itself; it must be made by something else. Without the Maker, the made neither exists nor is made, because each loses its nature without the other. If all things are accepted to be two—the made and the Maker—then they are one in their union: the leader and the follower. The making God is the leader, and whatever is being made is the follower.And do not be hesitant about the variety of things made, fearing that it might reflect poorly on God's glory. His glory lies in creating everything, which can be seen as God's handiwork.

The Creator does not consider anything bad or inferior. Such negative aspects are side effects of the creation process, like rust on brass or dirt on a body. Just as a brass-smith does not create rust, and parents do not create dirt on their child's body, God does not create evil. It is the ongoing process of being created that causes things to deteriorate. For this reason, God has instituted change, like a cleansing process for creation.

Is it possible for a single painter to create images of heaven, gods, earth, sea, people, animals, and plants, but impossible for God to create all things? This shows a great lack of understanding and knowledge of God.

Some people, despite claiming to worship and praise God, fail to recognize Him as the creator of everything. This ignorance leads them to the worst impiety, attributing negative emotions, arrogance, or impotence to God. If God did not create everything, it would imply arrogance or inability, which is blasphemous to think.

God has only one attribute: Goodness. And being good, He is neither arrogant nor impotent. This is God—the Good, who has the power to create everything.

Everything that can be made is made by God, who is the Good and has the power to create all things.

If you wish to understand how He creates and how things are made, you can learn this.Observe a farmer planting seeds in the ground—here wheat, there barley, and elsewhere other seeds. See the same man planting vines, apple trees, and other trees. Similarly, God sows Immortality in Heaven, Change on Earth, and Life and Motion in the universe. These are not many but are few and easy to count; there are four in total—God Himself, and Genesis, in whom all things exist.

^257:1 ey fronein. The exact meaning of this expression is unclear. Everard translates it as "to be truly wise"; Parthey, following Patrizzi, translates it as "recte sapere"; Menard as "sagesse"; Chambers as "to be rightly wise." It may have been a greeting among these disciples of the Inner Way, wishing each other wisdom and good thought, rather than happiness.

^258:1 This means more fully and profoundly, as to someone more advanced in mystic science.
^259:1 Cf. C. H., xvi. 18.
^260:1 tun en myxui. The exact meaning of this expression is unclear. Everard translates it as "things that are in darkness or secret"; Parthey as "quae sunt in abdito"; Menard as "in the depths"; Chambers as "those in secrecy." The term myxos, generally signifying a closed or locked place, may refer to symbolic expressions used by Pherecydes to signify "the births and deaths of souls," though the exact meaning is uncertain.The "birth" and "death" of a soul likely refer to its entry into the world from the World-soul and its return to the great Mother. This suggests that things exist in two states: an active state of change and a passive state, which Indian philosophers call laya or pralaya. For more on this, see Pherecydes' fragments by Sturz (Leipzig, 1824). 

From here to the end of the sermon, except for some parts of sections 7, 9, and 10, and with minor variations, this is quoted by Cyril in Contra Julianum, ii. 64 (Migne, col. 598 D). 

COMMENTARY

ASCLEPIUS AND TAT

Fabricius, in his Bibliotheca Graeca, suggests the title should be "On the Nature of the All," claiming this from Cyril, but I cannot confirm this. This treatise is a letter, different from previous ones, and belongs to the Asclepius-Tat tradition. In C. H., x. (xi.): "Yesterday's discourse was for you, Asclepius, so today’s is for Tat." Tat, the younger, has just begun to understand the teachings. This likely means he has recently been allowed to participate in the "Expository Sermons." C. H., x. (xi.) 1, says: "This is the summary of the General Sermons he has heard."Asclepius is older and well-versed in the study of nature. Understanding the exact meaning behind these personifications is challenging. However, the same ideas, whatever they may be, are clearly mentioned in K K. (Stob., Ecl., i. 49; p. 386, 24 W.); especially the later addition of "Asclepius" to the School, and the fact that "Tat," due to his youth, could not have passed on the tradition of complete contemplation—that is, of learning or knowledge, or in other words, the "learning of the things that are, the contemplating of their nature and the knowing of God" (C. H., i. 3); or the "being taught the nature of everything and the Supreme Vision" (ibid., 27). This view of the School's tradition seems to conflict with another view in C. H., xiii. (xiv.), where Tat has passed on the "manner of Rebirth," but a probable explanation has already been attempted in the "Prolegomena," chapter xvi: "The Disciples of Thrice-greatest Hermes." [p. 265]

COMPARE WITH "MIND UNTO HERMES"

The treatise itself needs little commentary; however, the similarity of its doctrine with that of the "Mind unto Hermes" is remarkable. For example, compare the last sentence of section 7 of our treatise with C. H., xi. (xii.) 14: "For indeed He has no one else to share in what He works, for working by Himself, He is always at work, being what He does." Compare also the first sentence of section 8 with C. H., xi. (xii.) 20: "Look at the power and swiftness you have! And can you do all these things, and God not do them?" THE GOOD HUSBANDMAN

With the Good Husbandman "image" (section 10) compare:

"Come to me, Good Husbandman, Good Spirit, Harpocrates, Chnouphis . . . who rolls down the stream of the Nile, and merges with the Sea . . . as man with woman."In the Alchemical literature:

"Come, and as you come, contemplate and inquire of Acharantus, the Farmer. Learn from him what is sown and what is harvested. You will discover that if you sow corn, you will reap corn, and if you sow barley, you will reap barley."

Similarly, Zosimus in the "Book Concerning the Logos" says:

"And to show you I speak the truth, I call Hermes as my witness. He says: Go to Achaab, the Farmer, and you will learn that he who sows corn produces corn."

CORPUS HERMETICUM (XVI.) THE DEFINITIONS OF ASCLEPIUS TO KING AMMON

THE PERFECT SERMON OF ASCLEPIUS TO THE KING

(Text: R. 348-354; Pat. at end.)

1. This is a great sermon (logos) I send to you, O King. It is a summary and digest of all the others. It is not meant to please the majority, as it contains much that refutes common beliefs. It may even seem to contradict my other sermons. Hermes, my master, often said in our conversations, both alone and sometimes with Tat present, that those who read my books will find their composition simple and clear. However, because the deeper meaning is hidden, it will become even less clear when the Greeks try to translate our language into theirs, distorting and obscuring what is already written.

2. In our own language, the sermon keeps the meaning of the words clear.Due to the unique quality of their sound, the power of Egyptian names can bring about the very actions they describe. Therefore, O King, since you have the power to do all things, please keep our sermon from being translated. This is to prevent these powerful mysteries from reaching the Greeks, whose language, with all its superficial beauty and looseness, might diminish the solemn and strong nature of these names. The Greeks are known for their argumentative words, and their philosophy often amounts to mere noise. In contrast, we use sounds filled with meaning and action.

Now, I will begin the sermon by invoking God, the universal Lord and Creator, who is both the Father and Encompasser of all. Though He is All, He is also One, and though He is One, He is also All. The fullness of all things is One and in One, not as a second entity but as a unified One. This is the concept I want you to keep in mind throughout our sermon, Sire. If one tries to separate what is both All and One, they will misunderstand the concept of fullness, which cannot be divided. Separating All from One would destroy the essence of All.

All things must be One if they are indeed One. They are One and will always remain One to preserve the fullness.

Look at the Earth, where you can see many sources of water and fire emerging from its core. In the same space, you can observe the three visible elements—fire, water, and earth—all originating from one root. Therefore, it is believed to be the treasury of all matter.It sends forth its abundance and, in return, receives sustenance from above.

For this is how the Creator—meaning the Sun—eternally arranges Heaven and Earth. It pours down essence and takes up matter, drawing all things around and to itself, and giving everything to all. Its beneficial energies extend not only through Heaven and the Air but also onto Earth, reaching the lowest depths and the Abyss. 

If there is an essence that only the mind can grasp, this is its substance, with its reservoir being its Light.

But only it knows where this substance arises or flows from.

In space and nature, it is close to itself, though it is not seen by us. We must understand it by conjecture.

The sight of it, however, is not left to conjecture. Its rays, in their greatest splendor, shine all around on the entire Cosmos above and below. It is established in the midst, surrounded by the Cosmos. Like a skilled charioteer, it safely drives the cosmic team and keeps them close to itself, preventing chaotic disorder. The reins are Life, Soul, Spirit, Immortality, and Creation.

It drives them near to itself, or rather, together with itself. In this way, it operates all things. To the immortals, it grants perpetual permanence. With the upper hemisphere of its own Light—everything it sends above from its side facing Heaven—it nourishes the deathless parts of the Cosmos.But with the side that sends down its Light and shines over the entire hemisphere of Water, Earth, and Air, He brings life and keeps animals in these lower parts of the Cosmos moving through births and changes. 

He transforms them in a spiral manner, changing one species into another, balancing their mutual transformations—similar to how He deals with the Great Bodies. For every body, permanence consists of transformation. If a body is immortal, it does not dissolve; if it is mortal, it is accompanied by dissolution.

This is how an immortal body differs from a mortal one. Moreover, as His Light is continuous, so is His Power of giving life, without end in space or abundance. There are many groups of daimons around Him, like various hosts. Though they live with mortals, they are close to the immortals, overseeing human affairs and carrying out the Gods' plans—through storms, whirlwinds, hurricanes, fire transformations, earthquakes, famines, and wars, punishing human impiety, which is the greatest offense against the Gods.

The duty of the Gods is to provide benefits; the duty of mankind is to offer worship; and the duty of the daimons is to deliver retribution. Other actions men do through error, recklessness, necessity (which they call Fate), or ignorance are not punishable by the Gods; only impiety is judged.

The Sun is the preserver and nurturer of every class.And just as the Intelligible World, embracing the Sensible World, fills it completely with various forms and shapes, the Sun fills the Cosmos, giving life to everything and strengthening them. When things are tired or failing, the Sun rejuvenates them. 

13. Under the Sun is a choir of daimons, or rather, choirs, because there are many and they are diverse. They are organized under the groups of Stars, each matching the number of stars. These daimons serve each Star and have different natures—some good, some bad, and some mixed—depending on their activities, as a daimon's essence is defined by its actions.

14. These daimons have authority over earthly matters and cause the various turmoils and confusions on Earth, affecting both nations and individuals. They shape our souls to be like themselves and influence our bodies, affecting our nerves, marrow, veins, arteries, brain, and even our hearts.

15. When each of us is born, the daimons present at that moment of our birth take hold of us. These daimons are aligned with the stars, which change constantly and never remain the same. They descend into our bodies and influence the two parts of our soul, each driving it towards its own activity. However, the rational part of our soul is above the daimons' influence and is meant to be a receptacle for God.

16. A person who has a divine Ray shining within their rational part is unaffected by the daimons. There are very few such people, and no daimon or even a god has power against a single Ray of God.All humans are influenced and controlled, both in mind and body, by spiritual beings (daimons), loving and hating according to these influences. Reason and logic are not the love that deceives or is deceived.

These daimons manage the entirety of earthly affairs, using our bodies as their tools. This management is referred to by Hermes as Heimarmene.

The Intelligible World depends on God, and the Sensible World depends on the Intelligible World. The Sun, through both the Intelligible and Sensible Cosmos, abundantly distributes the goodness from God, which is the act of creation. Surrounding the Sun are the Eight Spheres: the Sphere of the Fixed Stars, the Six Planets, and one Earthly Sphere. From these spheres come the daimons, and from the daimons come humans. Thus, everything ultimately depends on God.

God is the Father of all, the Sun is their Creator, and the Cosmos is the tool of creation. The Intelligible Essence governs Heaven; Heaven governs the Gods; and the daimons, ranked below the Gods, govern humans. This is the hierarchy of Gods and daimons.

Through these intermediaries, God creates everything for Himself. All things are parts of God, and therefore, God is everything. By creating all things, He creates Himself, and He never stops creating because He is eternal.

Just as God has no beginning or end, His act of creation also has no beginning or end.Here is the simplified and modernized version of the text:

Compare C. H., x. (xi.) 2. ^269:6 Compare P. S. A., xxix. 4. ^269:7 Literally, "bringing or drawing down;" "katagein" = "to deduce" or "elicit"—often used in the context of magic arts. ^269:8 "noete ousia" = "intelligible essence." ^269:9 "ogkos" = mass, bulk, volume; in later philosophy, it means "atom," and might mean that here, in a philosophical and mystical sense, not a physical one. ^269:10 "ypodoxe" = "receptacle." ^270:1 The text is very corrupt. Patrizzi translates: "Or because in that place and nature existing near itself, not visible to us, forces us to understand through conjecture"—which does not represent the Greek accurately. Menard suggests: "To understand by induction what is hidden from our view, we need to be near it and similar to its nature." Reitzenstein identifies two gaps in the text but does not try to fill them. As the text stands, translating it is nearly impossible. ^270:2 Literally, "his very sight"--"ayte e opsis," meaning his rays, with "opsis" referring to visual rays thought to come from the eyes according to the science of that time.

See "The Perfect Sermon." ^270:4 Literally, "car" or "chariot"--"arma." ^270:5 Literally.### Commentary on the Title

Patrizzi combined sections (xvi.) and (xvii.) under the title "Definitions of Asclepius--Book I." However, he observed that section (xvii.) did not belong to section (xvi.), noting, "the following sections appear to be taken from another book."

This text is derived from "Thrice-Greatest Hermes, Vol. 2," by G.R.S. Mead, published in 1906 and available at sacred-texts.com.Here’s a modernized and simplified version of the text provided:

---

Sections 1-10, titled "Definitions of Asclepius--Book II," and sections 11-16, titled "D. of A.--Book III," don't actually match their titles. In the manuscripts, a later hand added a content list under the general title, which includes:

"Of God; Matter; Evil; Fate; the Sun; Intelligible Essence; Divine Essence; Man; the Economy of the Pleroma; the Seven Stars; the Man after the Likeness." However, this list seems largely irrelevant, and Patrizzi substituted it with the title: "Of the Sun and Daimons." Reitzenstein believes that this content list, and similar headings elsewhere, were added by a Byzantine scribe, who also mistakenly inserted some content.

Even for section 16, the title "Definitions of Asclepius" seems unsuitable. On the other hand, we find Lactantius referring to the "incursions of daimons," claiming it was also a doctrine of Hermes, and adding:

"Asclepius, his student, explained this idea in greater detail in the 'Perfect Sermon' he wrote to the King." This statement is clear, and Lactantius' authority might be more reliable than the manuscripts. However, since the title would conflict with "The Perfect Sermon" of Hermes to Asclepius, and considering Lactantius might have meant "in that introductory sermon," using the term "perfectus" in a general sense, I've kept the traditional title and added Lactantius' title as a secondary option.

A TRADITION ABOUT THE TRISMEGISTIC LITERATURE

1. Similar to "The Key" (C. H., x. (xi.)) of Hermes, our treatise is a summary. Asclepius had written several Sermons to the King. References to "Conversations" between Hermes, Asclepius, and Tat—sometimes with both present, sometimes with just Asclepius—suggest that such Dialogues existed and that the Correspondence of Asclepius with the King came later in our literature.This literary work of Asclepius claims in its introduction to be authorized by Hermes, and it also suggests that it was originally written in Demotic Egyptian. In other words, the writer wants us to believe that the Greek version is a translation from Egyptian. However, this is clearly not the case, and we can conclude that the "prophecy" of direct translation is a literary fiction created by the author. 

On the other hand, it is very likely that the author was aware of a tradition that the teachings of Hermes were originally Egyptian and that these teachings were adapted into Greek thought rather than directly translated into Greek. Regardless, the author's disdain for the Greek language and philosophy, along with his admiration for Hieroglyphic Egyptian as a "language of the Gods"—a magical language that, through its power, made the listener understand by connecting them with the ideas represented by the symbols or the "names of power"—shows that he was neither Greek nor a lover of Greek philosophy. This is quite puzzling, considering that most of the writers of these texts were clearly devoted students and admirers of Plato, and the author of this text writes in a similar style.

All of this suggests that in his introduction, the author was using some existing tradition about the ancient Thoth-literature for his own purposes. A version of this tradition was also used by Philo of Byblus in the first century when he claimed that the Phoenician priest Sanchuniathon discovered the origins of Phoenician cosmogony and mystery-teaching in the Books of Taautos, "whom the Egyptians called Thoyth, the Alexandrians Thoth, and the Greeks changed into Hermes."Sanchuniathon says that he found secret writings from the Temples of Ammon that were not widely known. He studied these writings himself and learned about various subjects.

Philo claims to quote one of the earliest priests of Phoenicia, named Thabion. Thabion allegedly got his information from a writing by the Seven Kabiri and Asclepius, a student of Taautos. Thabion said that Taautos was made King of Egypt by Kronos, also known as Ammon.

Here, we encounter traditions about Thoth-Hermes, his ancestors, students, and secret writings. Many such traditions existed and were adapted by Hellenistic writers for their purposes. Another tradition involved a King Ammon, mentioned by Jamblichus, who wrote:

"Hermes first taught the Path to God. Bitys, the Prophet, translated Hermes' teachings for King Ammon, finding them in an inscription in the sacred characters at Sais in Egypt."

Both our author and Jamblichus agree that secret teachings of Hermes were hidden in the inner shrines of temples and translated into the contemporary Egyptian language for King Ammon. Our author seems to follow this tradition, implying he was writing in a similar style. The identity of King Ammon is uncertain, but it seems likely that the translations by Bitys were related to Manetho's translation work for King Ptolemy, which was into Greek.Our author, however, attributes the treatise to an Egyptian King, trying to lend it the authority of ancient origins.

A GUESS ABOUT THE DATE

What sets our treatise apart from others is its emphasis on the Sun as the Demiurgic Orderer of everything. This pantheistic form of Sun-worship is distinctly Egyptian.

Considering the dismissive tone towards Greek philosophy in the introduction, one might think the phrase, "And if there be any essence which the mind alone can grasp" (section 6), is a condescending nod to the Greek concept of the Intelligible World, as well as the analogy in section 12. But in sections 17 and 18, the text fully embraces the doctrine of the Intelligible and Sensible Worlds. This contradiction suggests that the introduction might have been written by someone else, and the main sermon starts at section 3. Still, the sermon is addressed to a King— "The Perfect Sermon to the King" mentioned by Lactantius—without specifying who this King was historically, leaving it all up to speculation.

Reitzenstein points out in section 7 that the symbolism of the Sun as a charioteer with a crown of rays matches the imagery of the Aurelian Sun-god and the Roman Empire-god of the third century. While this similarity is acknowledged, using it to date our document is problematic. The symbolism of the Sun as a ray-crowned charioteer is also central to the cult of Mithras and appeared in Greece long before the Aurelian period.**The Description of the Sun**

It is interesting to note that the Sun is described as "surrounded by the cosmos," and to compare this with a passage about the Macro-prosopus in the Untitled Apocalypse of the Coptic Gnostic Codex Brucianus, especially the sentence: 

"The Hair of His Head represents the Hidden Worlds, and the Outline of His Face symbolizes the Aeons."

In this Untitled Apocalypse, there is a strong Egyptian influence. The idea of a crown of powers, which is prominently Egyptian, can also be found in many passages of the Pistis Sophia. Additionally, the description of the Sun in section 8 reminds us of the Orphic Phanes, especially the reference to the two hemispheres above and below, similar to the two parts of the Egg in Orphic symbolism. 

The suggestion that the sun's energy moves in a spiral or serpentine fashion in animals, and that this is also true for celestial bodies or Great Animals, is intriguing.

**Concerning the Daimones**

The author then explains his doctrine of the daimones or servants of the Gods, who operate in the lower hemisphere, from the Earth to the Sun, while the Gods presumably operate in the higher hemisphere. These daimones are similar to what a Hindu or Buddhist would call karmic agents, as they are connected with what is known as the Fate-Sphere, the Wheel of Genesis, or Samsara.

These daimones govern the lower energies of the soul; the higher energy or rational part of the soul is above them and is meant to be the "receptacle of God," or rather His Ray, which is the Mind.

In section 16, compare the remarkable passage in one of Valentinus's Letters:

"Only one is Good, whose true expression is manifested through His Son; it is through Him alone that the heart can become pure, once every evil essence has been expelled from it."The text's original meaning has been preserved while updating the language and simplifying the text:

---

The heart's purity is compromised by various influences that inhabit it, each performing its own actions and corrupting it with improper desires. From my perspective, the heart is like an inn with holes and gaps in its walls, often filled with filth, where people live carelessly as if it belongs to someone else. This is how the heart remains, unclean and home to many demons, as long as no care is taken.

But when the One Good Father looks upon it, the heart is sanctified and shines with light; anyone with such a heart is blessed and "shall see God."

Valentinus’s language is very similar to that of our writings; Valentinus himself was an Egyptian.

The scheme of dependency in section 17 is also entirely Egyptian, as we've noted several times, quoting from a hymn of Valentinus. The statement, "Therefore God is the Father of all; the Sun's Demiurge," clearly contradicts Reitzenstein's statement that the Sun in our treatise is worshipped as the All-god. The Sun is He "by whom all things are made," the Creative Logos of God.

The treatise is evidently incomplete; however, if we look at the contents title at the beginning of these comments, we gain little information about what is missing. The contents listed do not match the substance of our treatise in any clear way, nor do the subjects appear in the same order. The Divine Essence, Man, the Economy of the Pleroma, and the Man after the Likeness, which are not covered in our text, may have been discussed in the missing portion of our tractate. This is all we can infer.

Now, from the "Corpus Hermeticum (XVII.) [Of Asclepius to the King]":

Asclepius: "If you think about it, O King, even bodies can have aspects that are bodiless."

The King: "What do you mean?" asked the King.

Asclepius: "The bodies that appear in mirrors—don't they seem to have no physical form?"

The King: "That's true, Asclepius; you think like a god!" replied the King.

Asclepius: "There are other bodiless things as well, like forms. Don't they seem to have no physical body but appear in both living and non-living things?"

The King: "You speak wisely, Asclepius."

Asclepius: "Therefore, there are reflections of bodiless things on bodies, and of bodies on bodiless things. This means there are reflections of the physical world on the spiritual world and vice versa. So, honor the images, O King, as they too have their forms originating from the spiritual world."The King. It is time, O Prophet, to ensure the comfort of our guests. Tomorrow, we will continue our sacred discussion.

COMMENTARY

ON THE ADORATION OF IMAGES

The end of the previous sermon and almost all of the seventeenth sermon are missing, likely due to the loss of one or more sections from the original manuscript. This is similar to what happened with another part of the text. 

Interestingly, Reitzenstein noted that one of the correctors of a copy of this flawed original manuscript (the Paris manuscript) changed the name Asclepius to Tat in these missing sections. He thought he was correcting an error, but it actually added to the confusion. We can only guess what the main topic of our treatise was, but part of it likely explained the reasoning behind image worship: "Why worship images, O King?" These symbolic images of the Gods are said to have their forms (ideas) in a sympathetic relationship with the Intelligible World, reflecting each other.In modern English, the text could be simplified and corrected as follows:

Since the spirit (Ka) of the God was believed to be closely connected to the image of the God, and the Gods belonged to the Intelligible World, the statues of the Gods were considered special representations of this image. These statues were thought to provide a direct link between Earth and Heaven, much like a person who emulated the divine form became a pathway to the divine.

[p. 288]

CORPUS HERMETICUM (XVIII.) [THE ENCOMIUM OF KINGS]

(ABOUT THE SOUL BEING HINDERED BY THE BODY'S PASSIONS)

(Text: R. 355-360; Pat. at the end.)

1. In the case of those practicing the harmonious art of music, if the disharmony of the instruments disrupts their intent during a performance, it becomes laughable. If the instruments are too weak for what is required, the musician will be mocked by the audience. Despite the musician's best efforts, they will be blamed for the weakness. However, the Divine Musician-God, who not only creates the harmony of celestial songs but also sends the rhythm of his melody down to individual instruments, is never weary because God does not grow tired.

2. Therefore, if a musician wants to perform at the highest level of their art, and if the trumpeters have played the same phrase as the composer, followed by the flautists playing sweet notes on their instruments, and the music is then completed with pipe and plectrum, any mistakes should not be blamed on the inspiration of the composer.No, by no means. We give the musician the respect he deserves; we blame the faulty instrument for hindering even the most skilled musicians, disrupting their performance, and depriving listeners of the song's beauty.

Similarly, in our case, let no one blame our human weaknesses on our entire race. Understand that God is an Unwearied Spirit, always consistent in His wisdom and generous gifts.

If the craftsman, the Demiurge, cannot perfect his work due to insufficient materials, even though he has done his best, we should not blame him. Instead, we should blame the instrument's flaws, whether it is too loose or too tight, disrupting the harmony.

When a mishap occurs because of the instrument, no one blames the artist. In fact, the worse the instrument, the more the artist is admired for still managing to strike the correct notes, and the more listeners appreciate him without blaming him. So we, too, should tune our inner selves to align with the Musician.

I have seen an artist who, even without the ability to play the lyre, used himself as an instrument after being trained in a noble theme. He tuned his inner strings through mysteries, astonishing listeners with how he turned necessity into magnificence.

You surely know the story of the harper who earned the favor of the God who oversees music.One day, while he was playing in a competition and a string on his instrument broke, the favor of a higher power provided him with another string, granting him the gift of fame. A grasshopper landed on his lyre, filling in for the broken string through the foresight of this higher power.

Thus, the breaking of the string no longer troubled the musician, and he won fame and victory. I feel this is similar to my own situation, esteemed Sirs! Recently, I confessed my lack of strength and appeared weak for a moment, but now, through the strength given by the Superior One, it is as if my song about the King has been perfected by Him, awakening my inspiration. Our duty will result in the glorious fame of Kings, and our discussion will focus on their triumphs. Let us proceed with enthusiasm! The singer is ready and has tuned his lyre for this; he will play more sweetly and sing more fittingly, as he has great subjects for his song.

Since his lyre is specially tuned to honor Kings and he aims to sing their praises, let him first honor the highest King—God. Starting his song from above, he then descends to those on earth who wield power like Him. Kings prefer that songs begin from the highest point and gradually descend, reflecting the source of their victories and leading their hopes step by step.Let's begin with praising God, the greatest King of all, who is eternally free from death, forever powerful, and the source of all victories. From Him, victories flow to those who achieve them in turn.

Our discussion now moves to praising the earthly kings and leaders who ensure the common good and peace. These kings were appointed by God in ancient times to hold the highest authority. Their rewards and honors were prepared even before they proved themselves in battle. They are destined not only to be kings but also to be the best.

Even before they act, other nations tremble at their power.

(BLESSING THE GREATER ONE AND PRAISING THE KING)

Now, let's conclude our discussion by returning to the blessing of the Greater One, and finish by praising those divine kings who bring us the great prize of peace. Just as we started by acknowledging the Greater One and the Supreme Power, we will end by honoring the same Greater One.Just as the Sun, the caretaker of all growing things, gathers the first fruits of their yield with his powerful rays at sunrise—those rays acting like his hands to harvest the most delightful essences of plants—we should also start with the Supreme Being. Receiving His wisdom, we should direct it to nourish the garden of our souls above the heavens. We should then return these streams of blessings back to their source, acknowledging that He has poured the power of growth into us.

It is fitting to use countless tongues and voices to send blessings back to the pure God, the Father of our souls. Although we cannot adequately express His glory—since we are not capable—we will say what we can. Just as newborns do not have the strength to sing their Father's glory perfectly, they still give sincere thanks according to their ability and are forgiven for their weakness.

Indeed, God's glory is found in the fact that He is greater than His children, and the beginning, middle, and end of blessings is to acknowledge the Father as infinitely powerful and limitless.

Similarly, in the case of a King, we, as his children, feel it is our duty to praise him. We must still ask for forgiveness for our shortcomings, even though it is granted by our Father before we ask.

Just as a Father does not turn away from his newborns because they are weak but rejoices when they begin to recognize his love, so too does the Gnosis of the all rejoice. It distributes life to all and gives us the power to bless God, which He has given us.For God, being inherently good and possessing eternal perfection, is immortal and holds an endless inheritance. Flowing forever from His energy, He sends messages to this world urging us to offer praise, which brings us closer to Him.

With God, there is no favoritism or partiality; everyone is united in thought, guided by a shared understanding. Their collective mind is their Father, and their mutual passion fosters harmony. It is Love that unites everything.

Therefore, let us praise God. But first, let us honor those who have received authority from Him, starting with our Kings. By practicing respect and praise for them, we train ourselves in piety and prepare to offer praise to God. This practice helps us develop our devotion to both God and our Kings.

We should express gratitude to our Kings for providing us with great peace. The virtue and very name of the King establish peace. A King is called so because he harmonizes conflicts and embodies reason that promotes peace. By becoming the protector of a kingdom that is not originally his, his name symbolizes peace. The mere mention of the King’s name has often deterred enemies.Even more, the very statues of the King provide peaceful refuge for those in the greatest distress. Just the King's likeness needs to appear to secure victory and ensure all citizens are free from harm and fear.

**Commentary**

**The Apology of a Poemandrist**

This final piece in our collection stands out significantly in both style and content from the rest of the sermons, indicating a different kind of effort. The style is often highly artificial and forced, making it clear that considerable labor and effort were involved. Sometimes, the text is so obscure that it's nearly impossible to provide a clear translation. The content is essentially an elaborate praise of Kings. Whether this piece originally had a proper title is uncertain because the current headings were clearly added by a later editor, as we have observed in several other instances. Therefore, I have taken the liberty to title it "The Encomium of Kings," and placed the content headings in parentheses. Reitzenstein, in his analysis of the collection, concludes that this Eulogy was added to the collection of treatises by the original editor or collector.He was an Egyptian Rhetorician who followed the Trismegistic tradition. His main goal in compiling the collection was to show the Rulers of the Empire that the Hermes religion posed no threat to them. In fact, its core teachings promoted loyalty to the Empire's leaders. Thanks to this "Apology," we are fortunate to have preserved our Corpus.

SPECULATIONS ON THE DATE

Identifying the "most noble Sirs" mentioned in sections 5 and 7, to whom the Eulogy is addressed, is difficult. Although the subject is a general "Encomium of Kings," the writer likely had a specific King in mind in section 16. These "most noble" individuals might have been high officials of Egypt. The conclusion of our Encomium is missing, so we lack clear indications of which Emperor was intended to read the Eulogy. As it stands, the clues are very vague. Reitzenstein believes that the references in section 16 fit best with the reign of Diocletian (285-305 A.D.). However, he notes that an earlier date is also possible. Only after examining the Encomium as an example of later Greek "art-prose" or rhythmic prose, particularly studied by Meyer and Wilamowitz, does Reitzenstein conclude that the style matches the time of Diocletian's Triumph in 302 A.D. Nevertheless, I am not convinced by his arguments.The lengthy and intricate introduction (sections 1-5) doesn't need further discussion; it's certainly "fine writing," but some parts are hard to translate accurately. 

THE STORY OF THE PYTHIC GRASSHOPPER

6. Starting from section 6, our interest is piqued because it reminds us of the famous introduction to the Protrepticus, or Exhortation to the Greeks, by Clement of Alexandria, where he says:

"I could tell you about another story and singer, Eunomus the Locrian and the Pythic grasshopper. At Pytho, there was a grand gathering of Greeks to celebrate the Death of the Serpent, with Eunomus singing the funeral song. 

Whether his song was a hymn or a dirge, I don't know; but there was a competition, and Eunomus had to play his harp in the heat of the day when the grasshoppers, warmed by the sun, were singing under the leaves on the hills. 

They were singing not to the Serpent, the dead thing, but to God the All-wise, in a freeform song much better than Eunomus' tunes. A string breaks for Eunomus; the grasshopper lands on the harp, chirping as if on a branch, and the minstrel, adjusting to the grasshopper's song, filled in the missing string. 

It wasn't that the grasshopper was drawn to Eunomus' song, as the story suggests, resulting in a bronze statue of Eunomus, his harp, and his helper at Pytho; the grasshopper flew on and sang naturally. The Greeks, however, thought it was making music."

This passage indicates that the story our author refers to was well known, so well known that Clement uses it to offer a natural explanation for a Hellenic miracle.There is no evidence that one text depends on the other, as the similarity between "ten neyran aneple'rusen aytui" in our text and "o uidos ten leipoysan aneple'ruse xorden" in Clement's work is too slight to support such an argument.

11. There is clearly a gap after section 10, and based on the opening words of section 11, it must be significant, as the Praise of Kings so far is very brief. It's also worth noting that the author's style becomes much easier when discussing the Praises of God; his words flow more naturally, likely because he is more familiar with this subject, as he should be if he studied the treatises he collected.

THE TRUE KING

13. The idea that all subjects are children of the King is Egyptian, or rather, it is a tradition of all nations that believed in Divine Kings. The true King embodies all his subjects; they are all parts, or as we might say, cells, of his true Body. The nation is the King, and the nation's victory is attributed to the King's virtue.

THE FELLOW-RULERS OF THE HEIGHT

14. Reitzenstein (p. 208) interprets the last three sentences of section 14 as referring to the Kings under the Emperor, bound by a common bond of love, to emphasize the Diocletian date. However, I would relate the idea to the ideal of harmony and unity of the Beings of the Intelligible World, as described by Plotinus, who wrote:

"They see themselves in others. For all things are transparent, and there is nothing dark or resisting, and everyone is manifest to everyone internally, and all things are made manifest; for light is manifest to light."Everyone possesses everything within themselves and can see everything in others. Therefore, everything is everywhere, everything is in everyone, and each person contains all things, showcasing infinite glory. Each person is significant, as even the small things are great. The sun contains all the stars, and each star is also the sun. In every person, one thing stands out, but it also reflects everything else.

[Page 303]

Compare this with the vision in The Untitled Apocalypse of the Codex Brucianus:

"Their crowns emit rays; the brilliance of their bodies is like the life of the space they inhabit. The word (Logos) from their mouths is eternal life, and the light from their eyes gives them rest. The movement of their hands signifies their return to the space they came from. Gazing at their faces brings self-knowledge. Giving to themselves is a repeated return, and stretching out their hands establishes them. Hearing with their ears is understanding in their hearts. The union of their limbs represents the gathering of Israel. Holding onto each other strengthens them in the Logos."

This reflects the Egyptian counterpart of Plotinian Ecstasis, noting that Plotinus was Egyptian by birth.### The Perfect Sermon

**The Asclepius**

*Note: The original Greek text is lost, and only a Latin version remains. I use the text of Hildebrand (G. F.), L. Apuleii Opera Omnia ex Fide Optimorum Codicum (Leipzig, 1842), Part II., pp. 279-334; but have occasionally preferred the text in Patrizzi's Nova de Universis Philosophia (Venice, 1593), or the Bipontine edition of Appuleius, Lucii Apuleji Madaurensis Platonici Philosophi Opera (Biponti, 1788), pp. 285-325.*

---

**1. [*1] [I. M. [*2]] [Trismegistus.]**

God has brought you to us, Asclepius, so you can hear a divine sermon. This sermon is more divine than any we have previously spoken or been inspired to speak by the Divine. 

If you view this Word with the eye of intellect, your mind will be completely filled with all good things. This is true if you believe that the "many" are good, and not the "one," in which all things are contained. The difference between the two lies in their unity—"All" is part of "One," and "One" contains "All." They are so closely connected that they cannot be separated. You will understand this better from the sermon that follows. But for now, Asclepius, please step out and call in the person who is to hear this as well.

(When the person had come in, Asclepius suggested that Ammon should also be allowed to join. Then Trismegistus said:)

There is no reason to exclude Ammon. We have written many things addressed to him, treating him like a dear and beloved son, covering many topics in physics and ethics. However, I will dedicate this treatise to you, Asclepius.But please, only call Ammon and no one else, so that a sermon on such a great topic isn't ruined by the presence of a crowd. It's a sign of an irreverent mind to share a discussion full of the Greatness of Divinity with the masses. (When Ammon had also come into the sacred place, and the holy group of four was complete with piety and God's presence, they sat in reverent silence, their souls and minds attentive to Hermes' words, as Divine Love began to speak.)

1. [Tris.] The soul of every person, Asclepius, is immortal; but not all in the same way or at the same time. Asc. Then, Thrice-greatest one, aren't all souls of the same quality? Tris. How quickly you've strayed from reason, Asclepius! Didn't I say that "All" is "One," and "One" is "All," because everything existed within the Creator before it was created. He is rightly called "All," as His parts are the "All." So, throughout this discussion, remember Him who is "One"-"All," or the maker of the "All."

2. All things descend from Heaven to Earth, to Water, and to Air. Only Fire, which rises, gives life; what descends serves Fire. Additionally, what comes from above creates; what flows upwards nourishes. Earth alone, resting on itself, receives everything and restores all kinds it receives. This Whole, as you remember, includes everything. In other words, all things, under "Soul" and "World," are in constant flux, varied by the diverse equality of all their forms. Countless distinct qualities can be observed, yet they are united by the bond that makes all seem as One, and from "One" comes "All."### III

1. The entire Universe is composed of four elements: Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. The Universe is one, its Soul is one, and God is one. Now, give me all your attention and focus. The understanding of Divinity can only be grasped with a concentrated and similar intent.

It is like a rushing torrent, crashing down from above with overwhelming force, so swift that it surpasses our ability to fully comprehend, not just for listeners but even for teachers.Compare this with the description of the instruction of the Therapeuts in Philo's famous treatise, "On the Contemplative Life," as found in Conybeare's text (Oxford; 1895): "When giving an interpretation and speaking rapidly without pausing for breath, the minds of the listeners fall behind, unable to keep up." 

In "Thrice-Greatest Hermes, Vol. 2" by G.R.S. Mead (1906), it is written:

Heaven, which is the sensible God, directs all bodies. The growth and decline of bodies are controlled by the Sun and Moon. The one who rules the Heaven, its Soul, and everything within the Cosmos is God, the creator of all things. From everything mentioned above, over which the same God rules, flows a stream of all things throughout the Cosmos and the Soul, encompassing all classes and kinds within Nature. The Cosmos has been designed by God to hold forms of every kind.

By these kinds of things, forward-thinking Nature has extended the Cosmos to Heaven using the Four Elements, all for the pleasure of God's eye.

Everything dependent from Above is divided into species in the manner I will explain. The genera of all things associate with their species, meaning the genus is a complete class, and the species is part of a genus. Thus, the genus of the Gods will produce the species of the Gods from itself. Similarly, the genus of daimons, men, birds, and all animals within the Cosmos brings forth species like itself.There is another category besides animals—a category that, like a soul, can feel sensations. This means that it can be happy in good conditions and suffer in bad ones. I'm referring to all the plants on Earth, which depend on healthy roots and shoots for their life. These plants are found all over the Earth. 

The Heaven itself is full of God. The categories we just mentioned extend to all immortal species. For example, a species is part of a category, like humans are part of humanity, and each part must follow the characteristics of its category. Therefore, even though all categories are eternal, not all species are. The category of Divinity is eternal in both itself and its species.

The categories of other things are also everlasting. Even though they may die in their specific forms, they continue to exist by reproducing. This is why individual species are subject to death, but the category as a whole is immortal. For example, individual humans die, but humanity continues to live.

The species of all categories are mixed with all other categories; some were created earlier, and some are created from these. The newly created ones, whether by Gods, spirits, or humans, closely resemble their own categories. It is impossible for bodies to be formed without God's will, for species to take shape without the help of spirits, or for animals to be taught and trained without humans.

Any spirits that exceed their own category and unite with a species due to their proximity to any species of the Godlike class are considered similar to Gods.Modern English Version:

Certain types of spirits, who maintain their nature, love human rationality and are referred to as true daimons. This is also true for humans, perhaps even more so. Humanity is diverse and complex, forming a variety of combinations with other species and almost everything else due to the associations mentioned earlier.

Therefore, if a person connects with the Gods through godly piety and their mind, they draw closer to the Gods and also to the daimons. On the other hand, people who are satisfied with the mediocrity of their own kind, and other types of humans, will resemble the species with which they have aligned themselves.

VI

1. For these reasons, Asclepius, man is a remarkable being—worthy of our admiration and respect.For he transforms into God's Nature, as if he were God himself. This kind of person also understands the nature of spirits, recognizing a shared origin with them. He thinks little of his human side, confident in the divine part of himself. Human nature is the happiest blend of all because, connected to the Gods through his divine aspect, a man looks down on the part of him that is earthly. He binds the rest of the world to himself with love due to the divine order within him, and thus he is drawn to Heaven.

So, man has his place in a blessed middle position; he loves those below him and is loved by those above. He works the Earth. He interacts with the Elements due to his quick mind. He explores the Sea's depths with its profoundness. He values all things. Heaven doesn't seem too high for him; his wisdom makes it feel close. No darkness of the Air blocks his mind's insight. No density of Earth hinders his work. No depth of Water dulls his vision.

Though he remains the same, he is part of everything and is everywhere the same. Of all these kinds of beings, those that are animals have many roots stretching from above to below, while stationary beings have one root that branches upward. Some are nourished by two types of food, others by one. The two types of food are for the soul and the body, which all animals are made of. Their soul is nourished by the constant motion of the World, and their bodies grow from food drawn from the water and the earth of the lower world.Spirit, which fills everyone and blends with everything else, gives life to all. In humans, sense and reason are added, with reason being unique to humans as a gift from the aether. Of all living beings, God enhances, extends, and elevates the sense of humans alone to understand Divine Reason.

Since I am prompted to talk about Sense, I will explain it further later, as it is sacred and powerful, almost as much as Divine Reason itself.

Now, I will finish what I started. I was talking about union with the Gods, through which only humans consciously enjoy the Gods' presence. This happens when they achieve a state of divine intelligence, the highest form of sense found in both God and human reason.

Are not the senses of all humans the same? No, Asclepius, not everyone has achieved true reason. Many pursue a false version of reason and never see the real thing, leading them astray. This causes evil in their minds, transforming them from the best of animals into beasts.

Regarding Sense and similar topics, I will fully explain them when I discuss Spirit. Humans are unique because they are twofold. One part is simple, what the Greeks call the "essential man," and we refer to as the "form of the Divine Similitude."He is also fourfold: what the Greeks call "hylic," or what we call "cosmic," which makes up the physical part. This physical part houses the divine element in humans—the divine Mind and its pure senses, which find home and rest within the body, as if enclosed by its walls.What, then, has caused it that humans should live in the world and not in the highest happiness where God resides? 

You ask rightly, Asclepius! We pray to God to give us the ability to explain this reason, since everything depends on His will, especially matters concerning the highest reality, which is the focus of our discussion. Listen, Asclepius!

1. The Lord and Creator of all things, whom we rightly call God, made a second entity from Himself, the Visible and Sensible God. I call Him Sensible not because He has sensations Himself, but because He is perceived by those who see. When He made this second God, who appeared very beautiful and filled with goodness, He loved Him as part of His own divinity.

2. Because this second God was so mighty and beautiful, God wanted someone else to be able to appreciate Him. So, He created humans, who could imitate His Reason and Love. God's will is complete in itself; as soon as He wills something, it is accomplished. When He realized that humans, in their essential form, could not love all things without a physical body, He placed them in a body. He decreed that all humans should have both a spiritual and a physical nature, blending them into a harmonious whole.God created humans with both a soul and a body, combining eternal and mortal elements. This allows humans to honor their dual nature by admiring and worshipping heavenly things while managing and governing earthly matters.

By "mortal things," I do not mean water or earth themselves, as these are eternal elements controlled by humans. Instead, I refer to things created by humans or derived from them, such as farming, pastures, buildings, harbors, travel, communication, and mutual services. These activities form strong connections among people and with the physical world, which includes land and water. This part of the world is sustained through knowledge and the use of arts and sciences, without which God does not intend for the universe to be complete.

God's will ensures that what He desires will happen. It is unlikely that what pleases Him once will ever displease Him, as He has always known what will occur and what will delight Him.### Modern English Version:

### IX

1. [V. M.] But, O Asclepius, I see that you are eager to know how man can love and worship Heaven and the things within it. Listen then, Asclepius! The love of God and Heaven, along with everything in it, is a continuous act of worship.

No other beings, whether gods or animals, can do this except for man alone. It is through human admiration, adoration, praise, and acts of worship that Heaven and its inhabitants find joy.

2. The Muses' choir has been sent by the Highest Deity to mankind to ensure that the world does not seem too uncultured without the charm of music. Through songs and praise, accompanied by music, we can worship Him who is everything or the Father of everything. This way, even on Earth, there is the sweetness of heavenly harmony.

3. A few people, endowed with Pure Mind, have been given the sacred duty of contemplating Heaven.People who have not yet separated their inner reason from their physical body are meant to study the elements and everything below them. Humans are animals, but being partly mortal doesn't make them less powerful. In fact, it makes them more capable of reaching true understanding because they possess both mortality and reason. They are uniquely formed to handle both earthly matters and heavenly love.

I want you, Asclepius, to understand the reasoning behind this idea with both the keen attention and the living power of your soul. This reasoning is something most people cannot believe; only the holiest minds can grasp the Perfect and the True. Let's begin.

Footnotes

1. One form of constant service. Cf. Ex. i. 3.
2. Cf. C. H., xvi. 11: "The duty of mankind is to give worship."
3. Perhaps "Muse-inspired"; a word unique to this text.
4. Cf. vii. 1 and 2 above.
5. Note an error in the text that the editor has not corrected.

The first God is the Lord of Eternity, the second is the Cosmos, and the third is man.God is the Creator of the Universe and everything within it. He also governs all things, including humans, who are the overseers of the physical world. Humans embrace this responsibility out of love, so that both humanity and the Universe can enhance each other. Due to this divine connection, the term "Cosmos" is fittingly used to describe the Universe.

Humans understand both themselves and the Universe. They remember what is beneficial for their parts and use these memories to serve themselves, giving praise and thanks to God. They respect God’s image, recognizing that they too are a reflection of God. In fact, there are two images of God: the Cosmos and humanity.

Humans are unique because they possess a soul, senses, spirit, and reason, making them divine. This divinity allows them to aspire to higher realms, such as Heaven. However, their physical part, made of fire, water, and air, keeps them mortal and grounded on Earth. This dual nature ensures that they don’t abandon their earthly responsibilities. Thus, humans are both immortal in one aspect and mortal in another.

The primary attribute of this dual nature in humans is piety, followed by goodness. This attribute is perfected when fortified with the virtue of disregarding material desires. Earthly possessions, driven by bodily desires, are alien to the divine essence of humans and the Gods. These possessions are not inherent to us but are acquired later, which is why they are called possessions.All such things, then, are foreign to man—even his body. Therefore, we can disdain not only what we desire but also the source of this desire. As our reason grows, so should our humanity, allowing us to focus on the divine and disregard the mortal part attached to us for functioning in the lower world.

Man is made complete by elements of both the divine and the earthly, having pairs of hands and feet, and other body parts that serve the physical world. Additionally, man has senses, soul, memory, and foresight, enabling him to understand divine matters and make judgments. However, weighed down by the body's imperfections, man struggles to fully comprehend the true nature of all things.

Man, created and set for such service by the Highest God, maintains the world order and worships God appropriately. Given such duties, what reward do you think he should receive?If the Cosmos is indeed God's work, then anyone who preserves and enhances its beauty through love is aligning their actions with God's Will. By putting effort and care into shaping the world using their own abilities, what reward should they expect if not the same blessing our ancestors received? We pray that God, when you have completed your time on Earth and freed yourself from worldly constraints, restores you to your pure and holy divine nature.

1. Student: You speak rightly and truthfully, Thrice-great one. This is the reward for those who live piously and dedicate their lives to helping the world. However, those who live impiously are denied a return to Heaven and are destined to migrate into other, unworthy bodies. As our discussion shows, souls on Earth risk losing the hope of future immortality.

2. Some may find this beyond belief, a mere tale, or even a subject for mockery. In this life, the pleasure derived from possessions is enjoyable. This envy of immortality imprisons the soul, keeping it focused on its mortal part and preventing it from knowing its divine aspect.

3. I prophesy that no one after us will have the pure love of wisdom that consists of knowing Divinity alone, through perpetual contemplation and holy piety.Many people confuse philosophy with complex reasoning.

Why do so many people find philosophy hard to grasp? Why do they mix it up with complicated reasoning?

Trismegistus: It's because they combine it with difficult subjects like arithmetic, music, and geometry. But true philosophy, which relies solely on godly devotion, should only engage with these other fields to the extent that it can appreciate the mathematical patterns of the stars and their movements. It should also understand the Earth's dimensions, the depths of the oceans, the power of fire, and the nature of all these elements. In doing so, it should give praise to the wisdom and creativity of God. True music, in this sense, is simply understanding the order of all things as decreed by God's Reason. When everything is harmonized, it creates the sweetest and truest harmony with God's own Song.

Asclepius: Who will come after us?

Trismegistus: They will be misled by clever but deceptive arguments and will stray from True Philosophy, which is pure and holy love. True Philosophy is to worship God with a single mind and soul, to respect His creations, and to give thanks to His Will, which is the ultimate Good. This is Philosophy without the soul's rough curiosity. Let's leave it at that for now.The original Greek word "kosmos" is kept in the Latin text; it means "order, adornment, ornament," as well as "world." The idea is that man is a microcosm. He is considered "cosmic" because his body is made of the elements, making him a small version of the universe, the macrocosm. 

This phrase, "ab omnibus divinae cognationis partibus," seems somewhat repetitive. The first part translates to "whatever is possessed by earthly bodily desire; these are rightly called possessions." This word play in Latin might suggest an embellishment by the translator; it could have been in the original text. 

The text appears quite unclear; the Latin translation might be at fault unless "other members" are considered to be grouped in sets of double pairs. 

"Singular" refers to species in the Cosmos, according to the type in the Divine Mind. 

The Latin here does not make sense. 

Notice the use of "dixero," which we might call the "prophetic" tense. This use reminds us of the "Sibylline" literature and the prophetic writings of the time. 

"Heavenly Love," as mentioned in Philo's "De Vita Contemplativa," describes the Therapeuts who were "afire with God."Let's simplify and modernize the text without altering its original meaning:

---

2. Now let's discuss Spirit and related matters. In the beginning, there was God and Matter, which we Greeks believe to be the Cosmos. Spirit was present with the Cosmos, or within it, but not in the same way as in God. There were not yet the things from which the Cosmos would be born. They were not, simply because they had not yet come into being; they were still in the state from which they would eventually be born.

Only things that have not yet been born are called ungenerated, but also those that lack the power to generate, so nothing can be born from them. Therefore, whatever has the power to generate is capable of being born, meaning that birth can occur from them, even if they are born from themselves alone. Clearly, birth can easily occur from those born from themselves, as everything is born from them.

3. God, the everlasting and eternal, was never born and cannot be born. God is, was, and will always be. This is God's nature—everything comes from itself alone. But Matter (or the Nature of the Cosmos) and Spirit, although they don't seem to be born from any source, possess the power of generation and fertility within themselves. The beginning lies in the nature that has the power and matter for conception and birth. This nature, without needing another, can generate itself.

---

This version translates the original text into clearer and more accessible modern English while preserving its core meaning.On the other hand, while some things can only come into being by blending with another nature, this Space of the Cosmos, along with everything in it, seems not to have been born because it contains all of Nature's potential.

By "Space," I mean the place where everything exists. None of these things could exist without Space to contain them. For anything to exist, there must be Space to accommodate it. Without Space, qualities, quantities, positions, and operations of things could not be distinguished because they would be nowhere.

So, the Cosmos, even though it was not born, contains the birth of everything within it, providing fertile ground for their conception. Therefore, it represents the totality of Matter's creative potential, even though it itself was not created. Since Matter's nature is inherently productive, it produces both good and bad outcomes.

I have not, therefore, O Asclepius and Ammon, agreed with those who say that God could not remove and banish evil from existence. No response is needed for them. Yet, for your sake, I will continue and give a reason. They argue that God should have removed all evil from the World because it seems to be an integral part of it. This was foreseen by the Highest God, who made provision as much as could reasonably be made when He endowed human minds with sense, science, and intelligence.We surpass other animals solely because of these qualities, which allow us to avoid traps and wrongdoing.

Anyone who turns away from such dangers upon recognizing them, before becoming entangled, is guided by divine intelligence and prudence. The foundation of true knowledge is built upon the virtues. The Spirit governs and enlivens everything in the Cosmos, subject to the Will of the Highest God, like a machine under control. We should understand Him as the Highest God, who can only be comprehended by the mind, the Ruler and Director of the visible universe. He encompasses all Space, Substance, and Matter, and everything that exists.

1. The Spirit governs all species in the Cosmos, each according to its nature given by God. Matter, or Cosmos, holds everything together, serving as the realm of motion. God rules over it, providing each cosmic entity with what it needs. He fills everything with Spirit, according to their nature.

2. The spherical form of the Cosmos makes it impossible for it to see itself entirely. No matter how high a vantage point you choose, you cannot see the bottom because various parts obstruct the view, giving the illusion of visibility throughout.

The Cosmos appears to be visible everywhere due to the forms and images it contains, but in reality, it is always invisible to itself.The lowest part of a sphere is called "a-eides" in Greek because "eidein" in Greek means "seeing," and the sphere's beginning cannot be seen. Hence, the species are named "eideai," since they are forms we cannot see. Because they lack visibility, they are called "Hades" in Greek, and since they are at the bottom of the sphere, they are called "Inferi" in Latin. These are the primary sources of all things within them, through them, or from them.

1. Asc. So, all things in themselves are cosmic principles of all the species within them, or the essence of each one of them.

Tris. The Cosmos nourishes bodies; the Spirit nourishes souls; and the Higher Sense, a gift to mankind, feeds the mind. Only a few people have minds capable of receiving this great blessing.

2. Just as the Sun illuminates the world, the mind of man is illuminated by this Light, even more so. The Sun's light can be blocked by the Earth, Moon, or night. However, once the Higher Sense merges with the human soul, they unite, and such minds are no longer trapped in darkness. Thus, it is said that the Higher Senses are the souls of Gods, but I add: not all Gods, just the great ones, or even the principles of these great ones.The Latin translation is unclear. The original text likely stated that Spirit and Cosmos (or Matter) were initially unified as Spirit-Matter.

That is, they existed in potential form.

The Latin term used is "Hoc."

Again, the Latin text uses "yle."

Compare with "Matter or Cosmos" in section xvii. 2.

The term "Principio" means "beginning," the same word used in the Vulgate translation of the Prologue of the fourth Gospel.

The term "Initium" is used.

This suggests that the concept of "Cosmos" is understood as the duality of Spirit-Matter.

Refers to Primal Nature, or Spirit-Matter.

Compare with sections xxx. 1 and xxxiv. 1 below.

The Latin construction is very faulty.

The term "Naturas" is used.

Literally means nature.

Refers to evil or bad.

Presumably in the higher sense.

Refers to Cosmos.

Again, the term "yle" is used.

The term "Agitatio" is used.

The term "Frequentatio" is used.

"Cava rotunditas" presumably means concavity.

The Latin translation is evidently faulty. Menard often omits difficult sentences.

The term "A-eide's" means "Invisible," referring to Hades (Aides or Ades).

The term "eidein" is likely "idein."

"Primum spherae" refers to the top, bottom, or periphery of the world-sphere.

The term "eideai" likely means "ideai," referring to forms or species, including the highest species viewed as "ideas."

Refers to the center.

Or principles and priorities (antiquiora).

Refers to the "ideas."

The Latin text is hopeless.

Compare with section vii. 1.

Thrice-Greatest Hermes, Vol. 2, by G.R.S. Mead, [1906], at sacred-texts.com

XIX

1. [VIII. M.] Asc. Thrice-Greatest, what do you call the origins or sources of things? Tris. The mysteries I reveal to you are profound, the secrets divine. Therefore, I begin this explanation with prayers for Heaven's favor.The hierarchies of gods are numerous, and they are divided into two classes: the Noumenal and the Sensible.

The Noumenal gods are not called such because they are beyond our senses. In fact, we perceive these gods more truly than the visible ones, as our argument will demonstrate. If you pay attention, you will understand. Deep reasoning, especially if it is too divine for the average person to grasp, will be lost if the listener does not pay close attention. It will return to its source, mingling with its original stream.

There are some gods who are the principals of all species.

Next, there are those whose essence is their principal. These are the Sensible gods, each similar to its dual source, who affect all things through their sensibility. They make the appropriate work of each thing shine through one part affecting the other part.

For Heaven, or whatever it encompasses, the essence-chief is Zeus, as Zeus gives life to all through Heaven. The essence-chief of the Sun is light, as the good gift of light is provided to us through the Sun's disk.

The "Thirty-six" gods, known as Horoscopes, are in the same space as the Fixed Stars. Their essence-chief is called Pantomorph or Omniform, who shapes various forms for different species. The "Seven" spheres have essence-chiefs or rulers, collectively known as Fortune and Heimarmene, through whom everything changes according to nature's law, maintaining stability through constant motion.The Air, moreover, is the mechanism through which all things are made. There is, however, a primary essence above this, a second Air, that is mortal and interacts with mortal things.

4. These hierarchies of Gods are interconnected from bottom to top and relate to each other, moving towards unity. Mortal things are connected to mortal things, and sensible things to sensible things. The entire system of Rulership, however, appears to the Highest Lord as either few things or, more accurately, one thing. For everything depends on One and flows from it. When seen separately, they appear as many things, but in their union, they are one, or rather two, from which all things are made: Matter, through which other things are created, and the Will of Him, by whose command they come into being.

Asc. Is this the reason, O Thrice-greatest one?

Tris. It is, Asclepius. For God is the Father or the Lord of all, or whatever other name men use to refer to Him more reverently and piously. We should set these names apart for our understanding. If we contemplate this transcendent God, we should not limit Him with any of these names. A spoken word is a sound from the air, struck by breath, expressing the whole will of a person or the higher sense perceived by the mind when beyond all senses. A name, made of a syllable or two, serves as a necessary link between voice and ear. Thus, the Name of God must encompass Sense, Spirit, Air, and all things within, through, or with them.I don't believe the Creator of everything, the Father and Lord of all, could ever have just one name, even if made up of many parts. He is beyond naming, or rather, can be called by every name. He is both One and All, so all things must share His name, or He must be called by the names of all things.

He alone, complete in the fertility of both sexes, always gives birth to whatever He wills. His Will is pure goodness, which is the goodness of all things, stemming from His divine nature. This ensures that all things exist as they have and will continue to exist, born from themselves and sufficient in their own being.

This, Asclepius, is why and how all things are made of both sexes.

Asclepius: So, you speak of God, Thrice-greatest one?

Thrice-greatest: Not just God, Asclepius, but all living and non-living things. Nothing can be unfruitful. If fertility were removed, nothing could remain as it is. Nature, Sense, and the Cosmos have the power to be born and to preserve all things born. Each sex is full of the power to create, and there is a unity, an incomprehensible union, which you can call Eros or Aphrodite, or both.This, then, is truer than all truth and clearer than what the mind perceives: from the Universal God of Universal Nature, all things have received the mystery of creation, which includes the sweetest Charity, Joy, Merriment, Longing, and Divine Love. We might have had to explain the power and influence of this mystery, if it were not already known to everyone through personal experience and self-observation.

For if you consider that supreme moment when one nature gives birth to another, and when the other eagerly absorbs it and hides it deeper within itself, then, at that time, from their union, females take on the nature of males, and males grow weary with female listlessness. The consummation of this mystery, so sweet and necessary, happens in secret to prevent the deity of either sex from being embarrassed by natural intercourse, especially in front of ignorant people.

1. The pious are not numerous; they are very few and can be counted in the world. This results in many inheriting bad traits due to a lack of knowledge and understanding of reality. It is from the intelligence of Divine Reason, which orders all things, that contempt for and remedy of vice are born throughout the world. But when ignorance persists, all vices grow strong and plague the soul with incurable wounds, causing it to swell as if poisoned—except for those who understand the Discipline of souls and the highest Cure of intellect.So, even though this may benefit only a few, it is important to develop and explain this idea: why has Divinity chosen to share His knowledge and intelligence with humans alone? Listen carefully!

When God, our Father and Lord, created humans, He made them with a mix of a less pure cosmic part and a divine part. Naturally, the imperfections of the cosmic part remained within us, along with other imperfections, because we share food and sustenance with all living beings. As a result, desires, passions, and other vices of the mind tend to occupy human souls.

As for the Gods, since they were made from the purest part of Nature and do not need reason and discipline to support them—though their immortality and eternal youth provide them with wisdom and knowledge—God, by His everlasting law, decreed an order for them, bound by necessity. In contrast, God distinguishes humans from other animals by reason and discipline alone, through which humans can overcome their bodily vices, with His help, aiming for immortality.

In conclusion, God made humans both good and capable of sharing in immortal life, combining mortal and divine natures. Because humans are created this way by God's Will, they are meant to be superior to both the immortal Gods and all mortal beings.Because of this connection, humans honor the Gods with reverence and a holy mind, and in return, the Gods protect and watch over humans with compassionate care.

1. However, this applies only to a few people with pious minds. As for the wicked, we should not mention them, so as not to ruin a sacred sermon by thinking of them.And since our discussion is about the relationship and interaction between humans and gods, learn, Asclepius, the power and strength of humans! Our Lord and Father, or the Highest God, is the creator of the gods in Heaven, and similarly, humans are the creators of gods in temples. These gods in temples not only receive light from humans but also emit light to all. Humans don't just move towards the gods; they also establish the gods on earth.

Are you surprised, Asclepius? Do you not believe it? 

Asclepius: I am amazed, Thrice-Greatest One, but I willingly agree with all your words. I consider the man who has achieved such great happiness to be truly blessed.

Thrice-Greatest: And rightly so; he deserves our admiration because he is the greatest of them all.The nature of the gods in Heaven is evident from their composition, which comes from the finest parts of nature. The most distinguishing feature of these gods is primarily their heads.

On the other hand, the gods created by humans are made from elements of nature—both the ancient, more divine nature, and the nature within humans. These gods are not just designed with attention to their heads but also every part of their body. Therefore, when humans create images of divinity, they remember their own nature and origins. Just as our Creator made the gods to be eternal and similar to Himself, humans make their gods in their own image.

Asclepius: You are not talking about statues, are you, Thrice-greatest one?
Trismegistus: Yes, I am talking about statues, Asclepius. Do you not see how you even question it? Statues filled with life, senses, and spirit, which perform incredible and unusual feats. These statues can foresee the future and perhaps even prophesy, revealing things through dreams and other means. They can either drain a person’s strength or heal their sorrow if deserved. Do you not know, Asclepius, that Egypt is an image of Heaven, or more accurately, a reflection or descent of everything governed and exercised in Heaven? More truly, our land is the Shrine of the whole World.

Additionally, it is important for the wise to know everything beforehand, so you should not be ignorant of this.The time will come when Egypt's devoted worship of the divine will seem futile, and all its holy practices will come to nothing. The divine will soon depart from Earth to Heaven, leaving Egypt behind. The land, once filled with sacred rites, will be abandoned by the gods. Foreigners will overrun the region, and not only will there be neglect of sacred rituals, but even worse, laws will be enacted to punish those who practice them, effectively banning them completely.

This once holy land, home to our shrines and temples, will be filled with tombs and corpses.

Oh Egypt, only stories of your sacred practices will remain, unbelievable even to your own people; only words carved on your stones will tell of your pious deeds.

Egypt will become home to foreigners, like Scythians or Indians.

The divine beings will return to Heaven, leaving their worshippers to die out; Egypt will be abandoned by both gods and men.

And now I speak to you, O holy River! I tell you what will happen. Your waters will overflow with blood. Not only will your divine streams be stained, but they will all flow with it. The number of tombs will far exceed the living, and the few survivors will be Egyptians in name only, acting like foreigners.

Why do you weep, Asclepius? Even worse, Egypt herself will be driven to even greater miseries.For she, the Holy Land, once most beloved by God for her pious service on earth, will become the epitome of barbarism. Out of our disdain for humanity, the world will no longer seem deserving of our awe and admiration. All the good, the fairest sight that has ever existed or will ever exist, will be at risk. 

It will become a burden to people, leading them to despise and no longer love the cosmos as a whole—the unchanging work of God, the glorious creation of the Good, filled with a variety of forms, the engine of God's Will, ungrudgingly supporting His work, the multitude unified and worthy of reverence, praise, and love by those with the eyes to see.

Darkness will be preferred over Light, and Death will seem better than Life. No one will look up to Heaven; the pious will be seen as mad, the impious as wise; the frenzied as strong, the worst as the best. 

The soul, and everything regarding it—whether it believes in its immortality or its potential to achieve it, as I have explained—will be considered not just a joke, but pure vanity. Believe me, there will be a death penalty for those who devote themselves to the Religion of the Mind. New laws will come into effect, a new order; nothing sacred, nothing pious, nothing worthy of Heaven or the Gods will be heard or even believed in.The sorrowful departure of the Gods from humanity occurs; only bad angels remain, who will mix with humans and lead them into all sorts of reckless behavior, such as wars, robberies, and deceit—everything that goes against the soul's nature.

Then, the Earth will no longer hold together; the Sea will be unsailable; the Stars will no longer follow their courses in the sky. The voice of every God will fall silent, unable to break the Great Silence. The fruits of the Earth will rot, the Earth will stop producing, and the Air itself will weaken in sadness.

When this happens, it will mark the World's old age, filled with impiety, disorder, and a lack of rationality in all good things. And when these things come to pass, Asclepius, our Lord and Father, the First and Ruler of the One God, will curb crime and call back error from corruption to good manners and spontaneous deeds aligned with His Will (God's Goodness). He will end all evil, either by washing it away with a flood, burning it away with fire, or through widespread diseases.

God will restore the Cosmos to its original form so that the World will again be worthy of worship and admiration. Humanity will then continuously praise and bless God, the Creator and Restorer of such a vast work.

This rebirth of the Cosmos will renew all good things and bring Nature itself back to its holy and pious state through a set course of time—Nature, which has no beginning and no end, just like God's Will, which is eternal.Because God's nature determines the will. Determination is the highest good, isn't it, Thrice-greatest one?

Trismegistus: Asclepius, will is born from determination; in fact, willing itself comes from the will. God does not desire anything because He is the fullness of all things and already possesses what He wills. He wills all good things and possesses all that He wills. Rather, He thinks and wills all good. This is God; the world of good is His image.

Asclepius: Is the Cosmos good, Thrice-greatest one?

Trismegistus: It is good, as I will explain to you, Asclepius. Just as God is the provider and steward of good things to all species in the Cosmos—such as sense, soul, and life—so the Cosmos gives and bestows all things that seem good to us mortals, like the changing seasons, the growth of fruits, birth, maturity, and similar things. This is why God transcends the highest heaven, extending everywhere, and sees all things from every side.

Beyond the heaven, there is starless space, empty of any physical body. The ruler between heaven and earth, whom we call Zeus Above, oversees this space. The Earth and Sea are ruled by Zeus Below, who nourishes mortal lives and fruit-bearing trees. The powers of all these gods cause fruits, trees, and the earth to grow green. The powers and energies of all the other gods are distributed throughout all things.

Those who rule the earth will be distributed through all lands and eventually gathered in a state at the top of Egypt's upper part, which will be founded towards the setting sun and to which all the mortal race will flock.

Asclepius: But now, at this moment, where are they, Thrice-greatest one?

Trismegistus:They are gathered in a very large community on the Libyan Hill. Enough has already been said about this.

17. See chapter 12, section 2 above.Evil angels—usually referred to as demons in our writings. However, as Lactantius notes in "Divine Institutes" (ii. 15), Hermes calls demons "evil angels" (aggeloys ponerous), suggesting he likely borrowed this from the Greek original of our sermon.

Refer to "Corpus Hermeticum," x. (xi.) 21.

The phrase "omnis vox divina" could also be interpreted as "the whole Word of God."

This passage, cited in the original Greek by Lactantius in "Divine Institutes" (vii. 8), is from the "Perfect Sermon" of Hermes. It reads:

"When these events come to pass, Asclepius, our Lord and Father, the God and Creator of the First and One God, will observe what happens. He will enforce His Will, which is Good, against disorder, correcting error and purging the bad, either by washing it away with floodwaters, burning it with fire, or forcibly expelling it through war and famine. He will restore His Cosmos to its original state, thus achieving its Restoration."

Refer to "Corpus Hermeticum," iii. (iv.) 1.

"Consilium" translates to "counsel."

This statement seems to contradict "Corpus Hermeticum," x. (xi.) 10, but it is not necessarily so.

It likely means a higher sense, possibly interpreted as "sensus" instead of "sensibus."

Jupiter Plutonius could be interpreted as "Zeus of the Underworld" (Sarapis?); the original term was likely Zeus Aidoneus.

It is unclear who "these" refers to; it might include all previously mentioned, but this is unsatisfactory. The Latin translation is likely flawed.

Or it could mean "city."

"In summo Aegypti initio" translates to "at the beginning of Egypt."

"Civitate" means "city."

"In monte Libyco" translates to "on a (or the) Libyan or African hill or mount." Compare with section xxxvii below.

Thrice-Greatest Hermes, Vol. 2, by G.R.S. Mead, [1906], at sacred-texts.com

Now, the question of immortality or mortality must be discussed.The expectation and fear of death torment many people who do not understand True Reason. Death happens when the body, exhausted from effort, breaks down, and its parts, which function together to sustain life, can no longer do so. The body dies when it can no longer support a person's life forces. This is death: the dissolution of the body and the end of physical sensation.

There is no need to worry about this type of death. However, there is another kind of death that no one can escape, although people often ignore or disbelieve it. 

Asclepius: What is this death that people are unaware of or refuse to believe in?

Trismegistus: Listen carefully, Asclepius.

When the soul leaves the body, its judgment and evaluation fall under the power of its highest daimon. If the soul is found to be pious and just, it is allowed to rest in appropriate places. But if it is stained with evil deeds and vice, it is cast down into the depths and subjected to turbulent forces of Air, Fire, and Water.

Between Heaven and Earth, the soul is dragged in different directions, suffering constant pain. Its immortal nature causes it to endure endless suffering because of its continuous awareness. We must fear and guard against getting caught in these toils. Those who do not believe now will be forced to believe through their own suffering, not just through words or threats.

Asclepius: Are human faults not punished by human laws alone?

Trismegistus: First of all, Asclepius, everything on Earth must die.Furthermore, those beings that live because of their bodies and cease to live for the same reason will receive rewards or punishments based on their actions in life. These punishments are harsher if their misdeeds were hidden until after their death. This is because, at that point, they become fully aware of everything due to divine judgment, and they receive punishments fitting their crimes.

Section XXIX

1. Asc. Do these people deserve even greater punishments, Thrice-greatest one? Tris. Certainly; for those condemned by human laws lose their lives violently so that everyone can see they did not die naturally but received the penalty they deserved. On the other hand, the righteous find protection in serving God and practicing deep piety. God shields such people from every harm.

2. Indeed, the Father of all, our Lord, who is everything, loves to reveal Himself to everyone. It is not by location, quality, or greatness but by the mind's understanding that He illuminates humanity. This happens to those who clear their souls of Error and see the brilliance of Truth, merging with the Divine Intelligence. Through this love, they gain freedom from the part of them that Death rules over and receive the promise of future immortality.

3. This is how the good will differ from the bad. Each good person will shine in piety, sanctity, wisdom, worship, and service to God, and see True Reason as clearly as if with physical eyes. Each will surpass others in confidence of belief, just as the Sun outshines the other stars with its light.The Sun illuminates the other stars not just because of its brightness, but because of its holiness and divinity.

Yes, my Asclepius, you should see the Sun as the second God, ruling everything and giving light to all living things in the universe, whether they have souls or not. Since the universe is a living entity and has always been and will always be alive, nothing within it can truly die. Every part of this ever-living universe is as everlasting as the whole. In this eternal entity, there is no room for death.

Therefore, the Sun embodies eternal life and immortality, as it must live forever. Just like the universe, the Sun endures forever. It is the ruler of all life forces, or vitality, and distributes them. God is the eternal ruler of all living things and life functions in the world, the everlasting source of Life itself.

God has once and for all given Life to all life forces and preserves them with an eternal law, as I will explain.

The universe moves within the very Life of Eternity, and Cosmic Space exists within the Everlastingness of Life itself. Thus, the universe will never stop or be destroyed, as it is protected and bound together by the eternity of Life.

The cosmos gives life to all within it and governs everything under the Sun. The movement of the cosmos involves a dual energy.Time is energized by Eternity and gives life to everything within it, creating differences through numbers and appointed times. On Earth, time is marked by changes in the air, heat, and cold. In Heaven, it's measured by the stars' return to the same positions and their journeys through time. The universe is nurtured by the flow and movement of time, which is regulated and brings order. This order and time ensure the renewal of everything in the universe through cycles.

2. This passage is quoted in the original Greek by Stobaeus, Florilegium, under the heading "Of Hermes from the [Sermons] to Asclepius." It explains that death is often feared as the greatest evil due to lack of understanding. Death is the breaking down of the body when it can no longer sustain life, leading to the loss of physical sensation.
3. Necessaria.
4. According to the Egyptian Hermes in "The Perfect Sermon," souls that act impiously are punished after death, being cast into zones of fire and hail, known as Pyriphlegethon and Tartarus.I doubt very much that this is a "quotation." If we compare it with D. M., iv. 31 (W. 90, 24), which only vaguely echoes the teachings of chapters iv, v, and xxvii, we will see that Tartarus and Pyriphlegethon are entirely the creation of Laurentius himself. The passage reads:

"In the Egyptian Hermes' Sermon called Perfect, it is said that the Avenging daimones, present in matter itself, punish the human part according to its actions; while the Purifying daimones in the air cleanse the souls after death that are trying to ascend, guiding them through the stormy and fiery zones of the air, which poets and Plato in the Phaedo call Tartarus and Pyriphlegethon. The Saving daimones, stationed in the lunar space, save the souls."

Menard quotes a couple of lines from Empedocles (circa 494-434 B.C.), cited by Plutarch, but without giving any reference. These lines are from the famous passage beginning "estin anagkes xreima k.t.l." (369-382), which Fairbanks translated. See Fairbanks (A.), The First Philosophers of Greece (London, 1898), p. 205:

"There is a decree of Necessity, an ancient law of the Gods, eternal, sealed with broad oaths: Whenever someone defiles their body sinfully with bloody gore or commits perjury, one of those spirits destined for a long life, they will wander for thirty thousand seasons apart from the blessed, being born in various mortal forms, changing one bitter path of life for another. Mighty Air pursues them to the Sea, and the Sea throws them onto the Earth, and the Earth casts them into the Sun's rays, and the Sun into the eddies of Air: one receives them from the other, and all hate them."I am now one of those too, a fugitive from the gods and a wanderer, at the mercy of raging Strife.

Compare with the Vision of Thespesius (Aridaeus) in Plutarch's "De Sera Numinis Vindicta": He saw that the shades of notorious criminals who had been punished in their earthly lives were not dealt with as harshly as those who lived in undetected vice under a guise of virtue. The latter were surrounded by retributory agents and forced, with labor and pain, to reveal their true souls.

This Aeon, created great by the great and perfect Father, serves as the Guard and Wall of protection [Paling or Stockade—xarakuma, the Roman vallum] of the Aeons, forming the Boundary (oros) of the Pleroma, and holding the thirty Aeons together within itself. These thirty form the divine creation." (See F. F. F., p. 342.)

Refers to the Aeon.

Receptaculum.All things, therefore, are constantly changing and nothing is stable or fixed, whether in Heaven or on Earth. Only God is unchanging and immovable. He exists within Himself, by Himself, and is entirely complete. He cannot be moved by anything or anyone else. 

In God exist all spaces, and He is present in all of them. Some might argue that God's movement is within Eternity, but in reality, He represents the immovable Eternity itself. All time's movements return to Eternity and originate from it.

God has always been unchanging, and Eternity has always been with Him. This Eternity contains the uncreated Cosmos, which we refer to as the Sensible God. This Cosmos is an image of the transcendent Deity, imitating Eternity.

Time, despite being in constant motion, has its own form of stability because it continuously returns to itself. Thus, although Eternity is stable and motionless, Time's continual motion, which is circular, makes it seem as if Eternity is moving. This means that Eternity's stability appears to be in motion, and Time's motion appears stable.

Therefore, we can understand that God is perpetually moving within Himself by the transcendent nature of His motion.For stability in His vastness remains motionless; His vastness exempts His law from change.

3. That which transcends all, beyond sense, beyond bounds, cannot be grasped, transcends all evaluation; it cannot be supported or traced.

Where, when, whence, and how He is, is known to none. He is upheld by His supreme stability, which is within Himself alone, whether this mystery is God, Eternity, or both together.

Just as Eternity transcends Time, so Time, in being boundless by number, change, or revolution, is of the nature of Eternity. Both seem boundless and eternal. Thus, stability, though fixed, can sustain motion and holds the highest place due to the good it does through its firmness.

1. The principals of all that exist are God and Aeon.

The Cosmos, being moveable, is not a principal.

For its mobility exceeds its stability by treating immovable fixation as the law of everlasting movement. The Whole Sense of Divinity, though immoveable, sets itself in motion within its stability. It is holy, incorruptible, and everlasting, possessing the supreme attribute of Eternity of God, containing the fullness of all things, sense, and knowledge, existing with God.

2. The Cosmic Sense contains all sensibles, species, and sciences.The higher human sense lies in the power of memory, allowing us to recall everything we have done.

This divine Sense is unique to humans because God did not want it mixed with other animals, to avoid any shame from mingling with lesser beings. Regardless of the quality or extent of a person's intelligence, it all depends on the ability to remember the past. It is this memory that has made humans the rulers of the earth.

Our understanding of Nature's intelligence comes from the Cosmic Sense, perceiving everything in the Cosmos. Regarding Eternity, the second sense, we understand it through our senses and perceive its nature similarly. However, the true essence of God's Supreme Sense is pure Truth, which cannot be fully grasped in the Cosmos, where we see falsehoods, births, deaths, and mistakes.

Asclepius, you see our foundation, what we focus on, and our aspirations. I thank God for enlightening me to see Divinity! Tat, Asclepius, and Ammon, keep the divine mysteries hidden in your hearts and speak nothing of their secrecy!

Our intellect differs from our senses because the mind can reach the intelligence and understanding of the Cosmic Sense. The Cosmic Intellect, however, extends to Eternity and the knowledge of the Gods above it.And so it happens that humans perceive the things in Heaven as if through a mist, limited by the capacity of our senses. It's true that our ability to understand such profound things is currently very limited, but it will be much greater when we can perceive them with the joy of true self-awareness.### XXXIII

1. On the topic of a "Void," which many consider extremely important, I have the following perspective: Nothing is, has been, or ever will be void. The entire Cosmos is completely full. The Cosmos is filled with bodies of various qualities and forms, each having its own type and size. Among these bodies, some are larger and stronger than others. Naturally, the stronger and larger ones are more easily seen. The smaller or more minute ones are barely perceptible, if at all, and we can only sense their existence through touch. This leads many to mistakenly think these smaller bodies aren't there and that there are empty spaces, which is impossible.

2. Regarding what is called Extra-cosmic Space, if it exists (which I doubt), it is filled by Him with Intelligible things, similar in nature to His own Divinity. Just as this Sensible Cosmos is filled with bodies and animals suited to its nature and quality, the shapes of these bodies aren't always visible to us. Some appear larger or smaller than they are, either because of the great distance between them and us or because our vision is weak. As a result, they seem minute, or people think they don't exist at all due to their extreme thinness.I am referring to the daimones, who, I believe, live among us, and heroes, who reside in the purest part of the air above us and the earth, where it is always clear and no star's movement disturbs the peace.

Because of this, Asclepius, you should not call anything void unless you specify what it is void of, such as fire, water, or similar things. Even if something seems void of these elements, whether it is small or large, it cannot be void of spirit and air.

Similarly, we must consider "Space," a term that by itself lacks meaning. Space is defined by what occupies it. If you remove the defining element, the sense is lost. Therefore, it is more accurate to say "space of water," "space of fire," or "space of other things." Just as nothing can be truly void, Space itself cannot be identified without defining dimensions like length, breadth, and depth, similar to how we describe human bodies.

Therefore, Asclepius, and those with him, understand that the Intelligible Cosmos (the one perceived by the mind alone) is without a physical body. Nothing physical, defined by qualities, quantities, and numbers, can be mixed with its nature. This Intelligible Cosmos is different from the Sensible Cosmos, which contains all physical things, species, qualities, and bodies.None of these can come to life without God. God is everything, and everything exists through His will. He is pure goodness, wisdom, and unchanging, something only He can fully comprehend. Without Him, nothing has existed, exists now, or will exist. Everything originates from Him, exists in Him, and is sustained by Him—qualities, quantities, and forms beyond measure. If you understand this, Asclepius, you will be grateful to God. Observing the universe as a whole, you will learn through true reason that the cosmos is knowable and that everything in it is enveloped by a higher cosmos.

Every kind of living thing, whether mortal or rational, with a soul or without, has its own class and images. Even though animals of the same class share forms, individual members differ. Likewise, humans can be recognized by their general appearance, but individual humans still differ from each other despite sharing a common form. The divine idea is bodiless and is understood by the mind. Thus, even though forms and bodies come from bodiless sources, no two forms are exactly alike because the moments of their creation are different. They change as often as the moments within the hour of the revolving Circle, where the God we call All-formed resides.The species, then, persists, continually producing as many and as diverse images as there are moments in the Cosmic Revolution—a Cosmos that constantly changes in its cycle. However, the idea itself remains unchanged and unaltered. Thus, the forms of each genus are permanent yet distinct within the same general form.

1. Asc. And does the Cosmos have a species, O Thrice-great one?
Tris. Do you not see, Asclepius, that everything has been explained to you as if you were asleep? For what is the Cosmos, or what does it consist of, if not all things that are born? This can be said of heaven, earth, and elements. Although other things undergo more frequent changes of species, even heaven experiences changes such as becoming moist, dry, cold, hot, clear, or dull—all within one type of heaven. These are frequent changes into species.

2. Earth, too, constantly changes its species—whether she brings forth fruits or nourishes her offspring with the return of all the fruits. The diverse qualities and quantities of air, its stagnations and flows; and especially the qualities of trees, flowers, berries, scents, and flavors—these are species. Fire also brings about numerous and divine transformations. These are all-formed images of the Sun and Moon; they are like our mirrors, reflecting back the likenesses of our own images.### XXXVII

1. But now let this be enough about such matters; let us return to discussing man and reason, which is a divine gift and the reason man is called a rational animal. The things said about man are less surprising, though they are still remarkable. The most astonishing of all is that man has been able to understand the nature of the Gods and make use of it.

2. Our earliest ancestors were greatly mistaken, as they had no rational belief about the Gods and did not pay attention to their worship. They discovered an art through which they made Gods for themselves.

By combining this invention with a power derived from cosmic nature, and since they could not create souls, they attempted to summon the souls of daimons or angels. They attached these souls to their sacred images and holy rituals, so that the statues would have the power to do good or harm.Your ancestor, Asclepius, was the first to discover medicine. He has a temple on Mount Libya near the crocodile shore, where his body rests. His spirit, however, has returned to heaven, where he now heals the sick through his divine power, just as he used to do with his medical skills.

Hermes, my ancestor, watches over and helps all who seek him. Osiris' wife, Isis, bestows many blessings when she is pleased, but can also cause harm when she is angry. The earthly and cosmic gods can easily be enraged because they are made of both physical and spiritual elements.

The Egyptians call certain animals "sacred" because they believe the souls of holy individuals reside in them. Each state serves these sacred animals and follows laws related to them, often naming the states after these animals. This is why some animals are worshipped in certain states but not in others, leading to conflicts between different Egyptian states.

Asclepius then asks about the nature of earthly gods. Hermes explains that they consist of plants, stones, and spices, which contain divine qualities. These gods are pleased with sacrifices, hymns, praises, and harmonious music.So that what is of heavenly nature, being drawn down into images through heavenly use and practices, can endure joyfully the nature of humanity and stay with it for long periods. This is how man creates the Gods. But do not think, Asclepius, that the actions of earthly Gods are random. The heavenly Gods dwell in the heights of Heaven, each fulfilling and watching over their assigned roles. Our Gods, on the other hand, by looking after certain things, predicting others through oracles and prophecy, and helping where needed, act as allies to humans, almost like relatives and friends.### Modern English Version

**XXXIX**

1. [XIV. M.] Asclepius: What role does Fate, or Heimarmene, play in the grand scheme of things, Thrice-greatest one? Don’t the celestial gods oversee general matters, while the earthly gods handle specifics?

Trismegistus: What we call Heimarmene, Asclepius, is the necessity governing all things that come into being, bound together by interlinked chains. This could be the force behind everything, the highest God, or a second God created by the highest God, or the discipline governing all things in heaven and on earth, established by divine laws.

2. So, Fate and Necessity are inseparably connected. Fate initiates everything, while Necessity ensures the completion of everything that starts. Order follows these principles, weaving everything together and arranging time to perfect all things. Nothing exists without the blend of Order.

The Cosmos is perfect in all aspects, as it is either carried by Order or entirely made up of Order.

**XL**

1. Therefore, these three—Fate, Necessity, and Order—are directly influenced by God's Will, who governs the Cosmos through His Law and Divine Reason. As a result, all actions, whether willing or unwilling, align with God's Will.They are not influenced by anger or favoritism, but act as instruments of Eternal Reason's self-compulsion, which is the Reason of Eternity and cannot be diverted, changed, or destroyed. 

First, there is Fate, which plants the seed and provides the embryo for all that will be. Next comes Necessity, which forces everything to reach its destined end. Third is Order, maintaining the structure of all things arranged by Fate and Necessity.

This is Eternity, which neither begins nor ends, and remains constant in its unending motion. It rises and sets in cycles, so that through Time's changes, it often rises with the same parts it once set. Its cyclical nature means everything is so tightly connected that no one can determine the start of its revolution; everything appears to precede and follow itself forever. Good and bad outcomes are mixed in all cosmic things.And with them follow Order and Law, and there is nothing without order. (See Exodus 1:15 and Exodus 11:1). Mundus means cosmos, which also means order in Greek. Gestatur means carried. Divinitus means by divine intervention. The Aeon is referenced here. Fate seems to be viewed as the Creator, Order as the Preserver, and Necessity as the Destroyer or Regenerator. Membra refers to parts, likely constellations. Volubilitatis refers to their turning into themselves, symbolized by the serpent swallowing its tail. Eventus et fors means outcomes and chance.

4. [XV. M.] And now you have been told each point as much as humanly possible, as God has willed and allowed. The only thing left for us to do is bless God and give Him praise; then we can return to caring for our bodies. We have now been sufficiently filled with the feast of the mind from our discussion on sacred things.

[p. 388]

XLI

1. When they came out from the holy place, they turned their faces towards the south as they began their prayers to God. When the sun is setting, one should face that direction to pray to God, and at sunrise, face the spot beneath the sun.

As they began their prayer, Asclepius whispered:

[Asc.] Let us suggest to Father, Tat, to do what he told us to—say our prayer to God with added incense and ointments. When Thrice-Greatest heard this, he became distressed and said:

2. [Tris.] No, no, Asclepius; speak more fitting words! Offering incense and the rest while praying to God is like profaning our sacred rites. God needs nothing, as He is all things, or all things are in Him. 

But let us worship by giving thanks.This is the best offering to God: when people give thanks to Him.

We thank You, the highest and most excellent! By Your grace, we have received the great light of Your knowledge. O holy and unique Name, worthy of worship, by which the Only God is blessed through honoring You, who graciously provides everyone with a father's care, love, and all virtues. You have given us sense, reason, and intelligence: sense to perceive You, reason to discover You through the appearances of things, and recognition to rejoice in knowing You.

Saved by Your divine power, we are grateful that You have shown Yourself to us completely. We rejoice that You have consecrated us, even while still in our bodies, to eternity. The highest praise worthy of man is to know Your Majesty. We have known You; with the single sense of our intelligence, we have perceived Your supreme light—O true Life of life, O fruitful Womb that gives birth to every nature!

We have known You, O You who are filled with the concept of Universal Nature! We have known You, O Eternal Constancy! In our entire prayer in worship of Your Goodness, we ask only this favor from Your goodness: that You keep us constant in our love of knowing You and never let us be cut off from this way of life. With this desire, we now begin our pure and fleshless meal.**COMMENTARY**

**THE TITLE**

The titles in the Latin manuscripts vary. Hildebrand prefers "Asclepius, or a Dialogue of Thrice-greatest Hermes," while the Bipontine edition titles it "Thrice-greatest Hermes Concerning the Nature of the Gods; A Sermon addressed to Asclepius." Menard, the French translator, prefers "A Sermon of Initiation, or Asclepius." The treatise starts with what is likely a marginal note from a scribe or student that mistakenly became part of the text. It reads, "This Asclepius is my Sun-god," implying, "This Sermon 'Asclepius' has enlightened me." This suggests that the original title was simply "Asclepius," as seen in section 2: "It is, however, with thy name I will inscribe this treatise." Stobaeus, quoting from the original Greek (xxvii. 4), titles his extract simply, "Of Hermes from the [Sermons] to Asclepius." However, the Church Father Lactantius, writing in the early fourth century and quoting from the Greek original, states twice (D. I., iv. 6 and vii. 8): "Hermes in the Book entitled 'The Perfect Sermon,' or 'The Sermon of Initiation.'" Johannes Laurentius Lydus also refers to this "Perfect Sermon" of Hermes three times, each time using this name. Therefore, I have chosen this as the main title, adding "The Asclepius" as an alternative.

**THE OLD LATIN TRANSLATION AND THE GREEK ORIGINAL**

We have quotations or references to the Greek original by Lactantius (see viii. 1 and 3; xxv. 4: xxvi. 1; xli.).Johannes Laurentius Lydus and Stobaeus have quoted some Greek texts. When we compare these Greek quotations with our Latin translation, we find that the Latin version is quite loose, with many additions and omissions, often missing the original Greek meaning. Additionally, there were likely several versions of the same Greek text.

The free nature of the Latin translation makes it hard to draw any solid conclusions about the date or historical value of the original text.

However, the ancient nature of our Latin translation is confirmed by Augustine's direct quotes from it, which means it existed by around 400 A.D.

Tradition has attributed the translation to the famous writer Apuleius, dating it to the first half of the second century. Modern critics have questioned this, and Reitzenstein, without delving into the matter, agrees with the skepticism and refers to a "Pseudo-Apuleius." Hildebrand, who is well-versed in Apuleius' style, has examined the issue thoroughly. Although he leans against the tradition, he does so reluctantly. The translation, even if not by Apuleius, is in old African Latin, and nothing in its style completely rules out the possibility that it was written by the author of The Golden Ass and an initiate of Isis. The main argument against tradition, apart from language analysis, is that Augustine does not mention Apuleius as the translator, but this argument seems weak.It's obviously challenging to turn possibilities into probabilities, but I see no reason why the Greek original of our Sermon shouldn't be placed among the earlier Hermes-Asclepius dialogues. Its fame is clear from its frequent citations and the existence of multiple versions of the Greek text.

**About the Writer and the Characters of the Dialogue**

The Latin translator keeps several original Greek technical terms. If we could fully trust his translation, we would find evidence suggesting that the original writer wanted his readers to think he was Egyptian, using non-Greek terms, as seen in the Corpus Hermeticum (CH) xvi. For instance, in vii. 2, "the man 'essential,' as the Greeks say," could be a note from the Latin translator. In x. 2, "So that 'World' seems most appropriately called 'Cosmos' in Greek," appears to be from the original. The "multifarious reasoning" in xii. 3 strongly reminds us of "the philosophizing of the Greeks—the noise of words," in CH xvi. 2. Conversely, the phrase "which we in Greek believe to be the Cosmos" might suggest the author forgot his Egyptian role. The terms "its bottom is called in Greek A-eides" and "in Greek they are called Hades, in Latin Inferi" (xvii. 3) might be annotations by the translator. In xxiv. 1, the sentence, "Don't you know, Asclepius, that Egypt is the image of Heaven? This land of ours is the shrine of the whole world," along with the rest of the chapter and Ch. xxv., could hardly have been written by a Greek. Moreover, in xxviii. 1, the "weighing of the merit" of the soul and the references to image and animal worship are distinctly Egyptian.Regarding the characters in the dialogue, I believe the sermon was initially meant for Asclepius alone. Later, minor narrative elements were added to make it suitable for a broader audience. Asclepius is clearly the main student; he is already knowledgeable about Nature, as stated in C. H., xiv. (xv.) 1. This means he has moved beyond merely listening and now questions Hermes. In contrast, Tat only listens and doesn't ask questions, indicating he is still a learner (i. 1). Ammon joins them at Asclepius's suggestion and is included because he had already received much written information, but had not yet participated in oral teachings. The lesson takes place in a solemn setting, possibly a holy place or shrine (i. 2), and the teacher and students form a "sacred four." Hermes teaches in an inspired state, the place is filled with a divine presence, and "Love Divine" teaches them through Hermes, responding to their pure love of philosophy (cf. xii. 3; xiv. 1).

The same person who wrote the warning against revealing the sermon to others in i. 2 likely also wrote: "And you, Tat, Asclepius, and Ammon, keep the divine mysteries hidden in your hearts and speak of them to no one!" (xxxii. 4). This person probably also added "and those with him" to "Asclepius" (xxxiv. 2) and included Asclepius’s whispered remark to Tat (xli. 1). If our analysis is correct, this editor was part of a select ascetic community, as suggested by the final sentence (xli. 5). This means Ammon was likely not a king but represented a certain level within this community, similar to the Exoterici of the Pythagoreans or the outer circles of the Essenes, where members still lived in the world but received instruction.In this case, the "we" in the last sentence should be understood as referring to Asclepius and Tat, not Ammon. Regarding the influence of this sermon on other literature, I find more connections between it and the "The Key" sermon addressed to Tat in Corpus Hermeticum, Book 10 (or 11). However, none of the references I provided show any literal dependence.

THE DOCTRINE OF THE WILL OF GOD

In the general doctrine, special attention is given to the concept of the Will of God. This Will is almost personified and is a fundamental aspect of Trismegistic religio-philosophy.

In chapter 26, verse 1, it is identified with God's Goodness and Nature. But it seems most closely related to the Aeon or Eternity concept, which is explained clearly in chapters 30 to 32—more clearly than anywhere else in Trismegistic literature. God and Aeon are the sources of all things; Aeon is described as "the Eternity of God, truly existing, the Fullness of all things" (chapter 32, verse 1). The Will of God is thus the Aeon or Pleroma, the Wisdom, the Energy, the Spouse of the Supreme. This Will governs the Cosmos with Law and Holy Reason (chapter 40); the Cosmos is the Order of things governed by Fate and Necessity, which are instruments of the Divine Will.

Our sermon frequently uses the terms Spirit and Sense.

CONCERNING SPIRIT AND THE ALL-SENSE

The Spirit is clearly both Cosmic Life (chapter 6, verse 4; chapter 27, verse 1) and individual life (chapter 10, verse 4). The explanation begins in chapter 14, verse 2; Spirit and Matter, or the Nature of the Cosmos (chapter 14, verse 3), are viewed as the Positive and Negative, or Masculine and Feminine Energies of the Divine. Spirit is the Ruler (chapter 17, verse 1) of all things in the Cosmos or Nature; it is the immediate Instrument of the Will of God (chapter 16, verse 3), and is often loosely identified with that Will (chapter 19).Spirit is loosely symbolized as "Heaven" and the Physical Universe as "Earth." It's likely that the idea of Spirit as Divine Breath originated from Egyptian beliefs, not from Semitic influences. The use of the term "Sense," which seems to be superior to "Reason," is notable. This contrasts with the usual emphasis on Reason found in other philosophical texts, suggesting an Egyptian perspective.

In our current discussion, this concept of "Sense" is highlighted. It refers not to individual senses but to a unified, Cosmic Sense. This "Divine Sense of intelligence" exists only in God and human reason. It's described as the "Higher Sense" that nourishes the mind and is a unique gift to humanity. This "Higher Sense" is something a person perceives with their mind, beyond their ordinary senses. It is connected with Nature and the Universe, helping humans discipline their souls and enhance their intellect, ultimately achieving "intelligence of God-like Reason." By doing so, humans can merge with the "All-sense of the Divine Intelligence," which is the same as the "Whole Sense of Divinity" and represents the Likeness of God. This divine Likeness is stable yet dynamic and is identified as the Aeon or Intelligible Cosmos. In humans, its main characteristic is memory, which enables humans to govern the Earth.This sense is man's continuous awareness, the seed of his eternal nature, the foundation of his consciousness, the singular aspect of intelligence that is fully realized only when a man is completely immersed in the awareness of life—the "spiritual life" of the Christian Gnostics. Since we are working with a translation, we can't focus too much on the details, but the general idea is clear. Similarly, for the rest of this lengthy sermon, we must only consider the main points, especially the "prophetic" statements.

The Prophetic Statements

These statements are very difficult to interpret, and so far, I have not seen or come up with any solutions. Much work has been done on similar contemporary prophetic statements, especially in the Sibylline Literature, leading scholars to agree that the idea of genuine prophecy should be dismissed. In the Sibylline texts, this is evident because much of it is traditional history written in a prophetic style. When the historical narrative ends, the time of the "prophetic" writer becomes clear, as the following content no longer relates to historical events. However, with our "prophecies," we have no such guide. All we can say is that they likely were written during a time when the Trismegistic communities were facing persecution.It seems to me that Reitzenstein's idea that this occurred in the fourth century lacks solid evidence. Not only does it force us to think the prophecies were added later (which is possible), but also that these additions came after Lactantius. However, it is highly probable that Lactantius, who wrote at the beginning of the fourth century, had access to these texts.

[p. 399]

Meanwhile, Zosimus, who wrote around the end of the third and beginning of the fourth century, doesn't mention any persecution and suggests that the community was thriving. Therefore, we remain in significant doubt. The first prophecy in xii. 3 says, "For I will tell thee as though it were prophetic," addressed to Asclepius, and likely not added by the later editor who included narrative sentences. The writer laments that "the Single Love, the Love of Pure Philosophy," is disappearing from the world. He probably wasn't thinking of Christianity when he wrote this since he contrasts "Pure Philosophy" with "multifarious reasoning" and "divers sciences," which aren't typical of mainstream Christianity. If his words apply to Gnostic Christianity, he clearly wasn't in favor of it. However, this seems unlikely given the close similarities between Trismegistic and Christian Gnosis.

As for the proscription of the worship of the gods, xxiv. 2 clearly states that the worship of the Gods will be legally banned by the "barbarian" rulers of Egypt, as also mentioned in xxv. 3.A significant ban on worship in this strong sense occurred in Egypt only when the Christians destroyed the Serapeum in 389 A.D.

[p. 400]

We find clear evidence of Roman authorities persecuting Christians in Egypt before this time in the writings of the Christian Gnostic Basilides, who lived in Alexandria at the start of the second century and wrote about martyrdom. However, this doesn't help us much in understanding the ban on a cult that supported the worship of gods and their images. Is it possible that these prophetic statements were written when many similar ones were being made by Jews and Christians? Like Jewish and Christian writers, our author believed the "End of the World" was near; his expectation matched that of the New Testament writers. He thought this catastrophic event would be caused by Egypt, the "shrine of the whole world" and the "Holy Land," being corrupted by sin and violence. The worship of the gods would end, and the gods would leave Earth for Heaven. He felt deep sorrow for Egypt, just as a Jew would for Jerusalem. If there are any historical references in his emotional statements, we must look at phrases like: "This holiest land, seat of our shrines and temples, shall be choked with tombs and corpses" (xxiv. 3); "the number of graves will far exceed the number of the living" (ibid., section 4); and "Egypt shall be made the home of Scythian or Indian, or someone similar—a foreigner." It is true that Christians were often criticized

[p. 401]

for worshipping the dead and building churches over graves—an act seen as utter pollution by Pagans—but even with exaggeration, our author's words can hardly be interpreted this way.People like the Scythians or Indians, if we consider any historical context, are unlikely to be referring to the Romans. The Goths under Alaric, who invaded Greece in 395-396 A.D., are also too late for Reitzenstein's timeline. Additionally, we have noted the unusual pairing of Scythian and Barbarian in our text, similar to what is found in Colossians. On the other hand, only the complete suppression of Pagan Religion in all its forms can explain xxv. 3, which fits the end of the fourth century. If we can't accept such a late date—and I believe we can't—we must give the writer credit for predicting the future, as events eventually unfolded much as he imagined or feared.

THE LAST HOPE OF THE RELIGION OF THE MIND

Regardless, the last hope for Pure Love, the Religion of the Mind, lies in the Trismegistic Communities, if we interpret xxvii. 3 correctly:

"Indeed, those who rule the earth will be spread throughout the lands and eventually gathered in a state at the top of Egypt, founded towards the west, to which all humanity will hasten." We don't need to focus on exact details, as our translator may have deviated from the original text. For example, "race" might have originally meant the "Race" we've heard so much about in Philo and these writings. However, the similarity of the idea reminds us of Philo, who wrote about the Redeemed of Spiritual Israel:

"Those who were scattered in Greece and non-Greek (Barbarian) lands, across islands and continents, will rise with one impulse and gather from different regions to the one revealed spot."Now, compare this with the famous passage on the Therapeuts:

"This group of people can be found in many parts of the world, both Greek and non-Greek, participating in the Perfect Good. In Egypt, there are many of them in every province, especially around Alexandria. The most advanced among them come to what they consider their homeland, the Therapeutic homeland.

Furthermore, just as Philo mentions that the Therapeuts have a community on a hill, our text also mentions that the Trismegistic communities have their main center on the Libyan Hill. This community is described as 'very large' in numbers, which seems to contradict the earlier statement that 'they may be counted even in the world,' unless that statement is meant to be rhetorical.

This hill is called the Libyan Mount, a vague name. The vagueness remains even when it is later referred to as the burial place of the body of the First Asclepius, near 'the shore of crocodiles.' This likely does not refer to Crocodilopolis in the Fayyum, the northernmost town with that name, since the Libyan Mount is described as 'at the top of Egypt's upper part' and 'towards the setting sun.' This matches well with the location of Philo's Therapeut community on the southern shore of Lake Mareotis, just south of Alexandria. However, few people will likely consider that Philo and our author might be talking about the same people from different perspectives and under different names. There is no certainty in this matter, so I leave it as an intriguing problem that has not yet been solved."The opinions of Bernays and Zeller, as established, are considered by Reitzenstein (p. 195) to be of little value, similar to the views that made all of our literature dependent on Neoplatonism. Augustine lived from 354 to 430 A.D.

Refer to C. H., xiii. (xiv.) 14. For references to the "few," see xxii. 1; xxiii. 1; xxxiv. 3; xl. 1. Refer to vii. 3; viii. 2; xi. 4; xiv. 1; xvi. 3; xix. 4; xx. 3; xxii. 4; xxv. 2; xxvi. 1, 2, and 3. Especially refer to C. H., iv. (v.) 1; x. (xi.) 1. In the Greek text of Lactantius, this is referred to as "the Good." Also refer to vi. 1; xiv. 3. Additionally, see C. H., xiii. (xiv.) 19, 20, and R. 39, n. 1. Refer to C. H., x. (xi.) 13, and Commentary. See xxv. 4, and note. "The image of the Heaven"; refer to K. K., 46-48. This language is very different from the more moderate tone of C. H., ix. (x.) 4, where it is mentioned about the Gnostics, "they are thought mad and laughed at; they are hated and despised, and sometimes even put to death." Refer to De Execrat., section 9; M. ii. 435, 436; P. 937 (Ri. v. 255). In our Sermon, xxv. 1, Egypt is referred to as "the sole colony of holiness." Refer to D. V. C., C. 56 ff; M. i. 474; P. 892. Also, refer to F. F. F., 69.

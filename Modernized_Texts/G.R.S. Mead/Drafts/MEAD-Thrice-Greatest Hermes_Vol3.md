#### Excerpt I. Of Piety and True Philosophy
(Title from Patrizzi (p. 4); preceded by "Of Thrice-greatest Hermes." Text: Stobaeus, Phys., xxxv. 1, under heading: "Of Hermes--from the Book to Tat"; G. pp. 273-278; M. i. 190-194; W. i. 273-278. [*1]

Menard, Book IV., No. i. of "Fragments from the Books of Hermes to his Son Tat," pp. 225-230.) [*2]

**Page 4**

Her. Both for the sake of love to man and piety to God, I now, my son, for the first time take pen in hand. [*4]

For there can be no piety more righteous than to know the things that are, and to give thanks for these to Him who made them, which I will never cease to do.

Tat. By doing what, O father, then, if nothing is true down here, may one live wisely?

Her. Be pious, son!Those who are pious reach the highest level of philosophy; without philosophy, one cannot achieve true piety. Whoever understands what things exist, how they are ordered, by whom, and for what purpose, will be grateful to the Creator, like a good father, an excellent nurturer, and a trustworthy steward.

Those who give thanks will be pious; and those who are pious will know where truth is and what it is. As they learn, they will grow more pious. Once a soul has grasped the truly Good and True, it cannot fall back into the opposite. When the soul knows the source of its peace, it is filled with love and forgets all evil, unable to stray from the Good.

Let this be your goal of piety, my son. If you achieve this, you will live nobly and depart from life happily, for your soul will know where it should go. This is the only way to Truth, the path our ancestors took to find the Good.

This path is solemn and smooth but difficult for a soul still in a body. The soul must first struggle against itself, causing a great conflict, and ensure that one part of itself triumphs. There is a battle between the soul's desire to ascend and its earthly bonds trying to hold it down.

The victory of one part over the others is not equal. The part that seeks the Good ascends, while the others settle downward toward the bad. One part longs for freedom, while the others love their captivity.If both are defeated, they lose themselves and their leader; but if only one is defeated, it is tormented by the other two and suffers in this life. This, my son, is the one who guides you on the higher path. You must first leave your body behind before its end, and emerge victorious in life's struggles, then make your way home as a victor.

Now, my son, I will summarize the key points; you will understand if you remember what you have heard. Everything is in motion; only what does not exist is exempt from it.

Every body changes; not all bodies can dissolve; only some can. Not every animal is mortal; not every animal is immortal. What can dissolve can be destroyed; what is permanent is unchangeable and eternal. What constantly becomes is constantly destroyed; what becomes once is never destroyed and never changes into something else.

First is God; second is the cosmos; third is man.

The cosmos exists for man's sake, and man exists for God's sake. The irrational part of the soul is mortal; the rational part is immortal. All essence is immortal and unchanging. Everything that exists is dual in nature; nothing remains the same. Not everything is moved by the soul; the soul moves everything that exists.

Everything that suffers can perceive; not everything that can perceive, suffers. Everything that feels pain also experiences pleasure, a mortal life; not everything that experiences pleasure feels pain, an immortal life. Not every body is subject to disease; all bodies that are subject to disease are also subject to dissolution.

The mind is in God; the reasoning faculty is in man.The mind is the source of reason and is above all suffering. Nothing in the body is true; only the bodiless is free from falsehood. Everything that comes into being is subject to change, but not everything that comes into being needs to be destroyed. Nothing on earth is good; nothing in heaven is bad. God is good; man is bad.

Goodness is a choice; evil is against the will. The gods choose what is good as good. The good law of the Mighty One is the good law; the good law is the law.

Time belongs to the gods; the law belongs to men.

Evil sustains the world; time brings man to an end. Everything in heaven is free from change; everything on earth is subject to it. Nothing in heaven is a slave; nothing on earth is free. Everything in heaven is knowable; nothing on earth is fully known. Earthly things do not align with heavenly things.

Everything in heaven is free from blame; everything on earth is blameworthy. The immortal is not mortal; the mortal is not immortal. Not everything sown is brought forth, but everything brought forth must have been sown.

For a body that can be dissolved, there are two periods: from sowing to birth, and from birth to death. But for an everlasting body, there is only the time from birth onward.

Things that can dissolve grow and decay. Material that dissolves undergoes two contrary transformations: death and birth. But everlasting material changes either into itself or into things like itself. The birth of man is the beginning of his dissolution; man's dissolution is the beginning of his birth. What departs returns, and what returns departs again.

Of existing things, some are in bodies, some in forms, and some in activities. The body is in forms; form and energy are in the body.The immortal does not partake in the mortal; the mortal partakes in the immortal. The mortal body does not ascend into the immortal realm; the immortal descends into the mortal body. Actions do not rise up; they come down.

15. Earthly things do not benefit heavenly things; heavenly things bestow every benefit on earthly things. Heaven contains everlasting bodies; the earth contains perishable ones. Earth is irrational; heaven is rational. Heavenly things are beneath it; earthly things are above the earth.

Heaven is the first element; earth is the last element. Foreknowledge is God's Order; Necessity serves Foreknowledge. Fortune represents disorder and false opinion. What is God? The unchanging Good. What is man? The bad that can change.

16. If you remember these points, you will also remember what I have explained to you in greater detail before. These are summaries of those teachings. However, avoid discussing these matters with many people; not to keep them to yourself selfishly, but so you do not appear foolish to the masses.

Like attracts like; unlike is never friendly to unlike. Very few will listen to such words, and possibly not even those few.

These words have a unique power; they provoke the bad to become worse. Therefore, you should protect the many from themselves, for they do not understand the power of these words.

17. Tat: What do you mean, father?
Her: This, my son! All that is animal in man is more inclined to bad than to good; it coexists with bad because it is in love with it.If this animal were to realize that the universe is governed by creation and destruction, with everything happening according to Foreknowledge and Necessity, and ruled by Fate, it would soon become even worse than it is now. It would scorn the universe for being subject to creation and Fate, blaming all bad things on these forces, and would never stop committing evil acts. Therefore, it is important to keep them ignorant, so they become less bad out of fear of the unknown.

COMMENTARY

Patrizzi valued this excerpt so much that he included it in the first book of his collection. However, he mistakenly identified the dialogue participants as Asclepius and Tat instead of Hermes and Tat—a mistake followed by all the editors of Stobaeus except Wachsmuth. The treatise, introduced as a letter to Tat, is actually a form of oral instruction with questions and answers. In section 16, it is revealed that the definitions in sections 7-15 summarize previous teachings. Similarly, in Corpus Hermeticum, Book 10 (or 11), there is an abridgment of general teachings delivered to Tat. The headings in our sermon may summarize the Expository Sermons to Tat, as seen in Cyril's fragments. Some definitions are similar to those in Corpus Hermeticum, Book 10 (or 11), suggesting that "The Key" could be part of or a continuation of the Expository Sermons.The caution to exercise great care when sharing knowledge with the general public, due to the risk of educating those who are morally unsuitable, seems to be a fitting conclusion to the sermon. Thus, we can be fairly sure that the above text is a complete treatise of "The Expository Sermons to Tat." However, the title was created by Patrizzi and is not original.

#### EXCERPT II. [ON THE INEFFABILITY OF GOD]

(I have added the title, as the excerpt is not found in Patrizzi. Text: Stob., Flor., lxxx. [lxxviii.] 9, under the heading: "Of Hermes from the [Book] to Tat"; G. iii. 135; M. iii. 104, 105.)

Menard, Book IV., No. x. of "Fragments from the Books of Hermes to his Son Tat," p. 256.Understanding God is difficult, and speaking about Him is impossible. The bodiless cannot be described in bodily terms, and the perfect cannot be fully understood by the imperfect. It's challenging for the eternal to interact with the temporary. One is forever, while the other passes away; one is in the clarity of truth, and the other in the shadow of appearance. The weaker is far from the stronger, as the lesser is far from the greater, and the mortal is far from the divine. This distance dims our vision of the Beautiful. We can see bodies with our eyes and talk about what we see with our tongues, but that which has no body, is unmanifest, and without form, cannot be comprehended by our senses. I believe, Tat, that what cannot be spoken of is God.

COMMENTARY

Justin Martyr quotes these opening words exactly, attributing them to Hermes. The essence of the second sentence is cited twice by Lactantius in Latin; in one passage, he quotes the first sentence verbatim and notes that they begin a sermon from Hermes to his son, Tat. The first four sentences are also quoted almost exactly by Cyril, who also provides additional lines beginning with "If, then, there be an incorporeal eye," suggesting further insight into the text.If Fragment 33 is from the same sermon, then this sermon is the "First Sermon of the Expository Sermons to Tat," and the Stobaean heading, "From the Book to Tat," refers to the collection of Expository Sermons (see Comment on Fragment XV).

Excerpt III. On Truth

(Title from Patrizzi, preceded by: "Of Thrice-Greatest Hermes to Tat." Text: Stob., Flor., xi. 23, under the heading: "Of Hermes from the Sermons to Tat"; G, i. 307-311; M. i. 248-251; H. iii. 436-441. Menard, Book IV., No. IX. of "Fragments from the Books of Hermes to his Son Tat," pp. 251-255.)

1. [Hermes.] Concerning Truth, O Tat, it is not possible for man to speak boldly, for man is an imperfect creature, made up of imperfect parts, his body assembled from many different elements. But this much I can say—that Truth is found only in eternal things, those things that are true in themselves—fire that is purely fire, earth that is purely earth, air that is purely air, and water that is purely water.

Our bodies, however, are a mixture of all these elements. They contain fire, earth, water, and air, but they are not purely any of these elements, nor are they truly any single thing. If our composition did not begin with Truth, how can we see or speak the Truth? We can only have a notion of it, if God wills.

2. Thus, all things on earth, O Tat, are not the Truth; they are only copies of the True. And these are not even all things, but just a few; the rest are made up of falsehood and error, Tat, and illusions resembling images.Whenever appearances receive influence from above, they become a reflection of Truth. Without this influence, they remain false. Just like a portrait represents a body but is not an actual body, even though it appears to have eyes, it cannot see or hear. The portrait also has other features, but they deceive the viewers into thinking they see the truth when they actually see something false. Those who do not see the falsehood see the truth. If we understand and see things as they truly are, we genuinely comprehend and see. But if we see things contrary to their true nature, we neither understand nor know anything true.

[Tat.] Is there truth on earth, father? [Her.] You are mistaken, son. Truth is not on earth, nor can it be. However, some people can have an idea of it if God grants them the power of divine vision.

So, there is no truth on earth—that much I know and say. Everything is just appearances and illusions—I know and speak the truth. We should not call the knowledge and speaking of true things the Truth itself.

[Tat.] How can we know and speak of true things if nothing is true on earth?

[Her.] It is true that we do not know anything true down here. How could we, son? For Truth is the most perfect virtue, the highest Good, undisturbed by matter, not confined by a body—naked, evident, unchanging, august, and unalterable Good. But things on earth, son, are not capable of receiving this Good. They are corruptible, perishable, changeable, and continuously altering, being born from one another.Things that are not true even to themselves cannot be true at all. Anything that changes is untrue because it does not remain the same and presents different appearances over time.

Tat: And what about humans, father? Are they true?
Her: Humans are not true, my son. The true is that which is composed only of itself and remains unchanged. Humans are made of many things and are constantly changing, from age to age and form to form, even while still in the same body.

Many people do not recognize their children after a short time, and children often do not recognize their parents. Something that changes so much that it is no longer recognizable cannot be true. Instead, it is false, constantly changing its appearance. True things stay and last forever. Since humans do not last forever, they are not true. "Human" is just an appearance, and appearances are extremely untrue.

Tat: But what about external bodies, father? Since they change, are they not true?
Her: Anything subject to birth and change is not true. However, they have true matter because they are created by the Forefather. Even so, they have an element of falsehood because they change. Nothing that does not remain the same is true.

Tat: I understand, father. Should we then say that the Sun alone is true because it changes less than the others and stays more constant?
Her: No, but the Sun is special because it is responsible for the creation and regulation of all things in the cosmos. I give reverence and worship to the Sun for its truth and recognize it as the creator after the One and First.**Modern English Version:**

**Tat:** What then, father, would you say is the ultimate Truth?

**Hermes:** The One and Only, Tat. He is not made of matter or found in a body. He has no color, no shape, and never changes. He is constant and eternal. On the other hand, falsehood perishes. All things on Earth that perish are understood and encompassed by the True. Birth cannot happen without decay; decay follows every birth so that new birth can occur. Things that are born must come from things that are destroyed, and things that have been born must be destroyed again to ensure the cycle of existence continues. Recognize this as the work of the Demiurge, the creator of birth and death for all things.

**8.** Things born out of destruction must necessarily be false because they are constantly changing. They can never remain the same. How can something that is not constant be true? We should consider such things as appearances. For example, we should call a man an appearance of a man, a child an appearance of a child, a youth an appearance of a youth, an adult an appearance of an adult, and an old man an appearance of an old man. Man is never truly a man, nor child a child, nor youth a youth, nor adult a man, nor old man a single old man. As they change, they are untrue, both in their past and present states. Think of them as energies stemming from the Truth itself. Thus, even falsehood is a manifestation of the Truth.### EXCERPT IV. [GOD, NATURE, AND THE GODS]

1. **Hermes:** There exists something that goes beyond being—beyond all that exists and all that truly is. This transcendent being is the mystery behind the existence of "being-ness," which is considered universal and common to both intelligible entities and those thought of according to the law of sameness. Those which are contrary to these, according to the law of otherness, exist in their own way.

And Nature is an essence that the senses can perceive, containing within itself all that is sensible.

2. **Between these** are the intelligible and the sensible gods. Things related to intelligence share the nature of the intelligible gods, while those related to opinion have their part with the sensible gods.The following text has been modernized and simplified without altering its original meaning:

These latter are representations of the intelligences; for example, the Sun is a representation of the Creator God above the heavens. Just as He made the universe, the Sun creates animals, generates plants, and regulates the life forces.

COMMENT

I have added the title for consistency. If we compare this extract with Excerpt VII, particularly the last sentence of the former with the first sentence of section 2 of the latter, and note that in Stobaeus one excerpt follows almost immediately after the other, we can be fairly sure they both come from the same collection—namely, the Sermons to Tat.

Footnotes

1. Or "the pre-existent."
2. Essentiality.
3. This likely refers to the seven spheres of difference moving symbolically against or "crosswise with" the all-encompassing sphere of sameness, or it may mean that their motions are self-contained.
4. Presumably God and Nature.
5. A very rare form, possibly meaning perceptible.
6. Or spirits. The last clause, "and regulates," etc., is missing from some manuscripts and is therefore considered spurious by some editors. However, its unexpectedness strongly suggests it is genuine. The "spirits" are the pranas of Hindu physiological psychology.

EXCERPT V

[OF MATTER]

(I have added the title, as it matches the main section of Stobaeus. Patrizzi only gives the simple heading "From the [Sermons] to Tat." Text: Stobaeus, Phys., xi. 2, under the heading: "Of Hermes from the [Sermons] to Tat"; G. p. 121; M. i. 84, 85; W. i. 131. Menard, Book IV., No. viii. of "Fragments from the Books of Hermes to his son Tat," p. 250.)Matter has both existed and been created, my son. Matter acts as the vessel for creation, while creation is the expression of God's energy, who exists without the need for creation and pre-exists everything. Matter, by receiving the seed of creation, came into existence and became subject to change. As it changed, it took on different forms, shaping itself. Matter's formless state was its initial condition, and its creation is its activation.

Footnotes:

1. The idea of a container or field for birth was a familiar symbol to the Pythagoreans, who used the term "metaggismos" (pouring water from one vessel to another) as a synonym for reincarnation.
2. The Christian Gnostic commentator mentioned by Hippolytus referred to "formless essence" as the cause of all forms.

EXCERPT VI. ON TIME

1. Now let's explore the concept of the three times; they neither exist independently nor are they entirely unified, yet they are both unified and independent. If you consider the present without the past, it cannot be present unless it has already become past. The present arises from the past, and the future emerges from the present. To understand this more deeply, let us analyze further:

2.Past time ceases to exist, and future time does not exist because it is not present; even the present is fleeting. Time is constantly moving and has no fixed point to stop. How can it be called 'present' when it cannot stand still? Past, present, and future are interconnected and form a continuous whole. Therefore, time is both continuous and discontinuous, yet remains the same.

EXCERPT VII. OF EVERLASTING AND PERISHABLE BODIES

The Lord and Creator of all eternal bodies, Tat, made them once and no more. He does not create them now. He entrusted them to themselves and united them with each other, making them self-sufficient and everlasting.If they lack anything, it will be the lack of each other and not the need for more members from outside, since they are immortal.

This is because bodies created by Him must have such a nature. Our Demiurge, however, who is himself in a body, has made us—and will continue to make—bodies that are corruptible and subject to death. It would not be right for him to imitate his own Creator, especially because it is impossible. The Creator made from the original, bodiless essence, while the Demiurge created from the bodily essence brought into existence by his Lord.

Therefore, it follows logically that while those bodies, being created from incorporeal essence, are free from death, our bodies are corruptible and subject to death because our matter is made of physical bodies, as seen from their weakness and need for support. Our bodies could not last without receiving nourishment from similar elements to renew them daily. We have a continuous flow of earth, water, fire, and air into us, which renews our bodies and keeps us together. We are too weak to endure the motions of our bodies, not even for a single day. If our bodies did not rest at night, we would not last a single day.

Therefore, our Maker, being good and knowing all things, has given us sleep to ensure our survival. Sleep is the greatest relief from the fatigue of motion, and he has allotted equal or even more time for rest. Consider well, my son, the powerful energy of sleep—it is the opposite of the soul's energy but equally important. Just as the soul is the energy of motion, bodies cannot live without the help of sleep.Sleep provides relaxation and rejuvenation for the body. It helps to absorb and allocate new nutrients: water to blood, earth to bones and marrow, air to nerves and veins, and fire to vision. This is why the body feels a deep sense of pleasure during sleep, as sleep activates this pleasurable process.

Patrizzi's title does not accurately describe the main content of the excerpt, which is clearly from the Sermons of Hermes to Tat, similar to previous extracts taken by Stobaeus from the Expository Sermons.

Footnotes:
1. Refers to the creator of our non-eternal bodies.
2. Possibly refers to the Sun; see related references in C. H., xvi. 18; and Ex., iii. 6 and iv. 2; and Lact., D. I., iv. 6.
3. Refers to the concept of embodiment.
4. Refers to the elements.

The body is often described as the temporary dwelling of the soul. For example, Plato and the Pythagoreans used the term "skeinos" to denote the body as the soul's tent. This idea is supported by the Oracle at Delphi's response about Plotinus's soul after death, which describes the soul leaving its earthly tent.

EXCERPT VIII. OF ENERGY AND FEELING

This title, from Patrizzi, precedes "Of Thrice-greatest Hermes." The text is from the Sermons to Tat, documented in various sources.**Tat:** You’ve explained things well, Father. Now, please teach me more. You mentioned before that science and art are what define rational energy.

But now you say that irrational beings live without rationality, and therefore, they are called irrational. Following this logic, it seems that irrational beings have no part in science or art because they lack rationality.

**Hermes:** Yes, that’s correct, my son.

**Tat:** But Father, how do we see some irrational creatures using intelligence and art? For example, ants store food for winter, birds build nests, and animals know their own homes.

**Hermes:** These actions, my son, are not due to science or art but are driven by nature. Science and art can be taught, but none of these irrational creatures are taught anything. Things done by nature happen because of the general energy of the universe. Actions based on science and art are performed by those who have knowledge, not by everyone. Nature drives actions that are common to all.

For example, everyone can look up to the sky, but not everyone is a musician, archer, or hunter. Some have learned these skills through science and art. Similarly, if only some ants stored food and others did not, you could say they did it through knowledge and art. But since all ants do this naturally, even if it's against their will, it’s clear they do it not through science or art, but by nature.For Tat, these energies, although they are incorporeal, are found in bodies and act through them. Therefore, Tat, since they are incorporeal, you say they are immortal; but because they cannot manifest activity without bodies, I say they are always in a body. Things created for a purpose or under Providence and Fate can never remain inactive in their proper energy. What exists will always be, for this being is the body and its life.

It follows that these are always bodies. Thus, I say that "bodying" itself is an eternal exercise of energy.

If bodies are on earth, they are subject to dissolution; yet they must be on earth to serve as places and organs for the energies. The energies, however, are immortal, and the immortal is eternal, meaning body-making is energy.

The energies accompany the soul, though not all at once. Some energize a person at birth, united with the irrational parts of the soul; while the purer ones cooperate with the soul's rational part as one ages. But all these energies depend on bodies. From divine bodies, they descend to mortal ones; these body-making energies are always active, either around the body or the soul. They are even active with the soul itself without a body. They are forever active. The soul, however, is not always in a mortal body, as it can exist without a body; whereas the energies can never be without bodies.

This is a sacred saying, my son: A body without a soul cannot persist; its being can.

Tat: What do you mean, my father?

Her: Understand it this way, Tat! When the soul leaves the body, the body itself remains.Even the body, once abandoned by the soul, remains active as long as it exists, breaking down and disappearing. A body without energy couldn't go through these processes.

This energy stays with the body even after the soul has left. The difference between an immortal body and a mortal one is that the immortal body is made of a single matter, while the mortal one is not. The immortal body is active, whereas the mortal body is passive. The active force is stronger and leads, while the passive one is weaker and follows.

Energies affect both living and non-living bodies like plants, stones, and other objects. They make these bodies grow, bear fruit, ripen, dissolve, melt, rot, and crumble, enabling all activities that bodies without souls can undergo. Energy is the force that drives all these processes, the force of becoming. Everything is constantly in a state of becoming because the universe always contains all things and perpetually bears them, even as they are destroyed and renewed.

Understand that energy of every kind is always free from death, regardless of what it is or in which body it resides. Some energies belong to divine bodies and some to corruptible ones; some are general, and some are specific. Some are related to entire categories of beings, while others pertain to parts of these categories. Divine energies operate through eternal bodies and are perfect because they work through perfect forms. Partial energies, on the other hand, work through individual living beings.Special energies are those that activate through every existing thing. This argument, therefore, my son, suggests that everything is full of energies. Since energies must be present in bodies, and there are many bodies in the universe, I say there are more energies than bodies. Often, one body can have multiple energies or activities, besides the general ones it naturally has. By general ones, I mean the purely physical ones that work through sensations and movements. Without these energies, an animal's body cannot survive.

However, human souls have another type of energy—special ones that manifest through arts, sciences, practices, and deliberate actions.

Feelings follow energies or are the completion of energies. Understand, my son, the difference between energy and sensation. Energy comes from above, while sensation, existing in the body, receives the energy and makes it visible, as if embodying it. Therefore, sensations are both physical and mortal, lasting only as long as the body does. Sensations are born with the body and die with it.

Immortal bodies, however, have no sensation, not even an immortal one, as they are not composed of any essence that changes. Sensation arises only from additions or subtractions to the body, whether good or bad. Eternal bodies do not experience additions or subtractions, so they do not have sensations.

Tat: Do all bodies feel sensation? 
Her: Yes, all bodies, my son; and energies are active in all of them. 
Tat: Even in bodies without souls, father?Even in those cases, my son, there are differences in sensations. Rational beings experience feelings with reason, while irrational beings have purely physical sensations. Things without a soul also have sensations, but they are passive, only experiencing growth and decline.

Furthermore, passion and sensation originate from the same source and are interconnected through energies. For beings with souls, there are two other energies associated with sensations and passions: grief and joy. Without these, a being with a soul, especially a rational one, could not experience sensation. Therefore, I say there are forms of passions that affect rational beings more significantly. Energies are the active forces in sensations, while sensations are the manifestations of these energies.

Additionally, since these sensations are physical, they are influenced by the irrational parts of a person's soul, which makes them harmful. Joy, although it brings pleasure temporarily, often leads to many problems for the one experiencing it. Grief, on the other hand, causes even greater pain and suffering. Thus, both joy and grief can be harmful.

Tat: Father, can sensation be the same in both soul and body?

Her: What do you mean by sensation in the soul, my son?

Tat: Surely, the soul cannot be incorporeal if sensation is a physical thing, father—sensation which can exist in a body and sometimes not, just like the soul?

Her: If we were to place sensation in a body, son, we would compare it to the soul or to energies, as these are incorporeal entities within bodies. But since sensation is neither energy nor soul, nor anything other than a physical phenomenon, it cannot be incorporeal.If something isn't incorporeal, it must be a body. Among things that exist, some must be bodies and others incorporeal.

COMMENT

In earlier editions of Stobaeus, the dialogue participants were named Asclepius and Tat instead of Hermes and Tat. Wachsmuth has identified them correctly. The second sentence is particularly interesting because it likely refers to C. H., x. (xi.), 22: "God's rays, metaphorically speaking, are his energies; the Cosmos's are natures; and the arts and sciences are man's." Since "The Key" is a summary of the General Sermons to Tat, this statement might also have appeared in one of those sermons. Thus, the existence of these General Sermons is implied, suggesting that our excerpt could be from one of the Expository Sermons to Tat. Stobaeus has clearly left out the beginning and possibly the end of the Sermon.

**Excerpt IX: On the Decans and the Stars**

Patrizzi (p. 38b) does not include the first part of the text (sections 1-5), and his title, "On the Stars," seems incomplete; it is followed by "To the Same [i.e., Tat]." The text is from Stobaeus, Physics, xxi. 9, under the heading: "Of Hermes from the Sermon to Tat," pages 184-190; M. i. 129-133; W. i. 189-194. Menard, Book IV., No. vi. of "Fragments from the Books of Hermes to his Son Tat," pages 242-247, under the sub-heading, "Of the Decans and the Stars."

1. **Tat:** Since in your previous General Sermons, father, you promised to explain the Thirty-Six Decans to me, please explain their nature and activity now.

2. **Hermes:** I have no desire to refuse you, Tat, and this should be the most authoritative and important sermon. So, give it careful consideration.We have already talked to you about the Circle of the Animals, or the Life-giving one, the Five Planets, the Sun and Moon, and the Circle of each of these.

Tat: You have, Thrice-greatest one.

Her: Now, I want you to understand about the Thirty-Six Decans as well. Remember what we discussed earlier so you can understand this part too.

Tat: I remember, father.

Her: We said, my son, there is a body that encompasses everything. Imagine it as a spherical shape; that's how the universe is formed.

Tat: I have imagined it in my mind just as you described, father.

Her: Beneath the Circle of this encompassing frame are the Thirty-Six Decans, positioned between the Circle of the Universe and that of the Animals. They determine the boundaries of both Circles and hold the Circle of the Animals up in the air, defining it. They share the motion of the Planetary Spheres but have equal power to the main motion of the Whole, crossing the Seven. They are only limited by the All-encircling Body, which is the final thing in motion itself. But they move more slowly than the Circle of the All. Think of them as Watchers overseeing the Seven Circles and the Circle of the All, maintaining order in the world.

Tat: I understand, father, from what you say.

Her: Also, Tat, remember that they are free from the constraints placed on the other Stars.They are not stopped or redirected in their paths, nor are they delayed or made to retrace their steps. They are not kept away from the Sun's light, unlike the other stars. Free and superior, as if they were flawless guardians and overseers of everything, they encircle the universe day and night.

Tat: Do they also influence us?

Her: Absolutely, my son. If they affect the stars, how could they not impact us as well, both individually and collectively?

So, my son, many events that occur generally are triggered by them. For example, the fall of kingdoms, state rebellions, plagues, famines, tidal waves, and earthquakes—none of these happen without their influence.

Moreover, remember this: if they govern the stars and we are beneath the Seven, don't you think some of their activity affects us too, since we are their offspring or come into existence through them?

Tat: What kind of bodies do they have, father?

Her: Many call them daimones, but they are not a special class of daimones. They don't have unique bodies made of different matter, nor are they moved by a soul as we are. They are simply the operations of the Thirty-six Gods. Also, keep in mind, Tat, that they plant the seeds of those whom men call Tanes in the earth—some acting as saviors, others as destroyers.

Furthermore, the stars in heaven also have their own roles and assistants. They have ministers and warriors too.They are in eternal interaction and move through the ether, filling all its space so there are no empty areas without stars. They act as the cosmic machinery of the universe, each with their own specific actions, yet subordinate to the influence of the Thirty-six, from whom come the deaths of all other living beings with souls and many lesser lives that harm the harvest.

Below them lies what is called the Bear, situated in the middle of the Zodiac, made up of seven stars with another Bear above it. It acts like an axle, neither setting nor rising, but remaining in the same place and rotating, giving motion to the Life-producing Circle. It transitions the whole universe from night to day and from day to night. Beyond this, there is another group of stars to which we haven't given names, but future generations will name them as they see fit.

Below the Moon, there are other stars that are corruptible and lack energy. They persist for a short time because they are exhaled from the earth into the air. These stars are constantly breaking apart, similar to useless earthly creatures like flies, fleas, and worms, which exist only to die. These creatures and stars are not useful to us or the world; instead, they trouble and annoy, being nature's by-products born from her excess.

Similarly, the stars exhaled from the earth do not reach the upper space.They cannot do so, since they come from below. Due to their heavy weight, they are pulled down by their own matter and quickly disperse, falling back to Earth, only disturbing the air around it.

There is another type, O Tat, known as long-haired stars or comets. These appear at specific times and soon become invisible again; they do not rise or set or break apart. These are the bright messengers and heralds of future events. They occupy the space below the Sun's path. When something significant is about to happen in the world, comets appear, shine for a few days, and then return behind the Sun's path, remaining invisible. Some appear in the east, some in the north, some in the west, and others in the south. We call them Prophets.

Such is the nature of the stars. However, stars differ from constellations.

Stars move in the sky, while constellations are fixed in the sky's framework, moving along with it. Twelve of these constellations are called the Zodiac.

He who understands these can gain some idea of what God is. If one dares to say so, becoming a seer for himself, he can contemplate God, and in doing so, be blessed.

Tat: Truly blessed is he, O father, who contemplates Him.

Her: But it is impossible, O son, for someone in a body to have this good fortune. One should train his soul now, so that when it reaches the place where it can contemplate, it does not lose its way. Men who love their bodies will never see the Vision of the Beautiful and Good.

For what, O son, is that Beauty which has no form, color, or mass?Is there anything beautiful beyond these? Only God, my son, or rather the greater name of God.

COMMENTARY

Previous editors of Stobaeus (likely following Patrizzi's mistake) incorrectly identified Asclepius instead of Tat as the second person in the dialogue, which the text itself disproves (see Hermes' first sentence and sections 9 and 10).

This passage is from a sermon addressed to Tat. It further explains topics generally mentioned in the General Sermons; hence, it likely comes from the Expository Sermons series, which also includes sermons on the Zodiacal Twelve and the Seven Spheres. Since this sermon is described as "most authoritative and the chiefest of them all," it probably concluded one of the Books of the Expository Sermons. We seem to have the beginning of the sermon, but not the end, as Stobaeus abruptly stops in the middle of a discussion. For a list of the Egyptian names of the Decans, with their Greek transcriptions and symbols, see Budge, Gods of the Egyptians, ii. 304-308.

^47:3 This refers to the astronomical system behind the Pythagorean-Platonic tradition, symbolically set forth by Plato in The Timaeus (36 B, C).The Demiurge divided the entire compound lengthwise into two parts. He joined these parts at the center in the shape of an X and bent them into a circular form, connecting them at the point opposite their original meeting point. By encompassing them in a uniform revolution on the same axis, he created an outer circle and an inner circle. He called the motion of the outer circle "the motion of the same" and the motion of the inner circle "the motion of the other" or "diverse."

The X represents "crosswise," which can be interpreted as "inverse to" in terms of motion.

The rest of the fragment touches on other elements, such as the Decans, fixed stars, planets, eclipses, energy, and the Seven Spheres. Additionally, it mentions spiritual and other spaces and their inhabitants, questioning their types and referring to them as either beneficial or harmful. There is a suggestion that the text is faulty and that "Tanas" might be a shortened form of "Titanas" or Titans, related to the concept of being "stretched out" or "striving."Lydus, *De Mensibus*, iv. 31 (W. 90, 24), as noted in P.

[p. 55]

EXCERPT X.### Concerning the Rule of Providence, Necessity, and Fate

**Of Fate (From the Sermons to Tat)**

1. **Tat:** Father, you've explained everything well. Now, could you remind me what Providence governs, what Necessity controls, and what is under Fate?

**Hermes:** I mentioned that within us, Tat, there are three types of incorporeal things. The first type consists of things only the mind can understand; they are without color, shape, or mass and come from the First Essence, perceived only by the mind.

The second type opposes the first and consists of configurations, which the first type contains.

When something is set in motion by the Primal Essence for a specific purpose of Reason (Logos) and is conceived by it, it transforms into another form of motion; this is the image of the Demiurgic Thought.

2. There is also a third type of incorporeal things that exist around bodies—space, time, motion, figure, surface, size, and species. These have two sets of characteristics. The first set includes qualities inherent to themselves: figure, color, species, space, time, and movement. The second set relates to the body: configured figure, colored color, and conformed form, surface, and size.

The latter set does not share qualities with the former.

3. The Intelligible Essence, along with God, has control over itself and another because it maintains itself. Essence in itself is not subject to Necessity.When it is abandoned by God, it adopts a physical form. This choice is guided by Providence, meaning it opts for the material world.

Everything irrational is driven by some form of reason. Reason falls under Providence, irrationality falls under Necessity, and physical events are governed by Fate. This is the essence of the sermon on Providence, Necessity, and Fate.

COMMENT

The title is derived from the final words, indicating the end of the sermon. Stobaeus appears to have included the entire text of this short treatise, which should be read in conjunction with examples xi, xii, and xiii. Hermetic Corpus xii (xiii) 6 seems to reference this sermon.

Footnotes

5. More abstract than shapes or forms, such as types or prototypes.
6. Acts as matter or a nurturing entity.

EXCERPT XI. [OF JUSTICE]

(I have added the title; this excerpt is not found in Patrizzi. Text: Stobaeus, Physical, iii. 52, under the vague heading: "Of Hermes"; G. p. 50; M. i. 33, 34; W. i. 62, 63. Menard, Book IV., No. iv.)**Modern English Version:**

**Fragments from the Books of Hermes to his Son Tat, p. 240**

1. Hermes: There is a powerful spirit, my son, that moves throughout the universe and sees everything people do on Earth. Just as Foreknowledge (or Providence) and Necessity govern the realm of the gods, Justice oversees humanity, influencing their actions. The divine realm is governed by entities that cannot make mistakes because divinity cannot be led astray. Therefore, it is incapable of error.

Justice, however, is tasked with correcting the mistakes humans make on Earth. Since humans are mortal and made from flawed material, they naturally make errors, especially those who cannot perceive the Divine.

Justice has special authority over these individuals. They are subject to Fate due to the circumstances of their birth and to Justice for their errors in life.

**Commentary**

This excerpt belongs to the Tat-Sermons and in Lactantius' collection likely came before the Sermon of Hermes to Tat, "About the General Mind."

**Excerpt XII. Of Providence and Fate**

(Title from Patrizzi (p. 38); followed by: "From the [Sermons] to Ammon.")### Modern English Version

#### Excerpt from Hermes to Ammon

All things are born through Nature and Fate, and there is no space without Providence. Providence is the Self-perfect Reason. This Reason has two spontaneous powers: Necessity and Fate. Fate serves both Providence and Necessity, while the Stars serve Fate. No one can escape Fate or hide from the scrutiny of the Stars.

The Stars act as instruments of Fate, carrying out its will for both nature and humanity.

#### Excerpt on the Whole Economy

What supports the whole World is Providence. What holds it together and surrounds it is called Necessity. What drives everything and keeps it moving is Fate, which enforces Necessity. Fate is the cause of birth, death, and life.

The Cosmos is under the influence of Providence, as it is the first to encounter it. Providence itself extends to Heaven.For this reason, the Gods constantly move and revolve around Heaven with tireless, never-ending motion. Fate extends throughout the Cosmos, and because of this, Necessity surrounds the Cosmos as well. 

Providence knows in advance, but Fate determines the arrangement of the Stars. 

This is the unchangeable law that governs everything.

EXCERPT XIV. OF SOUL

1. The Soul is an incorporeal essence. Even when it is within a body, it does not lose its essential nature. By its essence, it is always in motion. By its thought, it moves itself, not being moved by something else, nor towards something, nor because of something.It is more powerful and doesn't depend on what comes after. "In something" refers to space, time, and nature; "towards something" refers to harmony, form, and figure; "because of something" refers to the body, as it is because of the body that time, space, and nature exist.

All these things are interconnected by a natural relationship. For example, a body needs space because a body cannot exist without it. The body also changes in nature, and change cannot occur without time and the movement of nature. It is also impossible for a body to exist without harmony. Therefore, space exists because of the body; it accommodates the body's changes and prevents it from disappearing. The body continually changes from one state to another but remains a body. Although its specific state doesn't stay the same, the body itself remains.

Space is immaterial, as are time and natural motion, but each has its own unique property: space's property is receptivity, time's is interval and number, nature's is motion, harmony's is love, and the body's property is change. The unique nature of the Soul, however, is essential thought.

EXCERPT XV. [OF SOUL, II.] Text: Stob., Phys., xxxv. 7, under the heading: "Of Hermes from the [Sermons] to Ammon."The motion that moves everything is driven by the universal force. The nature of the universe provides all movement, with one type of motion based on its power and the other based on its operation.

The first type of motion spreads throughout the entire universe, holding it together from the inside. The second type surrounds and encompasses it from the outside. These two types of motion are present in all things simultaneously.

The productive nature of everything provides the ability to reproduce, planting seeds of itself and creating new things through the movement of matter. When matter is moved, it heats up and transforms into fire and water. Fire is strong and active, while water is passive. Fire, when opposed by water, dries up and becomes earth carried by water. When it is excessively dried up, vapor rises from water, earth, and fire, becoming air. The four elements—fire, water, earth, and air—combine harmoniously: hot with cold, dry with moist. From this union, spirit is born, and a seed forms in harmony with the surrounding spirit. This spirit, when it enters the womb, actively transforms the seed, leading to growth and development.

As it grows, it takes on a form modeled after a pattern. The spirit in the womb initially lacks the motion that sustains life but causes fermentation. Harmony then shapes this into a container for rational life.

This rational life is indivisible and unchanging; it remains constant forever.It governs the development of a fetus in the womb through numbers, delivers it, and brings it into the outer air. The Soul stays very close to it, not because of any shared property, but due to the force of Fate; for the Soul does not desire to be with the body.

Therefore, according to Fate, Harmony provides the newborn with rational motion and the intellectual essence of life. This essence penetrates the spirit and sets it in motion with the life force.

COMMENTARY

Patrizzi made a mistake by continuing this into Ex. xiv. without a break. The subject is not so much "Of Soul" as "Of Conception and Birth," but since the overall explanation fits well with the themes in Exx. xiv. and xvi., we can keep the same general title, even though it was likely not the original one. The explanation in section 2 has an apocalyptic style and appears to be a Greek adaptation of Egyptian ideas. Although the details differ and the precise meaning is hard to untangle, the general perspective can be compared with the embryonic stages of incarnation described in the Pistis Sophia.

THE EMBRYONIC STAGES OF INCARNATION

"Then the Rulers summon the workers of their aeons, numbering three hundred and sixty-five, and give them the soul and the counterfeit of the spirit bound together. The counterfeit of the spirit is outside the soul, and the compound of the power within the soul is inside both, so they may hold together. And the Rulers instruct the workers, saying: 'This is the form which you shall place in the body of the material world.'"Place the essence of the power within the soul inside all beings, as it is their support, and outside the soul place the imitation of the spirit. This is the instruction given to their workers, so they can set the representations in bodies. Following this plan, the workers of the Rulers combine the power, the soul, and the imitation of the spirit, and bring them into the world, passing through the realm of the Midst Rulers.

The Midst Rulers inspect the imitation of the spirit and also destiny. Destiny, which guides a person to their destined death, is attached to the soul by the Great Fate Rulers. The Sphere workers bind the soul with power, the imitation of the spirit, and destiny. The whole is divided into two parts, to surround both the man and the woman in the world, where the sign has been set for them. They give one part to the man and the other to the woman through the food they consume, whether it is airy, watery, or etheric.

When the workers of the Rulers have placed one part into the woman and the other into the man as described, even if the pair is far apart, the workers secretly compel them to be united in the world. The imitation of the spirit in the male comes to the part of itself sent into the man’s body, sacrifices it, and deposits it into the woman's womb as a seed of wrongdoing. Immediately, the 365 workers of the Rulers enter her to dwell within her. All the workers of the two parts are there together.The workmen monitor the blood from the food and drink the woman consumes and keep it in her womb for forty days. After forty days, they process this blood from the nourishment and carefully work it together in the woman's womb. 

Then, they spend another thirty days forming the body's parts to resemble a human. Each workman builds a specific part. I will explain the builders when I talk about the emanation of the pleroma. 

After seventy days, when the body is fully formed with all its parts, they first summon the counterfeit spirit into the body. Next, they summon the soul, and finally, they summon the compound of the power within the soul. The destiny is placed outside the body, as it is not mixed with them but follows and accompanies them. 

When the child's conception period is complete, the baby is born. The compound of power, the soul, and the counterfeit spirit are small in the newborn. However, the destiny, being vast, is not mingled with the body but follows the soul, body, and counterfeit spirit until the soul leaves the body according to the type of death decreed by the Rulers of the Great Fate.---

EXCERPT XVI. [OF SOUL, III.] (Title added; Patrizzi (p. 40b) only has the heading: "To the Same Ammon." Text: Stob., Phys., xli. 3, under the simple heading: "Of Hermes"; G. pp. 323, 324; M. i. 227, 228; W. i. 320, 321. Menard, Livre IV., No. v. of "Fragments of the Books of Hermes to Ammon," pp. 263, 264.)

1. The Soul is, then, an incorporeal essence; for if it had a body, it would lose its ability to sustain itself. 

Every body needs existence and an ordered life. Everything that is born must undergo change. 

That which comes into being grows in size and increases. [p. 73]

For everything that grows, decrease follows; and with increase comes destruction. By sharing in the form of life, it lives; it also shares in existence through the Soul.

2. But that which causes another to exist must first exist itself. By "existence," I mean becoming rational and participating in intellectual life.

---The Soul provides this intellectual life. It is called "living" because of its life force, "rational" because of its intellect, and "mortal" because of its body. The Soul is an incorporeal entity with the power to remain unchanged. Without an essence that provides life, we couldn't talk about an intellectual living being. Similarly, we couldn't say a being is rational without an essence that provides intellectual life.

Intellect does not extend to all forms of life; it depends on the composition of the body in relation to Harmony. If the hot element in the body is excessive, a person is energetic and passionate; if the cold element is excessive, a person is sluggish and dull. Nature adjusts the body's composition to fit the Harmony. There are three states of becoming: hot, cold, and balanced. Nature aligns the body's harmony with the ruling Star's influence. The Soul, as determined by Fate, provides the appropriate life force to this natural work. Nature thus harmonizes the body's composition with the Stars, creating mutual sympathy. The ultimate purpose of the Stars' Harmony is to foster this sympathy according to Fate.EXCERPT XVII. [OF SOUL, IV.] 

1. Soul, Ammon, is an essence that contains its own purpose within itself. From its beginning, guided by Fate, it adopts a way of life and draws to itself a reason similar to matter, possessing "heart" and "appetite."

"Heart" is also matter; if it aligns with the Soul's intelligence, it becomes courage and is not swayed by cowardice. "Appetite" is matter too; if it aligns with the Soul's rational power, it becomes temperance and is not driven by pleasure because reasoning fulfills the "appetite's" lack.

2. When both "heart" and "appetite" are harmonized, balanced, and made subordinate to the Soul's rational power, justice is born. This balance removes the excess of "heart" and compensates for the deficiency of "appetite." The source of these is the penetrating essence of all thought, working within its own reason that contemplates everything, using its own reason as a guide.

It is the essence that leads and guides as a ruler; its reason acts like a counselor who considers all things.

3. The reason of the essence is the knowledge of those reasonings that provide the irrational part with a semblance of reasoning—a faint reflection compared to reasoning itself, but still reasoning compared to the irrational, like an echo to a voice or moonlight to the sun.The concepts of "heart" and "appetite" are balanced in a rational manner. They counteract each other and thereby understand a unified purpose within themselves.

Footnotes:

In a metaphorical sense, "heart" and "appetite" originally refer to "anger" and "desire"—representing the excess and deficiency of animal nature, comparable to the rational nature’s "mind" and "understanding." See Ex. i. 5 and xviii. 3. These virtues are courage and temperance. The essence mentioned is the one that permeates all things through thought. 

EXCERPT XVIII. ABOUT THE SOUL

Every soul is immortal and constantly in motion. In the General Sermons, we stated that some motions arise from activities, while others come from physical bodies. The soul is produced from a certain essence, not material, and is itself incorporeal. Everything that is born must come from something. All things that experience destruction after birth must have two types of motion: the motion of the soul, which animates them, and the motion of the body, which causes growth and decay. Upon the soul’s dissolution, the body is also dissolved. This defines the motion of corruptible bodies.The Soul is always in motion, constantly moving itself and causing other things to move. Because of this, every Soul is immortal, as its motion is self-sustaining. There are three kinds of Souls: divine, human, and irrational.

1. The divine Soul resides in its divine body, where it is self-active. It moves within this body and also moves itself. When it frees itself from mortal existence, it separates from its irrational parts and joins its divine body. Being in perpetual motion, it moves in harmony with the universe.

2. The human Soul has a divine aspect but is also connected to irrational parts, such as desires and emotions. These irrational parts are immortal because they are active, but they are tied to mortal bodies. When the human Soul is in its divine state, it is far from these irrational parts. However, when it enters a mortal body, these irrational parts attach to it, maintaining its human nature.

3. The irrational Soul is made up of desires and emotions. These Souls are called irrational because they lack the reason of the Soul.

Additionally, there is a fourth type, the soulless, which acts on bodies from the outside, setting them in motion. Ideally, this should be the movement of itself within its divine body, influencing other things indirectly.

COMMENT

The reference to the General Sermons raises the possibility that our extract might be from one of the Sermons to Tat, as these General Sermons are mentioned in the Tat literature.The content is very similar to the excerpts from the Sermons to Ammon, so we include this excerpt with them.

EXCERPT XIX. [OF SOUL, VI.] (Patrizzi (p. 41b) continues this without a break. Text: Stob., Phys., xli. 6, under the heading: "Of the Same," meaning "Of Hermes"; G. pp. 327, 328; M. i. 229, 230; W. i. 324, 325. Menard, Livre IV., No. viii. of "Fragments of the Books of Hermes to Ammon," pp. 269, 270.)

1. Soul is an eternal intellectual essence, with the purpose of understanding itself. When it thinks, it draws in the intention of Harmony.

But when it leaves the body created by Nature, it remains by itself, the creator of itself in the intellectual world. It controls its own reason, holding within its thought a motion (called life) similar to that which comes into life.

2. The unique property of the Soul is to provide other things with what is similar to its own nature. Therefore, there are two lives, two motions: one according to the essence of the Soul, and the other according to the nature of the body. The former is more general, while the latter is more specific. The life according to essence has authority over itself, while the other is under necessity. Everything that is moved is under the necessity of what moves it. The motion that moves is closely connected with the love of the intellectual essence.The soul must be non-material—an essence that is not part of any physical body created by nature. If it were physical, it would lack reason and intelligence.

Every physical body is without intelligence. However, when it receives essence, it gains the ability to become a living being. The spirit has the power to perceive the body, and the essence has the power to perceive beauty.

The spirit, which can sense appearances, is distributed among various sense organs: one part allows us to see, another to hear, another to smell, another to taste, and another to touch. This spirit, when guided by understanding, can discern what is sensible. If not guided by understanding, it only creates images for itself because it is part of the body and receptive to all impressions.

The reason of the essence, on the other hand, is capable of judgment. Knowledge of things worth knowing coexists with reason, while opinion coexists with the spirit. The latter operates from the external world, while the former operates from within itself.

Comment:
Examples xvi.-xix. in Stobaeus likely come from the same group of sermons. Their content is similar to Examples xiv. and xv., which are stated by Stobaeus to be from the "Sermons to Ammon." It is reasonable to group them all together. We do not know how many "Sermons to Ammon" there were in the collection used by Stobaeus, and they might not have had distinctive titles. Stobaeus often omits titles when quoting, even when known from other sources, so we cannot draw definite conclusions from his silence.**EXCERPT XX. [THE POWER OF CHOICE]**

There is essence, reason, thought, and perception.

Opinion and sensation move towards perception; reason directs itself towards essence; and thought acts on its own. Thought and perception intertwine and merge into one form, which is the Soul itself. Opinion and sensation strive for the Soul's perception but do not stay constant. This causes excess, deficiency, and variation.

When opinion and sensation deviate from perception, they deteriorate. However, when they follow and obey perception, they share in perceptive reason through science.

We have the power to choose; we can choose better or worse according to our will. If our choice aligns with evil, it becomes associated with physical nature, and Fate governs the one who makes this choice.Since the intellectual essence within us is completely free—specifically, the reasoning ability that encompasses all thoughts—and it remains consistent and self-governing, Fate cannot affect it.

This intellectual essence, originating from the First God, gave rise to perceptive reasoning and the comprehensive reasoning that Nature bestows upon those born. The Soul engages with these forms of reasoning and their fates, though inherently it remains unaffected by the nature of these fates.

(Additional note from Patrizzi: The harmony that binds all parts together is essentially the same as what is destined by Fate.)

I have added a temporary heading for clarity. This excerpt appears to be part of a longer treatise, possibly one of the Sermons to Tat.

EXCERPT XXI. OF ISIS TO HORUS

(Title in Patrizzi is "From Isis." Text: Stobaeus, Florilegium, xiii. 50, under the heading: "Of Hermes from the Sermon of Isis to Horus"; G. i. 328; M. i. 265; H. iii. 467. Schow provides another heading, which Gaisford believes is from the Vienna codex: "Of Hermes from the Intercession (or Supplication) of Isis.")

This fragment clearly does not match the style of the "Sermon of Isis to Hermes" (Excerpt xxvii.); it more closely resembles C.H. xvi. or xvii., and is therefore likely from the "Sermon of Asclepius to the King." Footnotes

EXCERPT XXIII. FROM "APHRODITE"

(Title in Patrizzi (p. 45) is "The Likeness of Children," followed by: "From Aphrodite." Text: Stob., Phys., xxxvi. 2, under the heading: "Of Hermes from 'Aphrodite'"; G. pp. 297, 298; M. i. 207, 208; W. i. 295, 296. Menard, Livre IV., No. iii. of "Fragments Divers," p. 273.) [----] How, [then,] are offspring born resembling their parents? Or how do they return [*1] to their own species [*2]? [Aphrodite.] I will explain the reason. When generation stores up seed from the mature blood being excreted, [*3] it happens that an essence is somehow released from the entire body, following the law of divine activity, as though the man himself were being born; the same thing seems to happen with the woman. When the man's contribution prevails and remains intact, the offspring resembles the father; otherwise, it resembles the mother.

---

This revised version presents the content in a clearer and more contemporary manner while preserving the original meanings.Furthermore, if one part becomes dominant, the resemblance of the child will favor that particular part. Sometimes, for many generations, the offspring resembles the husband's form because his influence is stronger at the moment of conception.

This fragment is the only surviving example of a type of Hermetic literature, similar in form to the Isis and Horus type. The name of the person questioning Aphrodite is unknown.

- Literally means "body."

EXCERPT XXIV. [A HYMN OF THE GODS]

Seven stars, varied in their courses, revolve on the wide Olympian plain; with them, Eternity will always spin fate:--Mene that shines by night, gloomy Kronos, sweet Helios, Paphie carried in the shrine, courageous Ares, fair-winged Hermes, and Zeus, the primal source from whom Nature comes. These gods are entrusted with the care of humanity, so within us there is a part of Mene, Zeus, Ares, Paphie, Kronos, Helios, and Hermes. Thus, we draw from the ethereal spirit—tears, laughter, anger, birth, reason, sleep, and desire.Tears are Kronos, birth is Zeus, reason is Hermes, courage is Mars, and sleep is the Moon, truly, and desire is Venus, and laughter is the Sun--for it is because of him that every mortal and immortal being laughs.

This is the only known example of verses attributed to the Trismegistic tradition. Liddell and Scott, however, under "nyktifane's," do not question this attribution, while Clement of Alexandria praises the "Hymns of the Gods" of Hermes. On the other hand, in Anthol. Palat., the seventh verse is attributed to Theon of Alexandria.

Footnotes:

1. Or Aeon.
2. "epine'setai." But the Anthology reads "kai toisin aei kanonizetai"--that is to say, Eternity or Aeon is forever regulated or measured by the Seven; which seems to make no sense unless it means that the Seven are the instruments by which Eternity is divided into time.
3. That is, Venus, whose image was presumably carried in a small shrine during processions.
4. "arxigenethlos," meaning the primeval source.

EXCERPT XXV. THE VIRGIN OF THE WORLD

(Title in Patrizzi, in the Latin translation, "Minerva Mundi.")

Text: Stobaeus, Physica, xli. 44, under the heading: "From Thrice-Greatest Hermes' Sacred Book 'The Virgin of the World'"; G. pp. 395-419; M. i. 281-298; W. i. 385-407. Menard, Livre III., No. i. of "Fragments of the Sacred Book entitled 'The Virgin of the World,'" pp. 177-200.)Isis began to speak to Horus, giving him the first taste of immortality that souls receive from the Gods. She started her sacred speech:

"Son Horus, look at the heavens, adorned with many stars, which cover all things below. The cosmos has everything it needs, and every nature below must be organized and filled by those above. The lower cannot dictate the order to the higher. Hence, the lesser mysteries must give way to the greater ones. The order of the higher things is beyond human understanding and is always certain. Therefore, the mysteries below were in awe of the beauty and eternal nature of the ones above.

Heaven's beauty was worth seeing and admiring, resembling God, who was still unknown. The majesty of Night, weaving her web with light, although less bright than the Sun, and other heavenly mysteries, moved with ordered motions and times, influencing and ordering the things below.

Fear followed fear, and search followed search, until the Creator decided to reveal Himself. He breathed love into the Gods and poured the splendor from His heart into their minds increasingly. This made them first desire to seek, then yearn to find, and finally have the power to succeed."My dear Horus, my remarkable son, this could never have been accomplished if that seed were mortal, for it did not exist yet. It could only be achieved by a soul attuned to the mysteries of Heaven. This was the nature of all-knowing Hermes, who saw and understood everything, and had the power to explain and reveal his knowledge. He inscribed his wisdom on stone, but concealed much of it, ensuring that future generations would seek it out. He entrusted the gods with guarding this knowledge and then ascended to the stars.

Tat, his son and heir, succeeded him, followed by Asclepius-Imuth, as directed by Ptah (also known as Hephaestus), and others who sought the certainty of heavenly contemplation, as Foreknowledge, the queen of all, willed.

Hermes explained to the surrounding space that he had not been able to pass on the Perfect Vision to his son due to his youth. But when the Sun rose for me, and I observed the hidden mysteries of the New Dawn, I gradually became convinced that the sacred symbols of the cosmic elements were hidden near the secrets of Osiris.

Before Hermes returned to Heaven, he invoked a spell on these symbols and spoke these words. It is important, my son, that I share the proclamation Hermes made when he hid his books. He said:

"O holy books, made by my immortal hands and protected by incorruptible magic, remain free from decay and corruption for all eternity!"Become invisible and unfindable to all who walk the plains of our land until Heaven brings forth suitable instruments for you, whom the Creator will call souls. Thus he spoke; and, using his own powers, he safely hid them away in their own realms. They have remained hidden for a long time.

Nature, my son, was barren until those assigned to patrol the heavens approached the God of all, their King, and reported on the stagnation of things. The time had come for the cosmos to awaken, and this was only His task. "We pray You," they said, "consider the current state of things and what the future requires." When they spoke, God smiled and said, "Nature, arise!" And from His word came a marvel—feminine, perfectly beautiful, at which the Gods were amazed. God, the Forefather, named her Nature, honored her, and commanded her to be fruitful. Then, gazing at the surrounding space, He said, "Let Heaven, Air, and Aether be filled with all things!" God spoke, and it was so. Nature, understanding she must obey the Sire's command, created a beautiful daughter with the help of Toil, and named her Invention. God granted her life and filled all that had been created with mysteries, giving Invention the power to rule over them.

No longer wishing for the world above to remain inert, God decided to fill it with life, ensuring its parts would not remain inactive. He began this process with holy arts appropriate for creating His special work.God took breath from His own Breath and mixed it with knowing Fire. He combined these with other substances that had no ability to know. Using certain hidden words of power, He blended them together thoroughly. From this mixture emerged a substance that was much subtler, purer, and more translucent than the original components. It was so clear that only the Creator could see it.

This new substance, which didn't melt when exposed to fire (since it was made of Fire) and didn't freeze once formed (since it was made of Breath), maintained a unique and special composition. God named this composition "Psychosis" due to its favorable meaning and its distinctive behavior.

From this coagulated mixture, God created countless souls. He fashioned them with order and precision, ensuring that they were similar and not forced to differ from one another. The efflorescence that arose from the movement God induced varied in purity and fullness. The first efflorescence was the greatest and purest, the second was less so, and the third even less. This pattern continued up to sixty degrees.

Despite these differences, God decreed that all should be eternal, as if made from a single essence, with forms that only He could complete.Furthermore, He established boundaries and regulations in the higher realms of existence so that everything would function smoothly and in harmony, thus pleasing their Creator. In this most beautiful realm of the Aether, He gathered all the natures of the things He had created and addressed them:

"O Souls, beloved children of My own Breath and care, whom I have brought to life with My own Hands and dedicated to My world, listen to My words as if they were laws. Do not interfere with any space other than what I have designated for you by My will.

"If you remain steadfast, the Heaven, with its stars and thrones filled with virtue, will stay as they are for you. But if you attempt any changes against My decrees, I swear by My most holy Breath and by this mixture from which I created you, and by My Hands that gave you life, that I will quickly impose bonds and punishments upon you."

Having said these words, the God, who is my Lord, mixed the remaining elements (Water and Earth) together. As before, invoking certain powerful but not as potent words, He set them in motion and breathed life into the mixture. Taking the coagulate that formed on top, once it was well-mixed and consistent, He shaped from it creatures with forms similar to humans. The remaining mixture He allocated to the souls that had gone ahead to the lands of the Gods, regions near the Stars, and the holy daimones. He said:

"My sons, children of My Nature, create things!"Take the rest of what I have created, and let each of you make something that reflects your own nature. I will give these to you as models." He arranged everything neatly and according to the movements of the souls, creating the world of sacred animals. He linked animals that resembled humans with others in a specific order and gave these life forms the power to create and reproduce eternally. He promised to add invisible breath and essence to their creations, so they could give birth to others like themselves. These creations would continue to function as they initially did.

Horus asked, "What did the souls do then, mother?" And Isis replied:

"Horus, my son, the souls first studied the Father's mixture and tried to understand its composition, but it was difficult for them. They feared the Father's anger for their curiosity and decided to follow his instructions. They used the lighter part of the mixture to create birds. As the mixture hardened, they created four-legged animals from the firmer substance. Then they made fish from a less light material that needed water to swim in. Finally, from the cold and heavy residue, they created creeping creatures."Here is the modernized and simplified version of the text:

---

My son, they thought they had done something grand and, with reckless daring, armed themselves and acted against the orders they had received. They began to overstep their boundaries, refusing to stay in one place and believing that staying put was like death. However, my son, as Hermes told me, this did not escape the notice of the God and Lord of all things. He devised a punishment for them, which they now endure in misery. So, the Sovereign King decided to create the human body to discipline the Souls.

Hermes continued, "The Sovereign called me and said, 'Soul of My Soul and Mind of My Mind, how long shall the things below remain in darkness and without praise? Bring all the Gods in Heaven to Me.' When they arrived, He said, 'Look down upon the Earth.' They looked and understood His will. When He spoke to them about humanity, they agreed to give their best.

The Sun said, 'I'll shine fully.' The Moon promised to provide light after the Sun and said she had already given birth to Fear, Silence, Sleep, and Memory, which would be very useful. 

Cronus said he was the father of Justice and Necessity. Zeus said, 'So that humans don't always fight, I have created Fortune, Hope, and Peace.' Ares declared he was the father of Struggle, Wrath, and Strife."

---Aphrodite did not hesitate and said, "I will add Desire, Joy, and Laughter to them, so that our kindred souls, while enduring their harsh punishment, may not suffer completely." Everyone was pleased with Aphrodite's words. Hermes then said, "I will give men a good nature. I will endow them with Prudence, Wisdom, Persuasiveness, and Truth, and I will always collaborate with Invention to benefit human life. The types of life our Father and Creator assigned to me are those of wisdom and intelligence, especially when the motion of the Stars aligns naturally with each type."

God, the Master of the universe, was happy to hear this and commanded that the human race should exist. Hermes continued, "I was searching for the materials needed and asked the Monarch for help. He instructed the Souls to provide the remaining mixture, and it was completely dried up. So, I added more water than needed to restore it to its original state, making the substance flexible, weak, and powerless to prevent it from being overly powerful in addition to its natural intelligence.

"I shaped it, and it was beautiful. I was delighted with my creation and called upon the Monarch to see it. He looked upon it, was pleased, and ordered the Souls to take on flesh. The Souls were then plunged into deep darkness, and upon realizing their condemnation, they began to wail. I was amazed at their reactions."Listen carefully, son Horus, for you are about to learn the Mystic Spectacle that our ancestor Kamephis was privileged to hear from Hermes, the recorder of all deeds. I heard it from Kamephis, the oldest among us, when he honored me with the Black Rite that grants perfection. Now, hear it from me!

When people were about to be confined, some simply wailed and groaned, much like animals that, once free, become poor slaves and resist when taken from their familiar surroundings. They fight and revolt against their masters and, if given the chance, might even kill those who oppress them.

Others hissed like snakes with louder cries; one shrieked and wept before speaking. Moving his eyes around, he said:

"O Heaven, source of our creation, O Aether, Air, O Hands and holy Breath of God our King, O brilliant Stars, eyes of the Gods, O tireless light of Sun and Moon, co-creators of our being, separated from you all, we suffer deeply. 

This is even worse because we are being taken from the vast realms of light, from your holy presence and our shared rule with the Gods, to these lowly and dishonorable places. 

What unseemly act have we committed to deserve such punishment? What crimes have we committed to earn these penalties? How many sins await us, poor souls? How many tasks must we accomplish in this hopeless state to sustain these fragile bodies that will soon dissolve?"We will no longer see the souls of God. When we view our forefather, Heaven, through such watery eyes, he appears small and insignificant, and we will be filled with sorrow. Sometimes, we won't see at all because we have been judged and not granted the gift of true sight. Our eyes are like windows, not truly seeing.

How miserable it will be to hear our kindred breathing while we can no longer breathe with them! Instead of this vast world, only a small heart awaits us. Free us from these lowly bonds and end our suffering, O Lord, Father, and Creator. If you have become indifferent to your creation, set some limits for us. Please still consider us worthy of even a few words while we can still see the light of the world.

Horus, the son, spoke, and the souls' request was granted. The Monarch came, sat on the Throne of Truth, and responded to their prayers.

"O Souls, Love and Necessity shall be your rulers, after Me. Know that as long as you remain free from sin, you will dwell in Heaven. But if you are blamed for something, you will be sent to mortal bodies. If your faults are minor, you will leave your mortal bodies and return to Heaven without sorrow. But if you commit greater sins, and your bodies don't advance, you won't live in Heaven or human bodies. Instead, you will wander in irrational lives."Thus speaking, Horus, He granted everyone the gift of breath and continued:

"I haven't set the rules for your transformations without purpose or by chance. If you act improperly, things will get worse for you; if you act nobly, things will improve, reflecting your true nature. I alone will be the Observer and Judge. Understand that your current situation—being trapped in bodies—is a punishment for past actions.

"Your future transformations will vary, as I have described, with different bodies. The final dissolution of these bodies will be a blessing and a return to the happiness of earlier times. However, if you act in ways unworthy of Me, your mind will be clouded, mistaking punishment for benefit and seeing a worse state as an improvement.

"For the more righteous among you, who are on the verge of a divine change, you will become righteous kings, true philosophers, founders of states, lawmakers, genuine seers, true herbalists, prophets of the best Gods, skilled musicians, knowledgeable astronomers, wise soothsayers, and expert sacrificers—those of you who are deserving of all that is good and fair.

Among birds, you will be eagles, who neither scare away nor harm their kind. In fact, when eagles are around, no weaker creature will be allowed to suffer harm, as eagles are naturally just. Among four-legged animals, you will be lions, embodying strength and a life that requires little sleep, practicing immortal virtues in mortal bodies—never growing tired or needing rest."In modern English, the text could be simplified and corrected as follows:

---

"And among the creeping things, there will be dragons. These creatures will be very strong, live for a long time, cause no harm, and in a way, be friendly towards humans. They can be tamed, will have no poison, and will shed their skin, much like the gods.

Among the swimming creatures, there will be dolphins. Dolphins will take pity on those who fall into the sea. If the person is still alive, they will carry them to land; if the person is dead, they will not touch them, even though dolphins are the most voracious creatures in the water."

Thus speaking, God became an immortal Mind. Then, son Horus, from the Earth arose a very Mighty Spirit, whose strength was in his intellect and not confined by any physical form. Although he already knew what he was asking about—the human body, which was fair and dignified but also very savage and full of fear—he cried out as soon as he saw the souls entering the bodies:

"What are these called, O Hermes, Recorder of the Gods?" And when Hermes answered "Men," the Spirit said, "Hermes, it is a bold creation, making man with curious eyes, talkative tongues, the ability to hear things that don't concern him, a keen sense of smell, and the desire to touch everything.

"Have you, their creator, decided to leave them free from worry, even though they will daringly explore the greatest mysteries of Nature? Would you leave them without grief, even though in the future they will seek to understand mysteries beyond the Earth?

"Men will dig up the roots of plants and discover their properties. Men will study the nature of stones. Men will dissect not only animals but also themselves, seeking to understand how they were made."They will boldly reach out to the sea, cut down natural forests, and help each other travel to distant lands. People will even explore the sacred places that no one has previously stepped foot in, and they will strive to understand the movement of the heavens. These achievements are moderate compared to what they will do next. They will venture to the farthest limits of the Earth, and in their daring, they will explore the deepest darkness of the night.

Nothing will stop them from gaining freedom from pain and living a carefree life without fear. Will they not then aim for the heights of Heaven? Will they not, with souls free from worry, reach out to the fundamental elements of existence? Teach them to plan things that come with risks, so they may learn from the pain of failure.

Let their restless nature be tempered by desires, fears, griefs, and false hopes. Let them be swayed by love, hopes, and many desires, sometimes fulfilled and sometimes not, so that the sweetness of success draws them into struggles and greater challenges. Let illness weigh on them so that they may learn to control their desires through discipline.

Are you saddened, Horus, to hear your mother speak these words? Are you not amazed and terrified at how much suffering humans endure? Listen to something even sadder! When Momos spoke these words, Hermes was pleased because he knew they were spoken out of love. Thus, he followed the advice, saying:

"Momos, the Divine Breath that surrounds all things will not become inactive."The Master of the universe appointed me as steward and manager. "Therefore, the overseer of His command will be the keen-eyed Goddess Adrasteia. I will skillfully create a powerful instrument, one that sees everything without error and cannot be escaped. This instrument will govern everything on earth from birth to death, linking all actions. It will rule all things on Earth, including humans." 

These words, said Hermes, were spoken to Momos, and immediately the instrument was set in motion. When this was done, and the souls had entered their bodies, Hermes was praised for his work. The Monarch then called the Gods together again. The Gods assembled, and He made another proclamation:

"Gods, you who are of the highest nature and free from decay, who are appointed to forever order the mighty Aeon, through whom all universal things endlessly interact—how long shall we rule this unknown sovereignty? How long will these things surpass the power of the Sun and Moon's sight? Let each of us contribute according to our abilities. Let us use our energy to transform this inert state; let chaos seem like an unbelievable myth to future generations. Let us begin great work, and I will start first."

He spoke, and immediately the cosmic order began to differentiate from the previous black unity. The heavens shone with all their mysteries, and Earth, still trembling, hardened as the Sun shone, revealing its beauty. Even things that humans consider insignificant are beautiful to God, as they serve His laws.God rejoiced when He saw His creations in motion. Holding as much as the entire surrounding space in His hands, He said:

"Take these, holy Earth, you who are to be the mother of all things, and may you never lack anything!"

God spoke and, opening His hands, He poured all His creations into the world. Initially, these souls were unknown and felt imprisoned. Unhappy with their confinement, they began to compete with the Gods in Heaven, asserting their noble origins. When they were restrained, they rebelled by using weaker humans to fight among themselves, causing chaos and conflict. The strong oppressed the weak, committing atrocities and desecrating holy places. In their distress, the elements decided to go to God and complain about the savage state of human life. 

Fire, the first to speak, said:

"O Lord, Creator of this new World, mysterious Name among the Gods, and revered by all humanity, how long will you leave mortal life without divine guidance? Show Yourself to Your world, bring peace to this savagery, give laws to life, provide oracles for justice, fill everything with hope, and let men fear the Gods' vengeance so that none will sin."If people receive appropriate punishment for their sins, they will stop doing wrong, respect their oaths, and avoid sacrilege. Teach them to be grateful for the good they receive, so that I, the Fire, can joyfully participate in sacrificial rites and send pleasant aromas from the altar.

Right now, I am polluted, Lord. Because of these godless men, I am forced to burn flesh. They misuse me for purposes other than what I was created for, corrupting my pure state.

Air also said:

"I too, Lord, am polluted by the vapors from dead bodies. I have become unhealthy and am forced to witness things I should not."

Next, Water spoke:

"O Father, O Creator of all things, marvelous Daimon, and Maker of Nature, who enables all things to exist, please command that rivers and seas remain pure. They are being polluted by washing the hands of murderers and receiving the bodies of the murdered."

Then Earth, in deep sorrow, spoke:

"O Lord, Chief of the Heavenly Ones, and Master of the Elements, from whom all things begin and end according to Necessity's decree, the wicked dance upon my surface. I embrace all of nature as you commanded, bearing and receiving all things, even when they are killed. But now, I am dishonored. The world, though filled with all else, lacks a God."Because they have nothing to fear, they sin in everything, and from my heights, O Lord, they fall dead through every evil action. Their decaying bodies corrupt me. So, I am forced, Lord, to hold within me those who are worthless. Despite all I bear, I wish to hold God too. "Bestow upon Earth, if not Yourself, then some holy essence of You. Make the Earth more honored than the other elements. It is only right that she should boast of gifts from You, as she gives everything." Thus spoke the Elements, and God, fulfilling all things with His holy voice, said:

"Depart, Holy Ones, worthy children of a mighty Father, and do not attempt to innovate or leave My World without your active service. For now, another part of My Nature is among you, and he will be a pious supervisor of all deeds, an incorruptible judge of living men and an absolute ruler of those beneath the earth. He will not only strike terror into them but also take vengeance on them. Every man will face the fate he deserves according to his birth." And so the Elements ceased their complaints,

at the Master's order, and they held their peace. Each of them continued in their authority and rule. And then Horus said:

How did Earth receive God's essence, mother? And Isis replied:

I cannot tell the story of this birth; it is not permitted to describe the origin of your descent, O Horus, son of mighty power, lest the way of birth of the immortal Gods become known to men. Except to say that God the Monarch, the universal Orderer and Architect, sent your mighty father Osiris and the great Goddess Isis for a short time to help the world, for all things needed them. They filled life with life.They are the ones who ended the brutal violence of men killing each other. They consecrated areas for their gods and established places for holy rituals. They provided laws, food, and shelter to people. According to Hermes, they will learn the secrets of his writings, keep some for themselves, and carve those most beneficial to humans onto tablets and obelisks.

They were the first to create courts of law and filled the world with justice and fair governance. They introduced the concepts of promises and faith, and brought the powerful witness of an oath into human affairs. They taught people how to properly care for the deceased.

They investigated the mystery of death and discovered that while the departing spirit desires to return to its body, failure to do so results in death. Hermes taught them that the space around us is filled with spirits, and they inscribed this hidden knowledge on stones. Guided by Hermes in divine secrets, they became the founders of arts, sciences, and all human activities, and the creators of laws. Hermes taught them that earthly things are connected to the heavenly, leading them to establish sacred rites on earth that mirror heavenly mysteries.

Understanding the mortality of human bodies, they created the role of prophets, perfected in all ways, ensuring that no prophet who reached out to the gods would be ignorant. They also ensured that magic and philosophy would nourish the soul, and medicine would heal the body in times of pain.After we had done all this, my son, Osiris and I saw that the world was now full. We were then called back by those in Heaven, but we couldn't go up until we appealed to the Monarch to fill the surrounding space with this soul knowledge. Only then could we make our ascent acceptable to Him, for God delights in hymns.

"Yes, mother," Horus said. "Please teach me this hymn as well, so I won't remain ignorant."

And Isis said: "Listen, my son!"^96:3 The text uses masculine pronouns, even though the writer is supposed to be taking on the persona of Isis.

^97:1 The text here is extremely unclear. Meineke's suggestion that Hermes smeared the books with some magical ointment is creative but not convincing, although Wachsmuth agrees with it.

^97:2 This interpretation is purely speculative; the text is very corrupted.

^98:1 This refers to the concept of invention.

^98:2 This refers to breaths or spirits.

^98:3 The term "pur noeron" was frequently used later by Platonists; see Porphyry in Eusebius' "Preparation for the Gospel," Book XV, Chapter 11, Section 16.

^99:1 This refers to the knowing and unknowing primal elements. See P. S. A., VI.

^99:2 The text is complicated and unclear, and the writer's meaning is uncertain. "Psychosis" could mean either animation (bringing to life) or "making cold." The writer seems to think the name Psychosis is related to the term "epsyxe," which can mean "freeze" or "breathe." However, this reasoning is contradictory compared to the description of the soul's nature, especially considering Origen's theory that the soul (psyxe) was named because it grew cold and fell away from divine warmth and life. Compare this with the term "sumatusis" in Exx. VIII.5, VII.2.

^100:1 See Plato's "Timaeus," Section 41: "He divided the whole mixture into souls equal in number to the stars, and assigned each soul to a star." Philo also mentions souls being equal in number to the stars in "De Somniis," Book I, Section 22.

^100:2 See Plato, same reference.The souls were not as pure as they once were; they were diluted to second and third degrees. See section 56 below.

Regarding the Nature Above, often referred to as the "Jerusalem Above" by the Gnostics, compare with Plato's Timaeus (41 D): "After placing them among the stars, like in a chariot, he showed them the nature of the universe and explained the laws of destiny. According to these laws, their first birth would be the same for all, with no one suffering a disadvantage. They were to be placed in bodies suited to them, and emerge as the most religious of animals. Human nature being of two kinds, the superior race would later be called man." Also see section 12 below.

For further references, see P. S. A., xix, section 31 below, and Hermes-Prayer, iii. 3, with notes.

We previously mentioned fire (aether) and air, with psychosis being the quintessence. These likely represent the types of life in the upper world, symbolized by the zodiac.

Meineke, following Cantor, suggests a correction from the traditional "visible."

For additional references, see Cyril, C. J., i. 15 (Frag. xvi.), and Plato's Critias (108).

The term "signs of the zodiac" is used here. There is a gap in the text, which I've filled based on context.

The reading of one sentence remains uncorrected, so its translation is somewhat speculative. An Orphic verse has entered the text from the margin: "By light we see; by eyes we see nothing." See Fragm. Monad., x., p. 504, Herm.

For further references, compare with Plato's Meno (76) and Seneca's Natural Questions (iv. 9). Also see Timaeus (42 A): "When they are implanted in bodies by necessity, they will have sensation and love." See Frag. xxiii.If a person lived well during their lifetime, they would return and live happily on their native star. However, if they did not achieve this, they would be reborn as a woman. If, in that state, they continued to do evil, they would keep transforming into different animals that matched their acquired evil nature. This cycle would continue until they followed the path of reason and overcame their chaotic tendencies, eventually returning to their original, better state.

Note: The original text makes an implicit reference to the ancient belief that women were of inferior status, which is not included in this modernized version.When the Creator had established all these laws, He remained in His usual nature. Nemesis, the deity of karma, from whom no one can escape, according to the common understanding of her name. Supplicants consulting an oracle. Or disks, likely referring to world-wheels. Sacred outflow. Compare with Corpus Hermeticum, Book XIII (XIV), section 3 (Commentary). Mummification. Theoria, contemplative science, direct knowledge. The commentary begins at the end of the following excerpt. Thrice-Greatest Hermes, Vol. 3, by G.R.S. Mead, 1906, at sacred-texts.com

EXCERPT XXVI. THE VIRGIN OF THE WORLD [II.] (Patrizzi continues this text without interruption. Text sources include Stobaeus, Physics, Book 45, under the heading "In the Same"; G. pp. 420-427; M. i. 299-304; W. i. 407-414. Menard, Book III, No. II of "Fragment," etc., as above, pp. 201-208.)

Horus asked: "Mother of great honor, how are royal souls born?"

Isis replied: "Son Horus, the distinction of royal souls is somewhat like this. There are four regions in the universe governed by unbreakable laws: Heaven, Aether, Air, and the most holy Earth. Above in Heaven, the Gods dwell, ruled by the Architect of all. In the Aether, the Stars reside, governed by the mighty Sun. In the Air, only souls live, ruled by the Moon. On Earth, humans and other living beings dwell, ruled by whoever is king at the time.

The Gods create kings to rule over the beings on Earth."The rulers are extensions of the king, with those closer to him being more royal than others; just as the Sun, being closer to God than the Moon, is much larger and more powerful, with the Moon coming second in both rank and power. The king is the highest of all men but the lowest of the gods. As long as he is on Earth, he is separated from his true divinity but possesses qualities that set him apart from ordinary people, making him god-like. The soul sent to inhabit him comes from a higher place than the souls sent to other men. Souls are sent from this higher place to become rulers for two reasons.

First, those who have led noble and blameless lives and are about to become gods are born as kings. This allows them to practice using the power that gods possess. Second, some souls that are already gods but have slightly broken divine rules are also born as kings. This ensures they do not suffer a loss of dignity or nature when they are in human form. They retain their divine status even while bound in human bodies.

The differences in the dispositions of kings are not due to the nature of their souls, as all these souls are divine, but are influenced by the angels and daimons who accompany them. These special souls do not descend alone; they are guarded and escorted. Justice in the higher realms ensures that everyone receives their due, even if they are exiled from their heavenly home.When, my son, the angels and spirits who bring down the soul are warlike, the soul adopts their aggressive tendencies, forgetting its own nature and remembering the actions of the spirits. When they are peaceful, the soul also acts peacefully. When they love justice, the soul defends what is right. When they love music, the soul sings. When they love truth, the soul philosophizes. Souls naturally adopt the traits of those who bring them to the world, as they forget their true nature and remember more the traits of the powers that confine them to bodies.

"Mother, you have explained well," said Horus. "But you haven't told me how noble souls are born." 

"Just as there are different states on Earth, there are different origins for souls. Souls that come from a more glorious place have a nobler birth. Just as among humans, the free are considered more noble than the slaves, so it is with the nature of souls."

"And how are male and female souls produced?" asked Horus.

"Souls, my son, are of the same nature. They come from the same place where the Creator made them; they are neither male nor female. Sex is a characteristic of bodies, not souls. The difference in strength or delicacy among souls is due to the 'cosmic air' in which they are made. This 'air' is essentially the body that surrounds the soul, composed of earth, water, air, and fire."As women have more wet and cold elements, but less dry and warm ones, their souls become relaxed and delicate. In contrast, men have more dry and warm elements, and less cold and wet ones, making their souls sturdy and more active.

How do souls become intelligent, mother? Isis answered:

The eye is covered in layers. When these layers are thick, the eye is dim; when they are thin, the sight is sharp. The same goes for the soul. It has incorporeal layers, like it is itself incorporeal. These layers are the "airs" within us. When they are light, thin, and clear, the soul is intelligent. When they are dense, thick, and murky, the soul, like in bad weather, can only see things close by.

Horus asked:

Why are people outside our land not as wise as our compatriots? Isis replied:

The Earth lies in the middle of the universe, like a person lying on their back with eyes turned to the heavens, divided into regions like a human body. She looks to the sky, her father, to bring about changes. Her head is to the south, right shoulder to the southeast, left shoulder to the southwest; feet under the Bear constellation, right foot under its tail, left under its head; thighs under the stars following the Bear; waist under the central stars.

A sign of this is that people in the south, living on her head, have fine heads and good hair. Those in the east are ready for battle and skilled archers, fitting for the right hand.People in the west are more stable and often use their left hand for tasks that others typically do with their right hand. Those living in the northern regions, under the constellation known as the Bear, are known for their strong feet and legs. Moving a bit further south, towards areas like modern-day Italy and Greece, people have well-proportioned thighs and backs. Additionally, these northern regions, being generally whiter, produce people with lighter skin. 

Since the most sacred land of our ancestors lies at the center of the Earth, and the center of the human body houses the heart—the source of the soul—the people from this central region not only possess all the qualities of others but are also especially intelligent and wise, having been born and raised in this heartland.

Moreover, my son, the south receives clouds that gather from the atmosphere, explaining why our river originates from there, breaking up the frost. Whenever a cloud descends, it creates mist and fog, which obstructs both sight and thought. The east, constantly heated by the rising sun, and the west, heated by the setting sun, do not provide clear conditions for observation. The cold from the north also freezes both bodies and minds. In contrast, the central region remains pure and undisturbed, allowing it to foresee events for itself and everyone within it.Free from trouble, it produces, adorns, and educates, using only these tools to fight and win, skillfully bestowing the fruits of victory upon the defeated, just like a good ruler.

"Explain this too, mother," he asked. "Why is it that when people suffer from long-term illnesses, their rational part—their reason and soul—sometimes becomes impaired?" And Isis replied:

"Living things, my son, have different affinities: some with fire, some with water, some with air, some with earth, and some with combinations of these elements. Conversely, some are enemies of fire, water, air, or earth, and some dislike combinations of them. For example, locusts and flies avoid fire; eagles, hawks, and high-flying birds avoid water; fish avoid air and earth; and snakes avoid open air. On the other hand, snakes and creeping things love the earth, swimming creatures love water, winged beings love the air, and those that soar higher are drawn to fire. Some animals even love fire, like salamanders that make their homes in it. This is because one or another of the elements forms their bodies' outer layer.

Each soul, while in its body, is influenced and constrained by these four elements. Naturally, it finds some of them pleasing and others painful. For this reason, it doesn't achieve its full potential. Yet, because it is divine by nature, even when confined in a body, it strives and thinks, although not as freely as it would if it were free from bodily constraints."If these bodies are affected by storms, stress, disease, or fear, the soul itself is thrown into turmoil, much like a person at sea without anything stable beneath them.

COMMENTARY

ARGUMENT

1. "The Virgin of the World" is a sacred initiation sermon into the teachings of Hermes. It represents the first stage of initiation, where wisdom is passed from the teacher to the student orally. The instructor, representing Isis-Sophia, speaks on her behalf, offering her beloved son, the newly born Horus, the first taste of immortality. This helps to cleanse him of the poison of forgetfulness and ignorance, and raises him from a state of death. This process shows that the divine order is perfect, with each level of existence being a mystery to those below it.No mortal mind can fully understand this order. Even in the distant past, when there were no humans but only immortal Gods—the first creation of the World-creator—even these Gods were amazed at the splendor and beauty of the greater mysteries that adorned Heaven. These Gods did not yet know God. They were immortal but unknowing, intoxicated by the beauty of Heaven, and awestruck by its mysteries. Then, the Father of all poured the Splendor of His Mind into their hearts, and they began to understand.

This story is mixed with a mythical historical tradition that suggests all this occurred on an "earth" where humanity had not yet appeared, in a distant past when the earth was different—a Golden Age with only Gods and no humans. In that race of Gods, those with a divine flame, rather than a mere spark, were the teachers of heavenly wisdom. Hermes was one of these—a race or "being" rather than an individual. These "Sons of Fire" left their wisdom recorded in symbols on "stone," entrusted to others of the same race but less knowledgeable, and then ascended to Heaven.

Their successors did not have such a bright flame in their hearts. They were of the same race but younger souls—the Tat-race. Hermes could not pass on the direct knowledge to them, the "perfect sight" (theuria), so he encoded the wisdom in symbols and myths. Later on, the Asclepius-race joined with the Tat-souls.This all took place many ages ago, long before the times of the god-men Osiris and Isis. The true wisdom of Hermes was so ancient that even Isis had to search for hidden records using her inner vision once she gained the power to see, and when the True Sun illuminated her mind.

However, the task of reconstructing this distant past is overwhelming for the writer. He knows he is dealing with "myths" and what Plutarch would call the "doings of the daimones." He understands that these ancient "Books" of Hermes likely no longer exist physically, if they ever did. Regardless of the legends told or the beliefs of the priesthood about ancient physical inscriptions of Hermes, this wisdom has vanished. The true wisdom of Hermes is engraved on the tablets of the aether and not hidden on Earth. The "Books" are inscribed with the "sacred symbols of the cosmic elements" and are hidden near the "secrets of Osiris"—the mysteries of creative fire and the light that speaks to the heart. The real Books of Hermes are stored in their own realms, the pure elements of the unseen world—the celestial Egypt.

This wisdom was preserved for the "souls" of men; it was spiritual knowledge, not physical. The writer then recounts the tradition of the creation of the "souls" of men in their pure state, all derived from the "Books of Hermes." The story of soul-creation is as follows:

The Watchers approach the Creator. The time has come for a new Cosmic Dawn, for a new Day. Cosmos is to awaken after the Night. The Creative Mind of the universe focuses on a new phase, a new world-period.God smiled, and His laughter resonated through space. With His Word, He brought forth a new dawn from the primal darkness of the new universe. His first creation, a transcendental or intelligible Nature, appeared before Him in all its new beauty. This was the primal fullness of the new universe, the ideal cosmos of our world, among many others, as the Gods marveled at the mystery.

Immediately, this Nature divided into three parts: herself, Toil, and their beautiful child Invention, to whom God granted the gift of being, producing only ideal forms. The first creation involved bringing forth potentials, types, and ideas, all given the gift of being. This was the world "above," the primal Heaven, in ultimate perfection, forming the unchanging boundaries of the new universe. These entities were filled with "mysteries," not "breaths" or "lives," as these had not yet come into being.

The next stage involved breathing the spiritual breath of life into the fairest blend of the primal elements that make up the world. This blend, or soul-substance, is called psychosis. The primal elements were not our mixed earth, water, fire, and air, but "knowing fire" (perhaps "intelligible fire" or the "flower of fire" from the "Chaldean Oracles") and unknowing air. Heaven or the ideal world was filled with all things, including air and aether (possibly fire), while earth-water had not yet manifested, much less earth and water. These souls, corresponding to the later human stage, were a blend of three elements: spirit, knowing fire, and unknowing air—triads forming a unity called psychosis.All souls were fundamentally equal but varied according to a fixed numbering system. They seemed to be a definite number, possibly one soul for each star, as Plato suggested, following a law of similarity between greater and lesser, inner and outer realms.

These souls were "sacred men," created before the "sacred animals." They resided in Upper Nature, the most beautiful part of the aether—the celestial cosmos. They were assigned specific roles and responsibilities to keep the "wheel revolving," meaning they were to shape forms for birth and death, facilitating the continuous flow of life within the great sphere. This was their duty, imposed by the Great King, their creator. As long as they maintained their roles, they would live forever in bliss and beauty, contemplating the wonders of the universe amid the stars. However, disobedience would bring bonds and punishment.

Next, there is another creation of souls, which is somewhat harder to understand. These souls are of a lower rank than the previous ones, composed of primal water and earth, not the compound elements we know today. These are the souls of certain "sacred animals" or lives, which relate to the souls that "keep the wheel revolving" as animals do to humans on earth. They do not resemble earthly animals or have typical animal forms but have human-like forms, though they are not humans.The divine "water-earth" substance wasn't yet exhausted, so the remaining part was given to "the souls that had gone ahead and were called to the land of the Gods." These souls, close to the Gods in the highest heaven, are the proper human souls. From this leftover material, the Builders were instructed to create animals based on the Creator's models—different types of life below the human level, arranged according to the "movements of the souls." This means there were different classes of Builders for each type of animal they were to imitate. The Builders would shape the forms, and the Creator would breathe life into them.

Thus, the Builders created the etheric doubles of birds, quadrupeds, fish, and reptiles, not their physical bodies, as the earth was not yet solid. The Builder-souls completed their task and made the original models of the celestial types of animals. Proud of their work, they became restless under the restrictions of their stations and exceeded the limits set by the Creator.

As a result, the Creator decided to make the human body to imprison the disobedient souls. Here, we learn that all this psychogenesis was directly taught to the writer by Hermes—not a physical Hermes, but the Hermes whose "Books" are hidden in the zones, whom the writer claims to have encountered face-to-face after his inner vision was opened, allowing him to see "the mysteries of that new dawn."For the creation of the human form, the seven obedient Gods, to whom human souls are related, are summoned by their leader, Hermes. Hermes is the beloved son and messenger of the Supreme, referred to as the "soul of My Soul, and holy mind of My own Mind."

All seven Gods promise to give their best to humanity. The material used to create the human form is the leftover mixture from which the Builders had already made animal forms. However, Hermes himself, the Builder of human forms, mixed this material with more water.

The writer adds that this information comes not from a vision of Hermes but from an initiation called the "Black Rite," led by Kamephis, known as the "earliest of all" or "most ancient among us." Kamephis represents an older wisdom than that of Isis, yet even he passes on Hermes's tradition.

The souls are given bodies and express loud complaints. Initially, not all souls can speak clearly; most can only groan, scream, or hiss. However, the leading class of souls can control their bodies enough to speak clearly, and one of them makes a desperate appeal to Heaven. They have lost their celestial state and can no longer see "without the light." They are confined to a "heart's small compass," with the Sun of their being now just a light-spark hidden in the heart, representing the logos, the inner reality in humans. The souls pray for better conditions, and the moral law's principles are explained to them.Those who do good deeds will, upon their death, ascend to Heaven and find peace; those who do evil will undergo redemption through reincarnation, moving from one body to another, from one confinement to another. Details of this reincarnation process are provided, especially for the "more righteous," who will become kings, philosophers, and prophets. These souls, it seems, although not explicitly stated, will experience some form of life with the leading types of animals—eagles, lions, dragons, and dolphins—when they are not incarnated in a human body. If this interpretation is incorrect, such souls will still have a close connection with the noblest forms of animal essence. 

Then appears the mighty Intellect of the Earth, known as Erdgeist, in the form of Momus. Speaking out of affection for Hermes, Momus urges him to increase the challenges and trials for human souls so that they do not become too daring. Consequently, Hermes activates the mechanism of unerring fate and mechanical retribution.

All these events occurred at the dawn of earthly life, when the earth was still in a primitive, less solid state. At that time, our current phase of existence had not yet emerged; the earth was still trembling and had not yet hardened. This means that the essence of humanity was in an etheric state. Gradually, the earth solidified. Into this now more solid earth, the Creator and his obedient gods, who had not rebelled, bestowed the blessings of nature.The beautiful symbol of hands giving blessings is depicted in Egypt as sun-rays ending in hands, providing light and life.

The imprisoned souls, who are kin to the gods and obedient, continue to rebel. They become leaders of humanity, which is much weaker than they are and still in its early stages of development. Instead of teaching love and wisdom, these rebellious souls exploit humans for evil purposes, such as war and conflict, oppression, and savagery. Things worsen, and the earth is tainted with the horrors brought by savage humans. In despair, the pure elements plead to God, asking Him to send a holy emanation to restore order.

God then sends a divine being, an avatara, as the Aryan Hindu tradition would call it, a dual manifestation. Osiris and Isis are born to aid the world, guiding humanity away from savagery and restoring moral order. Hermes directly instructs them in law, science, and wisdom. Their mission is successful, and the world learns about the Path of Return. Before ascending to Heaven, Osiris and Isis request that not only earth but also the spaces up to Heaven be filled with the knowledge of the truth. They then praise the Supreme Father and Monarch of all, but unfortunately, Stobaeus did not copy their hymn. The original "Virgin of the World" text is interrupted only by the missing Hymn of Osiris and Isis, and the narrative continues seamlessly. The subject is the birth of royal souls, building on previous teachings.There are four main realms:

1. Invisible Heaven, home to the Gods, with the Invisible Sun as the supreme ruler.
2. Aether, where the Stars reside, with the Sun as their leader for us.
3. Air, inhabited by non-physical souls, overseen by the Moon, which guides the paths of birth.
4. Earth, where humans and animals live, with humans ruled by the Divine King of the time.

The king-soul is the lowest of the Gods but the highest of humans; however, on Earth, he is only a demigod because his true divinity is hidden. His soul, or "ka," originates from a higher plane than that of other humans. Typically, ascending human souls evolve by moving through cycles of reincarnation, becoming more virtuous and knowledgeable. At their peak, before descending back into rebirth, they approach the boundaries of the physical world and the edge of Heaven.

There is also a special group of descending royal souls who have sinned less and therefore descend only to the level of humanity. The royal soul isn't just a warrior king; he can also be a just judge, a musician, a poet, a truth-seeker, or a philosopher. Unlike lower souls, whose actions are driven by animalistic traits, these royal souls are guided by a nobler order, accompanied by angels and daimones at birth.

Unfortunately, the details of their birth are lost, either because Stobaeus hesitated to reveal them or they were removed by a later scribe.We are next told that sex is not an essential trait of the soul. It is an attribute of the body, but this body is not the physical one; it is an "airy" body. This air is not a simple element but is already divided into four sub-elements.

Moreover, the soul's vision or intelligence depends on the purity of certain layers called "airs," which seem to be even more subtle than the airy body.

The text then provides a simple reason for the excellence of Egypt and the wisdom of the Egyptians. Here, the writer appears to move away from the direct influence of the Trismegistic tradition and includes popular beliefs. The remaining sections of the excerpt deal with speculations on the cause of delirium, and Stobaeus concludes the extract without allowing the writer to finish his explanation.

As for the title, which has commonly been translated as "The Virgin of the World," a discussion on its meaning will be more appropriate later on. We have no external means of determining how much of the original treatise Stobaeus has passed on to us. However, our two extracts clearly connect with each other, and the original text is only interrupted by the unfortunate omission of the Hymn of Osiris and Isis. The first extract is evidently not the beginning of the treatise, as it starts with references to previous content, while the second extract ends unsatisfactorily in the middle of a subject. Despite these gaps, what we do have provides interesting insights into how the writer viewed his sources, whether written or oral, physical or psychic.He wants us to see his work as a unified piece of literature. The subject is so well-constructed that it’s hard to figure out the sources the writer might have used. The story flows smoothly with a consistent style, even though some parts contradict each other about where the information comes from. Reitzenstein, however, argues that the creation story shows clear traces of two older versions and that this isn’t surprising because there are two (or more precisely four) different introductions. We don’t fully agree with him. While these introductory statements seem contradictory at first, they are not actually self-contradictory upon closer inspection.

### THE DIRECT VOICE AND THE BOOKS OF HERMES

The main idea is that Hermes, who witnessed the creation of the world and the formation of souls, taught Isis. Isis gained her knowledge either from the sacred Books of Hermes or through the Master’s direct spiritual voice. This implies that her knowledge came from direct revelation since the Books are not physical. These Books have disappeared and can only be accessed by reaching the spiritual zones where they are hidden. These zones are the same as the soul-spaces mentioned in other texts.

There is also another tradition, which starts with mythological and psychic elements, even though later details seem to be historical and physical. According to this tradition, when the first and most ancient Hermes ascended to Heaven, he left his Books with the Gods in these zones, rather than on earth.On earth, a younger generation, loved by Hermes and represented as his son Tat, followed this wisdom. These were souls too young to fully grasp true science. They were seen as the Tat (Thoth) priesthood of humanity and were later joined by wisdom-seekers from another tradition, the Imuth (Asclepius) brotherhood, whose teachings originally came from Ptah. This suggests an ancient union of two mystic science traditions, possibly from the Memphitic and Thebaic priesthoods.

The writer claims to present a higher and more direct teaching than the established traditions of the Isiac mystery-cult or the Tat-Asclepius school. He does this through Isis, who learns directly from the ancient Hermes. This indicates that in the Hermes circles of the Theoretics (those with direct insight), the Isis mystery-teaching, while part of the wisdom tradition, was considered secondary to the direct illumination.

KAMEPHIS AND THE DARK MYSTERY

Contradicting this, we have the following statement: "Pay close attention, son Horus, for you are being told the mystic spectacle that Kamephis, our forefather, was privileged to hear from Hermes, the record-keeper of all deeds, and I from Kamephis when he honored me with the Black Rite that brings perfection."

Reitzenstein (p. 137) claims this merges two distinct traditions: (i) Kamephis, a later god and student of Hermes, and (ii) Kamephis, an older god and teacher of Isis. However, I disagree. It all hinges on the translation of the phrase para tou pantun progenesteroy, which Reitzenstein interprets as "the most ancient of all [gods]," but I translate as "the most ancient of [us] all."In essence, the general tradition of Isis states that Kamephis founded its mysteries. However, the Isis-Hermes circles claim that although Kamephis is indeed the most ancient figure in the Isis tradition, he was a student of the even older Hermes. In the mystery cult, Kamephis was likely represented by the chief priest who oversaw the "Dark Mystery" or "Black Rite," a ceremony performed only for those deemed worthy after extensive trials in lower degrees. This rite was considered far more sacred than the public mysteries. 

I suggest that this refers to the most secretive aspects of the Isiac tradition, which we'll explore further later. For now, it's enough to link it to certain objects or displays that appeared in the dark. As Clement of Alexandria mentions in his book, Stromateis:

"In the Greek mysteries, purification rites come first, similar to ablutions among non-Greeks. These are followed by the lesser mysteries, which offer some instruction and preparation for what’s to come. Finally, the great mysteries reveal the universe and allow contemplation and understanding of nature and the mystical things shown to the initiated."

But who was Kamephis in Egyptian theology? According to Reitzenstein, Kamephis or Kmephis (Kmeph) is identified by Egyptologists with Kneph, who, according to Plutarch, was worshipped in Thebes as the uncreated and immortal God.Kneph, as Sethe has shown, is one of the names of Ammon, who is described as the "husband of his mother" and the "creator who created himself." Kneph is also considered the Good Daimon, according to Philo of Byblus. He is identified as the Sun-god and Heaven-god Ammon. "When he opens his eyes, he fills the world with light in his primordial land; and when he closes them, everything is dark."

Kneph-Ammon is seen as the source of light in darkness and the one who opens the eyes. Additionally, Porphyry tells us that the Egyptians viewed Kneph as the creator and depicted him as a man with blue-black skin, wearing a belt, holding a scepter, and crowned with regal wings. This, Porphyry explains, symbolizes that Kneph represents the Logos or Reason, which is hard to find and hidden; he gives both light and life and is the King. The winged crown indicates his intellectual activity.

Kamephis, in the Isis tradition, represents Agathodaimon, the Logos-creator. He is a later figure in this role, having inherited it from Hermes, or at least learned the Logos-wisdom from Hermes.

Regarding this, it is useful to look at the account given by Syncellus, who took his information from Manetho. Manetho, according to Syncellus, stated in his books that he based his answers about the Egyptian dynasties to King Ptolemy on the monuments.Manetho tells us that these monuments were originally inscribed in a sacred language and writing by Thoth, the First Hermes. After a flood, they were translated into the common language of that time but still written in hieroglyphics. These translations were stored in books by the Second Hermes, the son of the Good Daimon and father of Tat, within the inner sanctuaries of Egyptian temples.

This tradition, dating back to Manetho, shouldn't be dismissed lightly, as I have discussed in Chapter V of the "Prolegomena" on "Manetho, High Priest of Egypt." It specifically addresses the Books of Hermes. While this tradition differs from the account in our Sermon (3-5) where the writer implies that the ancient records of Hermes were hidden magically and removed from the earth over time, Manetho’s account offers another perspective. 

According to Manetho, the oldest records were on stone monuments that survived a great flood in Egypt. These records were from the era of the First Hermes, associated with the earliest antediluvian Egyptian civilization. After the flood, the records were translated into ancient Egyptian and preserved in books by the Second Hermes, representing the priesthood of the ancient civilization after the flood, followed later by the Tat priesthood.The Isis tradition contradicts another tradition by placing Isis at the very beginning, even before Hermes I. This need not concern us, as each tradition claims its founders as the earliest, and we are currently focused on the claims of the Hermes school.

The key point is that there was a tradition explaining the past through successive periods of culture, with the oldest considered the wisest and most advanced. The archaic hieroglyphic language, which the priests of Manetho's time may not have fully understood, was believed to be the language of the civilization before Hermes I's Flood. It's possible that remnants of this language were preserved only in sacred magical invocations, considered the "language of the gods." According to the writer's circle, the records of this ancient civilization could no longer be read from the oldest inscriptions; they could only be accessed through spiritual insight. This relates to the statement in section 37 that Osiris and Isis, who had learned all the secrets from Hermes, kept part of them hidden and only inscribed what could be understood by "mortal men." Kamephis in the Isis tradition stands for Kneph as Agathodaimon, or Hermes, but not Hermes I. Rather, he represents Hermes II, who was taught by Hermes I.

But what exactly is the "black rite" that Kamephis oversees?I have already suggested the context in which the general meaning might be found, although I couldn't provide any concrete evidence. However, Reitzenstein believes he has found that evidence. His view is as follows:

The key to the meaning, according to him, is found in this line from a Magic Papyrus:

"I invoke you, Lady Isis, with whom the Good Daimon unites, He who is Lord in the perfect black land." Reitzenstein thinks that the Good Daimon here represents Chnum. He elaborates a detailed theory that the "black" refers to a specific region of fertile black earth between Syene and Takompso, famous for its pottery. This area, originally owned by the Isis priesthood, was later given to the priesthood of Chnum by King Djoser. Reitzenstein would translate the latter part of the sentence as "the Good Daimon who is Lord in the perfect black country," referring to Chnum, although he seems to recognize that this doesn't fully explain the word "perfect."

However, this interpretation seems to strip both our text and the Magic Papyrus of their deeper meaning, introducing irrelevant local geography. It makes more sense to interpret the Agathodaimon in the Papyrus as referring to Osiris, as this is one of his common titles. Moreover, Osiris is strongly associated with the "underworld," the unseen world, the "mysterious dark." He is the ruler there, while Isis remains on earth. Osiris would be the most appropriate figure to provide guidance on these matters, and indeed, one of the ancient mystery sayings was, "Osiris is a dark God."The phrase "He who is Lord in the perfecting black" might mean that Osiris, the male force of the soul, purified and perfected the man in the mysterious dark aspects of life, completing the work that Isis, the female force of the soul, had started. In the highest mystery circles, this could represent a stage of union between the man and his higher self, as suggested by Reitzenstein's citations from later Alchemical Hermes literature (pp. 142-144). This clearly relates to the mystical "sacred marriage," the intimate union of the soul with the divine logos or ray. While much could be said on this topic, two particularly interesting passages will suffice. The Jewish editor of the Naassene Document argues that the main mystery of Gnosis was the culmination of teachings from various mystery schools of different nations.

[p. 157]

The Lesser Mysteries, he says, involved "fleshly generation," while the Greater Mysteries dealt with new birth or regeneration, not physical birth. He describes a certain mystery, saying:

"For this is the Gate of Heaven, and this is the House of God, where the Good God dwells alone. No impure person can enter this House; it is reserved for the spiritual alone. When they enter, they must shed their garments and become bridegrooms, achieving their true manhood through the Virginal Spirit. Such a man is like a Virgin who is pregnant, conceiving and giving birth to a Son who is not psychic or fleshly, but a blessed Aeon of Aeons."In the newly discovered fragments of The Acts of John, found in a fourteenth-century manuscript in Vienna, there is a hymn that hints at early traditions, specifically suggesting the "sacred marriage" as a key element of the ritual. This can be compared to the "casting away of their garments" seen in other early texts. For example:

"[The Disciple.] I want to flee. [The Master.] I want you to stay. [The Assistants.] Amen! [The Disciple.] I want to be clothed. [The Master.] And I will clothe you. [The Assistants.] Amen! [The Disciple.] I want to be united. [The Master.] And I will unite you. [The Assistants.] Amen!"

BLACK LAND. Returning to the "mysterious black," Plutarch explains: "The Egyptians call Egypt 'Chemia' because its soil is particularly black, like the black of the eye, and they compare it to the heart." He further notes that Egypt is hot and moist and located in the southern part of the inhabitable world, similar to the heart's position on the left side of the human body.

Egypt, known as the "sacred land," was called Chemia or Chem (Hem), meaning Black-land, due to its dark, fertile soil. Symbolically, it was likened to the black pupil of the eye, with the stars and planets viewed as the eyes of the gods. Thus, Egypt was considered the eye and heart of the Earth. The Heavenly Nile was believed to pour wisdom into this "eye" or make the land pulse with celestial life. Plutarch's statement is supported by an ancient text from Edfu that says: "Egypt (literally the Black) is named after the eye of Osiris, for it is his pupil."Ammon-Kneph, as we have seen, is depicted as black or blue-black, signifying his hidden and mysterious nature. In the quoted passage, he is called "he who hides himself in his eye" or "he who veils himself in his pupil." This pupil, Reitzenstein concludes, is the "mysterious black." Could this be the origin of this phrase? If so, it would be linked to spiritual sight or true insight.

Isis is also associated with the black earth and thus the pupil of Osiris's eye, and by extension, the pupil of the eye of Chnum or Ammon, identified with Osiris at Syene. Therefore, Isis herself is the "Pupil of the World's Eye" or the kore kosmoy.

Reitzenstein suggests that the original type of our text refers back to a tradition where the mystery-goddess Isis is the disciple and spouse of the mysterious Chnum or Ammon, also known as Kneph or Kamephis, as Agathodaimon. He proposes that the idea of Kamephis being a disciple of Hermes is a later development of the tradition, from when Hermes-communities gained influence in certain circles of the Isis-tradition. This is very likely, but should we, with Reitzenstein, discard the traditional translation of kore kosmoy as "Virgin of the World" and instead title our treatise "The Pupil of the Eye of the World"? This new title may sound strange to unaccustomed ears and is quite different from other known titles of Hermetic texts. But what does "Virgin of the World" mean in relation to our treatise? For students of Egyptology, Isis as the Virgin Mother is a familiar concept; she is, by definition, the "World-Virgin."THE SON OF THE VIRGIN

It is interesting to consider a notable statement by Epiphanius. This statement was missing in all editions of his work before the one edited by Dindorf in Leipzig, 1859, which was based on a very early manuscript from the tenth century. Earlier editions were based on a heavily censored fourteenth-century manuscript.

Epiphanius claims that the true birthday of Christ is the Feast of Epiphany, "thirteen days after the increase of the light [i.e., December 25]. This is meant to symbolize our Lord Jesus Christ and His twelve disciples, who together represent the thirteen days of the increase of the Light." The Feast of Epiphany was an important day in Egypt, associated with the "Birth of the Aeon," a phase of the "Birth of Horus." Epiphanius continues:

"Many past and present events support and bear witness to this idea, the birth of Christ! The leaders of idol-cults, filled with deception, often hold their highest festival on this same night of Epiphany [= the Manifestation to Light] to prevent their followers from seeking the truth. For example, in Alexandria, at a place called Koreion--an immense temple, the Precinct of the Virgin--they keep an all-night vigil with songs and music, chanting to their idol. At cock-crow, they descend with lights into an underground crypt and carry up a wooden image lying naked on a litter. The image has a gold cross seal on its forehead, two similar seals on each hand, and two on each knee, making five gold seals in total."They carry the image around, circling the innermost temple seven times with the accompaniment of pipes, drums, and hymns. After celebrating, they take it back underground. When asked about the meaning of this ritual, they reply: "Today, at this hour, the Maiden (Kore), the Virgin, gave birth to the Aeon." Additionally, at Petra in Arabia, where this ritual is also performed, the Son of the Virgin is called a name meaning "Only Begotten of the Lord."

So, in Alexandria, where our text likely originates, there is a notable mystery-rite celebrated in the Temple of the Virgin, who gives birth to a Son, the Aeon. This likely signifies not only the start of a new year but also deeper mysteries, as indicated by the Naassene Document: "For such a man is the Virgin, pregnant, conceiving and bearing a Son—not physical or fleshly, but a blessed Aeon of Aeons"—an Eternal God. We should also note the crowing of the cock, which is significant in the crucifixion story in the Gospels, and especially the marks on the image, symbolizing a cosmic and human mystery.

THE MYSTERY OF THE BIRTH OF HORUS

In our text, the mysterious Birth of Horus is also mentioned. Isis has passed down the story of Osiris's arrival, the Divine emanation, and the descent of the Supreme's efflux. Horus asks: "How did the Earth receive God's efflux?"—where Earth likely refers to "Dark Earth," another name for Isis herself.And Isis responds: "I cannot tell the story of this birth; it is forbidden to explain how this descent originated, Horus, mighty son, lest humans learn the way the immortal gods are born." This seems to refer to the mysterious "Birth of Horus," which symbolizes how a person becomes a god, the most noble of souls, and gains mastery over themselves. This mystery was not yet to be revealed to the novice Horus. However, Hermes hints at this birth to Tat in C. H., xiii. (xiv.) 2, where he says: "Wisdom that understands in silence [is the matter and the womb from which Man is born] and the True Good is the Seed." The womb is the mysterious Silence, the matter is Wisdom (Isis herself), and the seed is the Good (Agathodaimon, Osiris). But in our treatise, Horus has not yet reached this high state; Isis, as the introductory words tell us, is only giving him "the first taste of immortality," which souls usually receive from gods. He is being raised to the understanding of a daimon, but not yet to that of a god. This seems to be part of the Isis mystery tradition, as Diodorus (i. 25), following Hecataeus, informs us: it was Isis who "discovered the potion of immortality. With this, when her son Horus, who had been attacked by the Titans and found dead in the water, she not only brought him back to life but also made him immortal." This shows that in the mystery-myth, Horus represented the human soul, and there were two interpretations of the mystery.The text discusses the concept of resurrection and immortality in simpler terms. It mentions that resurrection doesn't just mean coming back to life in another body, but also involves a higher mystery where the soul regains its awareness of immortality. This idea suggests that souls, not bodies, are the focus of stories involving the Titans, who represent opposing forces.

Isis, symbolizing the Mother Soul, repeatedly revives Horus from the "death" in the material world and eventually gives him the knowledge of immortality, thus raising him from the "dead."

The birth of the "true man" within, or the logos, is considered the greatest mystery for humans. In the chapter on the "Popular Theurgic Hermes-Cult," the sacramental phrase "Thou art I and I am thou" and the Gospel of Eve's reference to the Great Man and the Little Man are discussed. This idea is also present in Hindu-Aryan theosophy, which speaks of a "man" the size of a thumb within the heart's ether.

The term "Ishon," meaning "little man" or "dwarf," appears in Old Covenant documents, especially in prophetic and wisdom literature influenced by Hellenistic ideas. In the Authorized Version (A.V.), it is often translated as "apple of the eye." For example, Lamentations 2:18 says, "Let not the apple of thine eye cease," referring to weeping. It was commonly believed that the soul or intelligence resided in the eye and was most clearly expressed through it.The phrase "apple of the eye" was used to describe a person's most valuable possession, essentially the source of their vision or insight.

In the Bible, we read: "He [Yahweh] kept him [Israel] as the apple of his eye" (Psalm 17:8), where "ishon" in Hebrew is also called the "daughter of the eye." Similarly, "Thus says the Lord of Hosts: ... He who touches you touches the apple of his eye" (Zechariah 2:8). The "apple of the eye" (ishon) symbolized something very valuable and precious. Therefore, in the Wisdom literature, it is said that the punishment for a man who curses his parents is that "his lamp shall be put out in obscure (ishon) darkness" (Proverbs 20:20), meaning he will lose his intelligence or spiritual insight, symbolized by darkness in the "apple of his eye." This idea connects to a Psalm which suggests that wisdom is found in the innermost part of a person: "In the hidden part [of man] you will make me know wisdom" (Psalm 51:6).

Notably, in a Wisdom chapter in Proverbs, the true Israelite is warned to stay faithful to the Law (Torah) and avoid the "strange woman," representing the "false doctrines" of non-believers. "Keep my law as the apple of your eye" (Proverbs 7:2), the writer says, speaking for Yahweh, after observing the young and naive being led astray by the "strange woman." "He went the way to her house, in the twilight, in the evening; in the black (ishon) and dark night" (Proverbs 7:9), meaning his inner light was extinguished, leaving darkness in his eye, which should have been his true source of understanding Yahweh's wisdom.

This suggests that the idea of the pupil of the eye as the seat of spiritual intelligence was common in Hellenistic thought.Can we translate "kore kosmoy" as the "Apple of the World-Eye"? It's true that Isis is the medium for conveying hidden wisdom to Horus and that ultimately Hermes or the Logos is the true light shining through her. This light emerges from the darkness where she found herself when she received enlightenment from Kamephis. However, is this enough reason to reject the traditional translation of the title and adopt a new one? I think that while the new translation might seem a bit strained at first, as we get more used to the idea and consider the context of the time, we might be able to translate it this way. Isis, then, is the "Apple or Pupil of the Eye of Osiris." On earth, the "mysterious black" refers to Egypt itself, the land of wisdom. Isis embodies the mysterious wisdom of Egypt, but in our text, she represents the wisdom that is now truly enlightened by the new dawn of the Trismegistic teachings she discusses. To a Greek, the word "kore" would combine the meanings of both "virgin" and "pupil of the eye," similar to how "logos" means both "word" and "reason." Since there isn't a single English word that captures this dual meaning, we've stuck with the traditional translation.

THE SIXTY SOUL-REGIONS

Now, let's focus on a few of the most important points that need more detailed explanation than a footnote can provide. There are many other points that could be expanded upon, but doing so would make this work much longer. The number of degrees into which the soul-stuff (psychosis) is divided is given as three and sixty.If we only had this statement, we would be quite puzzled, even if we remembered the mystical idea that 60 is the number of the soul, and that understanding this number reveals the nature of the soul. Thankfully, if we look at S. I. H., 6 (Ex. xxvii.), we see that according to tradition, the soul-regions were divided into 60 spaces, likely representing different types of souls. These were organized into 4 main divisions and 60 specific spaces without overlapping. These spaces were also called zones, firmaments, or layers. Additionally, we learn that the lowest division, the one closest to the earth, has 4 spaces; the second division has 8 spaces; the third has 16 spaces; and the fourth has 32 spaces. Moreover, there were 12 intervallic divisions between the 4 main divisions. This adds some uncertainty because we don’t have clear information on how these intervallic divisions were arranged in the writer's mind. While speculation is risky, a possible scheme has come to my mind, which I share with caution. There are 4 main divisions or planes, separated by 3 determinations of some kind, as the entire order pertains to the Air, which might have been seen as having four states: earthy, watery, airy, and fiery Air. The 3 determinations might correspond to the three main grades or levels of the soul's substance, which seem to be of a superior nature.Each division of the four might have been seen as further divided by three intervals. This means we have three intervals in the lowest division, splitting it into four parts, each one unit long; three intervals in the second division, splitting it into four parts, each two units long; three intervals in the third division, splitting it into four parts, each four units long; and three intervals in the fourth division, splitting it into four parts, each eight units long. The total number of these intervals would be 12.

In this context, I cannot resist sharing a delightful story told by Plutarch.

The speaker is Cleombrotus, a wealthy gentleman from Sparta who loved traveling and collecting information for a philosophical religion. He spent much time in Egypt and even traveled beyond the Red Sea. During his travels, Cleombrotus heard about a philosopher-recluse who lived in complete seclusion, except for once a year when he appeared to the people around the Red Sea. During this time, divine inspiration would come upon him, and he would prophesy to the nobles and royal scribes who gathered to hear him. 

With great effort and expense, Cleombrotus found the hermitage of this recluse and received a warm welcome. The recluse was the most handsome man Cleombrotus had ever met, highly knowledgeable about plants, and a great linguist. He spoke to Cleombrotus in Doric, almost in verse, and "as he spoke, the place was filled with the sweetness of his breath."His knowledge of various mystery cults was profound, and his deep understanding of the unseen world was remarkable. He explained many things to Cleombrotus, particularly about the nature of daimones and their crucial role in interpreting ancient mythology. Most great myths, he said, referred to the actions of daimones rather than humans. Cleombrotus shared this to introduce a piece of information from the old philosopher about the plurality of worlds. He continued:

"The number of worlds is neither infinite, one, nor five, but 183. These are arranged in a triangle, with each side containing 60 worlds and one at each corner. The worlds on the sides are in contact, moving in a coordinated dance. The triangle's area is the Common Hearth of all, called the 'Plain of Truth,' where the ideas and patterns of everything that has been and will be lie immovable. Aeon (Eternity) surrounds these ideas, and time flows down upon the worlds like a stream. Human souls can only see and contemplate these truths once every ten thousand years if they have lived virtuous lives. The highest initiations here on Earth are merely a dream of that true vision and initiation. The teachings delivered in the mystic rites are designed to awaken the memory of the sublime truths above; otherwise, they are meaningless."This statement, I believe, is one of the clearest explanations of the higher mysteries from antiquity. It serves as a primary reference for any meaningful discussion on the true nature of philosophical mysteries. However, I have never seen it mentioned in this context. The old philosopher was familiar with the Egyptian mystery tradition, as Cleombrotus received information from him about the hidden meanings of Typhon and Osiris. What I have quoted fits well within the ideas of the tradition we're discussing. It addresses a higher aspect, claiming to be the highest understanding available, accessible only to the most righteous souls and only after long periods. The representation is, of course, symbolic. The triangle is not a literal triangle; it represents the "plain of truth," the "center of the universe." This triangle belongs to the realm of Fire, not Air. The arrangement of the "worlds" mirrors that of our soul spaces. The triangle is separated from the visible world by the Aeon; it exists outside space and time. Time flows from it. The proper worlds consist of three worlds or universes, each divided into 60 smaller universes, moving in an orderly harmony. Our soul spaces could be seen as reflections of these higher conditions. One might be tempted to turn the plane triangle into a solid figure, a tetrahedron, imagining a world or wheel at each of the four corners, and speculate on Ezekiel's Wheels, the prototype of the Mercabah or Heavenly Chariot of Kabalism, the Throne of Truth of the Supreme. But I will not test my readers' patience further, as most of them are probably already saying: Enough!### Boundaries of Numbers that Exist in the Soul

Before we conclude, it's worth briefly examining what Plato, following Pythagoras, says about the "boundaries" of all numbers that pre-exist in the soul. These numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, and 27, which combine two Pythagorean sequences: 1, 2, 4, 8 and 1, 3, 9, 27. These can also be written as 1, 2, 3, 2^2, 2^3, 3^2, 3^3.

In this system:
- The numbers 1, 2, and 3 are associated with the World-Soul in its intellectual or spiritual aspect. They represent:
  - 1: its existence,
  - 2: its emanation,
  - 3: its return to itself.
- Intermediate subtle natures or souls evolve and return under the World-Soul's guidance:
  - They evolve according to the power of 4 (2^2), which has generative powers,
  - They return according to the power of 9 (3^2), which unifies them.
- Solid or gross natures are guided:
  - They evolve according to 8 (2^3),
  - They return according to 27 (3^3).

From this, we derive a scheme of circular progression and conversion of the soul through various stages.

Comparing this to the "Chaldaean Oracle" (as cited by Psellus, 19): "Do not soil the spirit, nor turn the plane into the solid" (translated from Greek), we see that the four stages correspond to the point, line, plane, and solid. Also, it's important to note that x^0 = 1, 2^0 = 1, and 3^0 = 1.

These are the boundary numbers of the soul according to Pythagorean and Platonic tradition. However, how this aligns with the ordering of the soul-spaces in our treatise remains unclear.By adding these numbers together (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 8 + 9 + 27), we get 54. Then, by adding the World-Soul numbers (1 + 2 + 3), we get 6, making a total of 60. This seems a bit like what we used to call "fudging" in school. It's not very convincing, since it mixes specific numbers with general concepts as if they were equally important. However, the ancients often did this. There is more to Plato's numbers than just intellectual games, as shown by Adam's brilliant study on Plato's "nuptial number," which is based on the properties of the "Pythagorean triangle" (a right-angled triangle with sides of 3 and 4, and a hypotenuse of 5; 3 * 4 * 5 = 60). The numbers 3, 4, and 5, along with the sequences 1, 2, 4, 8, and 1, 3, 9, 27, were key to the Pythagoreans and Platonists' ideas of proportion.

However, this doesn't clearly explain the ordering of soul spaces in our treatise. It might be related to the mysterious 60's of Cleombrotus, but we don't have enough information to make a solid argument. It might have connections to Babylonian ideas, where 3 could be seen as "falling into" 4 to make 12, and this stage "falling into" 5 to make 60.**The Mysterious Cylinder**

It's important to note that before the souls rebelled, the Demiurge assigned them specific limits and reservations in the upper regions of nature to maintain the cylinder's proper order and function. This means they were restricted to certain arrangements and spaces. But what exactly is this mysterious "cylinder" they were supposed to keep turning? So far, I haven't found anything that directly explains it.

However, Proclus mentions that Porphyry stated the Egyptians used the letter X, surrounded by a circle, to symbolize the mundane soul. It's interesting that Porphyry attributed this idea to the Egyptians, even though he knew that Plato, whom Porphyry regarded as the leading philosopher, had discussed the significance of the symbol X (in Greek, χ) in a well-known passage of the Timaeus. This letter represented the relationship between the axes and equators of the sphere of the "same" (the fixed stars) and the sphere of the "other" (the seven planetary spheres). Porphyry might have believed that Plato or Pythagoras originally got this idea from Egypt, which was a common belief in his school.

Jowett describes this puzzle of Plato in his introduction to the Timaeus as follows:

"The universe revolves around a center once every twenty-four hours, but the orbits of the fixed stars move in a different direction than the planets. The outer and inner spheres cross each other and meet again at a point opposite their first contact. The first moves in a circle from left to right along the side of a parallelogram inscribed in it, and the second moves in a circle along the diagonal of the same parallelogram from right to left. In other words, the first describes the path of the equator, and the second describes the path of the ecliptic."We should, like the Egyptians did according to Porphyry, represent this concept using a circle with two diameters, symbolizing the equator and the ecliptic. But what is the rectangular figure mentioned by Jowett, which he does not describe in detail? The circles are actually spheres, so the rectangular figure must be a solid shape inside the sphere "of the same." If we rotate the circle parallel to the longer sides of the figure, this "parallelogram" will form a cylinder. Meanwhile, the seven spheres of the "other," representing the "souls" of the "planets," move parallel to one of the diagonals of our figure and in the opposite direction to the sphere of the "same." Their different speeds will make their "bodies" (the souls around the bodies) trace out spiral orbits. I admit, this idea seems very far-fetched, and I would have discarded my notes on the subject, except for the following consideration:

Basil of Caesarea, in his Hexaemeron, or Homilies on the Six Days of Creation, stated it "doesn't matter to us whether the earth is a sphere, a cylinder, a disk, or concave in the middle like a fan."

So, the idea of the earth being a cylinder was a popular theory in Basil's time, the fourth century. However, I think this cylinder idea is much older. In Greek speculation, we first encounter it in the little we know about Anaximander of Miletus, Thales' successor. Anaximander reportedly believed that "the earth is a heavenly body, controlled by no other power, and stays in place because it is equally distant from everything; its shape is curved and cylindrical, like a stone column, with two faces—one being the ground under our feet, and the other opposite to it."The text can be translated into modern English as follows:

"According to another idea, the earth is shaped like a cylinder, and its depth is one-third of its width.

I have never been convinced that the earliest Greek philosophers invented the ideas attributed to them. They probably took their ideas from ancient traditions, as they were on the border of mythology and mysticism.

Anaximander himself was likely influenced, either directly or indirectly, by Egyptian and Chaldean ideas. Given the findings from Cnossus, who can doubt this?

Anaximander is said to have believed that the earth-cylinder was stationary. However, in our text, the cylinder is not the earth and is not stationary; it is a celestial cylinder that is constantly moving. Could this cylinder idea be linked to a Babylonian concept, coming from the land known for its cylinders? In Babylonia, cylinder shapes were often used for seals, designed like small rollers to imprint characters or symbols onto soft materials like wax. Additionally, Babylonian and Egyptian civilizations were closely connected, especially in terms of seals and sigils. In Coptic-Gnostic texts translated from Greek and mainly of Egyptian origin, the idea of characters, seals, and sigils as imprints on matter is common. Could our cylinder be related to the circle of life types mentioned in our text? The souls of higher beings might have the role of keeping this cylinder in motion, continually imprinting various types onto the material in the realm of creation—the wheel of life."This might be the case, as in P.S.A. 19, it says: "The air is the engine or machine through which everything is created... mortal from mortal things and similar things." Likewise, in K.K. 28, Hermes states: "I will skillfully create an instrument, mysterious and with infallible sight... an instrument that connects all actions." Again, this reflects the idea of Fate or Heimarmene; Hermes' instrument is the Karmic Wheel, which links cause and effect with a moral purpose.

Additionally, we can compare our cylinder to the Aryan Hindu myth of the "Churning of the Ocean" in the Vishnu Purana. The churning staff or Pillar was the heaven-mountain, around which the cosmic serpent was coiled, serving as a rope for twirling it. The rope was held at either end by the Devas and Asuras, or gods and demons. In India, there is also a mystic symbol likely related to similar ideas: two superimposed triangles (hourglass) with their tips touching and a serpent coiled around the center, resembling our X and cylinder idea.

Now, let's move on to the four main types of animals associated with the highest-ranking souls: the eagle, lion, dragon, and dolphin. It might be interesting to compare this to the symbolism in some degrees of the Mithraic Mysteries. In one of the initial degrees of the rite, we are told that some initiates imitated the voices of birds, while others roared like lions. This was interpreted by the initiates as referring to transmigration or reincarnation.Porphyry tells us that in the Mysteries of Mithras, initiates were given animal names to symbolize human nature's connection with irrational animals. For example, some men were called "lions" and some women "lionesses," while others were called "ravens." The highest rank, the "fathers," were named "hawks" and "eagles." "Ravens" were the lowest rank, and those in the "lion" rank had to wear various animal disguises and masks before receiving the lion title. Porphyry also mentions that Pallas, who wrote a now-lost excellent treatise on Mithraic rituals, believed that these names were commonly thought to refer to the zodiac. However, he argued they actually symbolized the human soul, which embodies different animal natures, according to Magi traditions. For instance, the sun, and those associated with it, were called a bull, lion, dragon, and hawk.

Additionally, Appuleius describes the robe he wore after his initiation into the Mysteries of Isis. He says he was dressed as the sun, wearing twelve ceremonial garments made of linen with beautiful paintings. These garments, called the "Olympic Stole," had various animals painted in different colors, making him stand out.

Lastly, it may be helpful to understand Momus better. In Greek mythology, Momus was the spirit of fault-finding. Hesiod's "Theogony" places him among the second generation of Night's children, along with the Fates.From the Cypria of Stasimus, we learn that when Zeus, in response to Earth's plea to reduce the overpopulation of wicked humans, first initiated the Theban War, and then considered destroying humanity with thunderbolts and floods, Momus advised him to marry the goddess Thetis to a mortal. This union would produce a beautiful daughter (Aphrodite-Helen), causing both Greeks and Barbarians to engage in the Trojan War over her.

Additionally, the Scholiast on the Iliad, i. 5, claims that Momus was represented by the "will" or "counsel" of Zeus in Homer's works. Sophocles also wrote a satyric drama called "Momus," as did Achaeus.

Both Plato and Aristotle mention Momus. Callimachus, the head librarian of the Alexandrian Library from 260-240 B.C., criticized his former student Apollonius Rhodius as Momus in his work Aetia. Momus was a popular figure among Sophists and Rhetoricians, especially in the second century A.D. In the writings of Aelian Aristides, Momus, unable to find fault with Aphrodite herself, criticized her shoe. Lucian depicts Aphrodite vowing to oppose Momus fiercely and shows Momus criticizing even the greatest works of the gods, such as Athene's house, Zeus's bull, and Hephaestus's men, because they lacked windows to show their hearts.

Interestingly, in one of Lucian's witty sketches, Momus appears in a dialogue with Zeus and Hermes. Momus complains about Bacchus being among the gods and is ordered by Zeus to stop mocking Hercules and Asclepius.The popular image of Momus was that of a weak old man, quite different from the grandiose Intelligence described in our treatise, resembling a true Lucifer. Some depictions show him with a single sharp tooth, while others give him wings. The story goes that Zeus eventually banished him from Olympus due to his constant criticism.

The Onomastica Vaticana associates Momus with Mammon, but we don't need to delve into that side issue.

THE MYSTIC GEOGRAPHY OF SACRED LANDS

Regarding the symbolic figure of the Earth in sections 46-48 of the second K. K. Extract, and the belief that Egypt was its heart or center, we can add two quotations on the topic from different perspectives. The first is from Dr. Andrew D. White's recent books:

"Every great ancient civilization usually considered its central city or most holy place as the center of the earth. The Chaldeans believed their 'holy house of the gods' was the center. The Egyptians depicted the world as a human figure, with Egypt as the heart and Thebes as its center. For the Assyrians, it was Babylon; for the Hindus, it was Mount Meru; for the Greeks, as far as the civilized world was concerned, it was Olympus or the temple of Delphi; for modern Muslims, it is Mecca and its sacred stone. The Chinese still refer to their empire as the 'middle kingdom.' It was a simple tendency of human thought, then, that led the Jews to believe Jerusalem was the center of the world. The book of Ezekiel describes Jerusalem as being in the middle of the earth, with all other parts of the world arranged around the holy city. Throughout the 'ages of faith,' this belief was generally accepted as a direct revelation from God about the earth's form."Saint Jerome, a leading Biblical authority in the early Church, claimed based on a prophet's words that Jerusalem was at the center of the earth. This idea was repeated by Archbishop Kabanus Maurus in the ninth century and supported by Hugh of St. Victor in the eleventh century. Pope Urban, in his famous sermon at Clermont urging the Crusades, said, "Jerusalem is the middle point of the earth." In the thirteenth century, the monk Caesarius of Heisterbach compared Jerusalem's location to the heart in the human body, stating, "So it was that Christ was crucified at the center of the earth." Dante also embraced this view in his poetry, and Sir John Mandeville's widely read travel book from the Middle Ages claimed that Jerusalem was at the world's center, with a spear at the Holy Sepulchre casting no shadow at the equinox.

Ezekiel's statement became the standard for early map-makers. Maps like the one at Hereford Cathedral, and those by Andrea Bianco and Marino Sanuto, reinforced this belief and likely discouraged scientific challenges to this Scriptural geographic center for many generations.

Now, regarding modern physical science and cryptology: M. W. Blackden, in a recent article on "The Mysteries and the 'Book of the Dead,'" states:

"One other key there is... without which it is useless to approach The Book of the Dead with the idea of discussing any of those gems of wisdom for which old Egypt was so famous..."The knowledge of its existence is not a new discovery. Ancient civilizations like the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Jews had a system of symbolic geography. The Jewish and Egyptian priests tried to map their lands according to spiritual symbols, as much as the physical landscape allowed. This symbolism included mountains, cities, plains, deserts, and rivers, and extended from the parts and furnishings of the Lodge, in Masonic terms, to the spiritual anatomy of both the universe and the individual.

In the Jewish Scriptures, we can see this symbolism in the prophetic battles around Jerusalem, similar to what is expressed in John Bunyan's "The Siege of Mansoul." Bunyan, also the author of "The Pilgrim's Progress," understood the value of geographical symbolism.

While I can't delve deeply into the geographical symbols of Egypt here, it would take too long. However, as I mentioned Jerusalem as a symbol, I can say that Jerusalem corresponds to the Egyptian city of On, or Heliopolis. Astronomically, it represents the center of the world and universe, and in the microcosm, it symbolizes the spiritual heart of man.

There is a difference between the Hebrew and Egyptian cities. The actual Jerusalem, according to Hebrew prophets, represents the present Jerusalem, which is in bondage with her children. In contrast, Heliopolis among the Egyptian priests symbolized the heavenly city, the new heart that would be given to redeemed humanity. This topic deserves a book of its own, so I leave it to someone willing to take on the task.**Footnotes**

He describes the consummation of the world-process and the final ascension of the "Sonship" with all its experience gained from union with matter. He says that the remaining souls, which have not achieved the dignity of the Sonship, will experience the Great Ignorance for a time. "Thus all the souls in this state of existence, which are meant to remain immortal only in this state, will remain without knowledge of anything different or better. There will be no rumors or knowledge of superior things in higher states, to prevent the lower souls from suffering by striving for impossible goals—like fish longing to feed on mountains with sheep, which would lead to their destruction. All things are indestructible if they stay in their proper condition, but are subject to destruction if they try to exceed their natural limits" (F. F. F., p. 270).

Regarding the "spiritual" or "aerial" body, it is made up of sub-elements with a dominance of "air," similar to how the physical body has a dominance of "earth." – Philoponus, Introduction to Aristotle's 'On the Soul'; see my book 'Orpheus' (London, 1896), "The Subtle Body," pp. 276-281. See also S. I. H., 15, 20.

Diogenes Laertius' introduction states: "The Egyptians say that Hephaestus (Ptah) was the son of the Nile, and that he was the originator of philosophy, a philosophy led by priests and prophets"—that is, a mystical philosophy of revelation.

Similarly, Suidas (under "Ptah") mentions that Ptah was the Hephaestus of the Memphite priesthood and that there was a saying among them: "Ptah has spoken to you." This reminds us of our text: "As Hermes says when he speaks to me."

The image of Isis as the speaker of "sacred sermons," presenting herself as the daughter or disciple of Hermes, dates back to Ptolemaic times.

The phrase "when she honored me with the ultimate ink" has been interpreted by scholars as referring to the mysteries of writing, often taken very seriously. However, it humorously suggests the schooldays of Isis when she first learned to write. Even Meineke repeats this absurd interpretation.The more accurate title of this work should be "Gnostic Notes according to the True Philosophy," as Clement himself mentions and as Hort noted in his Ante-Nicene Fathers, p. 87 (London, 1895). Sopater (Dist. Quaest., p. 123, ed. Walz) refers to these as "figures" (sxe'mata), the same term Proclus (In Plat. Rep., p. 380) uses when discussing the forms the Gods take in their manifestations. Plato (Phaedr., p. 250) calls them "blessed apparitions" or "beatific visions" (eydaimona fasmata). The author of the Epinomis (p. 986) describes them as "the most beautiful things to see in the world." These are the "mystic sights" or "wonders" (mystika theamata) mentioned by Dion Chrysostom (Orat., xii., p. 387, ed. Reiske), the "holy appearances" (agia fantasmata) and "sacred shows" (iera deiknumena) of Plutarch (Wyttenbach, Fragm., vi. 1, t. v., p. 722, and De Profect. Virtut. Sent., p. 81, ed. Reiske), the "ineffable apparitions" (arreta fasmata) of Aristides (Orat., xix. p. 416, ed. Dindorf), and the "divine apparitions" (theia fasmata) of Himerius (Eclog., xxxii., p. 304, ed. Wernsdorf). These sublime sights were said to accompany the souls of the righteous into the afterlife and when they returned to birth. See Lenormant (F.) on "The Eleusinian Mysteries" in The Contemporary Review (Sept. 1880), p. 416, who argues that these philosophers and writers exaggerated their descriptions for mere mechanical figures and stage effects of the lower degrees. Refer to my "Notes on the Eleusinian Mysteries" in The Theosophical Review (April, May, June, 1898), vol. xxii., p. 156.

Leadbeater suggests that "Pontius Pilate" is a fictional term representing "pontos piletos," meaning the "dense sea" of "matter" where the soul is immersed. For a discussion on this theory, see D. T. L., pp. 423 ff.

A colleague shared an intriguing note from "Texts and Studies, iv. 2, Coptic Apocryphal Gospels" (p. 177, Frag. 4). The Sahidic text appears in Rendiconti della R. Accademia dei Lincei, vol. iii., sem. 2, pp. 381-384 (Frammenti Copti, Nota Via) by Ignazio Guidi (1887). According to the legend, the Devil, taking the form of a fisherman, meets Jesus and His disciples as they descend from the Mount. The Devil claims that catching fish in the desert would be a true wonder, not in the waters. They then engage in a contest of skill, but the manuscript cuts off before revealing the outcome. In this fragment, an intriguing sentence appears: "Now as Pilate was speaking before the authorities of Tiberius, the king, Herod, could not help but mock Pilate, saying, 'You are a Galilean foreign Egyptian Pontus.'" The direct translation from Coptic is: "You are a Pontus Galilean foreign Egyptian."

For comparison, refer to Kathopanishad, Sec. ii., Pt. ii., iv. 11, 12: "The Man, of the size of a thumb, resides within the self, lord of past and future; from him, one cannot hide. This verily is That. The Man, of the size of a thumb, like a flame free from smoke, lord of past and future, remains the same today and tomorrow. This verily is That." (Translated by Mead and Chattopadhyaya, London, 1896, i. 68, 69)."Today" and "tomorrow" are thought by some to refer to different incarnations; the "Man" (purusha) is the potential Self, eventually destined to become the Great Self (Maha-purusha). For more information, see the article "Theosophic Light on Bible Shadows" in The Theosophical Review (Nov. 1904), xxxv. 230, 231.

The tiny image of a person reflected in the pupil of another's eye may partly explain the popular belief behind this identification.

This idea is also found in connection with Ammon. In Hebrew orthodoxy, the phrase "to go a-whoring" after strange gods and doctrines was commonly used; "to commit fornication" in the New Testament often reflects the same idea.

For the latest study on this subject, see Monseur (E.), "L'Ame Pupilline," Rev. de l'Hist. des Relig. (Jan. and Feb. 1905), discussing the importance of the reflected image seen in the pupil of the eye in primitive religion. This "little man" was believed to be the soul of the eye, controlling its functions.

For the ancient perspective, refer to Tim. 45 B: "They formed into a substance a gentle light akin to everyday light, and the pure fire within us they made flow through the eyes in a smooth, dense stream, keeping out coarser elements and allowing only the pure element to pass."

For more details, see De Defectu Oraculorum, xxi., xxii. (421A-422C), edited by G. N. Bernardakis (Leipzig, 1891), iii. 97-101. Also, refer to my paper "Plutarch's Yogi" in The Theosophical Review (Dec. 1891), ix. 295-297.In the Timaeus (55 C-D), it's stated: "Anyone who thinks carefully about this and asks whether the number of worlds is infinite or finite will likely think that believing in an infinite number shows a lack of understanding. However, someone who questions whether there are one or five worlds is taking a more reasonable stance" (Jowett's Translation, 3rd edition, iii. 475, 476). 

As mentioned in S. I. H., 3: "I feel as though I have been initiated into a nature that goes beyond death, having traversed the Plain of Truth"; and in K. K., 22: "The Monarch came, and sitting on the Throne of Truth, responded to their prayers." The main source of this idea is Plato's Phaedrus, 248 B.

Additionally, K. K., 37 says: "Those who, taught by Hermes, know that the earthly things are connected to the divine, established sacred rites on earth that reflect the mysteries of heaven."

Our challenge is that Plutarch, through one of his characters, dismisses the idea that this numbering is Egyptian, attributing it instead to Petron of Himera in Sicily, hinting at a probable Pythagorean link.

For further information, see "Some Outlines of Aeonology" in F. F. F., pp. 311-335, and my book Orpheus (London, 1896), pp. 255-262. Also, refer to Taylor's "Introduction to Timaeus" in Works of Plato (London, 1804), p. 442.

In Republic, viii. 545C-547A, see Adam’s The Nuptial Number of Plato: Its Solution and Significance (London, 1891).

These ideas may have been seen as prototypes for soul-spaces.

For more context, see Commentaries on Plato's Timaeus, 216C by C. E. C. Schneider (Vratislaviae, 1847), p. 250, and Proclus' explanation using the "harmonic canon" or ruler (op. cit., 213A, ed. Sch., p. 152).

Jowett (B.) also provides further insights.Convert the following text into modern English; correct and simplify the text without altering its original meaning:

Dialogues of Plato (3rd ed., Oxford, 1892), iii. 403.

Compare with text 36C: "The motion of the same he carried round by the side to the right, and the motion of the diverse diagonally to the left,"—which means the side of the rectangle inscribed in the circle of the "same," and diagonally, across the rectangle from corner to corner; and 38D, 39A: "Now, when all the stars necessary for the creation of time [i.e., the spheres of the sun, moon, and five planets] had attained suitable motion, and had become living beings, fastened by vital chains, and learned their tasks, moving in the motion of the diverse, which is diagonal and governed by the motion of the same, they revolved, some in larger and some in smaller orbits. . . . The motion of the same made them turn all in a spiral." Compare this idea of time with the concept of time flowing down on the worlds from the Aeon in the story of Cleombrotus. 

Quoted in Andrew Dickson White's History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom (New York, 1898), i. 92. Dr. White, unfortunately, does not provide the exact reference. The "fan" mentioned is a winnowing fan, a broad basket used to throw corn mixed with chaff into the wind, dispersing the chaff and leaving the grain.

Compare Clement of Alexandria on the Basilidian idea of "appendages," noting that the Basilides School was heavily influenced by Egyptian thought. The Basilidians call the passions "appendages." They claim these essences exist substantially and attach to the rational soul due to some initial disorder. Other foreign essences like those of wolves, apes, lions, goats, etc., attach to this core. Human souls not only link with animal impulses and impressions but also imitate plant movements and characteristics because they have plant traits attached to them. They even exhibit mineral traits, such as the hardness of adamant (F. F. F., page 276).

**EXCERPT XXVII. FROM THE SERMON OF ISIS TO HORUS**

Patrizzi (p. 34b) continues without a break. Text from Stob., Phys., xli. 68, 69, under the heading "Of Hermes: A Sermon of Isis to Horus"; G. pp. 476-481; M. i. 342-352; W. i. 458-472. Menard: Livre III., No. iii. of "Fragments," etc., as above, pp. 209-221.

1. **[*1]** In a marvelous way—(Horus said)—you have explained to me, mighty mother Isis, the details of God's wondrous soul-making, and I remain in awe; but you have not yet told me where the souls go when freed from the body. I would be grateful to be initiated by your words into this vision of the soul, **[*2]** O only mother, deathless one!

2. And Isis said:

Listen, my son; this research is essential. That which holds together also has a place that does not disappear. For this is what my sermon will explain.Oh, wondrous and powerful son of the mighty Osiris, when souls leave their bodies, they don't just scatter into the air and disappear into the vast expanse, never to return to bodies again. It's not like water taken from the bottom of a jar, which can't be poured back into the exact same spot it came from, and which mixes with the rest of the water when put back. Souls are different, noble Horus.

As someone who has experienced the nature beyond death and walked the path of truth, I'll explain this to you in detail. Water is a mindless substance made from various compounds, forming a fluid mass. In contrast, the soul is unique and divine, crafted by God's hands and guided by its own nature.

What comes from one source and not another can't mix with something different. Therefore, the soul's union with the body is a deliberate act of God. Souls aren't randomly sent back to one place but each returns to its proper region, as shown by what the soul experiences while still in the body. Pay close attention to this analogy, beloved Horus!Imagine a single cage containing men, eagles, doves, swans, swallows, hawks, sparrows, flies, snakes, lions, leopards, wolves, dogs, hares, cattle, sheep, and some amphibious animals like seals, tortoises, and crocodiles. Now, my son, picture them all being released at once. Each creature will instinctively go to where it belongs: 

- Men will return to their homes and rooftops.
- Eagles will soar into the sky where they naturally live.
- Doves will fly into the nearby air.
- Hawks will fly higher above the doves.
- Swallows will go where people live.
- Sparrows will flock around fruit trees.
- Swans will seek places to sing.
- Flies will stay close to the ground but never far from humans, as they are particularly drawn to people.
- Lions and leopards will head for the hills.
- Wolves will seek out deserted areas.
- Dogs will follow human tracks.
- Cattle will go to stalls and fields.
- Sheep will graze in pastures.
- Snakes will hide in the earth.
- Seals and tortoises will return to the water, maintaining their connection to both land and sea.

Each being returns to its rightful place through its natural instincts. Similarly, every soul, whether in human form or another, knows where it belongs, unless someone foolishly claims that a bull can live in water or a tortoise can fly.

Even while in physical form, these creatures act according to their nature, despite being punished by their embodiment. How much more will they follow their true nature when they are free from such punishment and physical constraints? This is the holy order of souls.Look up, noble son, and observe the order of things. The space from the height of heaven to the moon is dedicated to the gods, stars, and providence. The space from the moon to us is the dwelling place of souls. The air, however, contains a belt we call the wind, which moves to refresh the earth. This movement does not hinder souls; they can move freely up and down without any obstacles, passing through like water through oil.

This interval, Horus, my son, has four main divisions and sixty specific spaces. The first division from the earth consists of four spaces, reaching up to certain mountain peaks. The second division has eight spaces where the winds move. Pay attention, for you are learning sacred mysteries about earth, heaven, and the air between, which contains the movement of winds and the flight of birds. Above this, the air is still and lifeless. This moving air can circulate within its spaces and the four spaces of earth, but the earth cannot rise into it. The third division consists of sixteen spaces filled with pure, subtle air. The fourth division comprises thirty-two spaces with the finest, subtlest air, which separates itself from the fiery heavens above.This ordering is in a straight line, with no overlap, creating four main divisions, twelve intervals, and sixty spaces. Each of these sixty spaces houses souls according to their nature. While all souls are made of the same substance, they differ in rank. The higher a space is from the earth, the more eminent the souls that reside there. 

I will now tell you, Horus, son of great renown, about the souls that occupy each space, from the highest down to the earth. 

8. The air between the earth and the heavens, Horus, is measured and harmonized. These spaces are called zones, firmaments, or layers by our ancestors. Souls that have been freed from their bodies, as well as those that have never been in a body, reside in these spaces. Each soul lives in the place it deserves. The godly and kingly souls dwell in the highest spaces, the least honorable and most decadent ones in the lowest, and the average souls in the middle. The souls sent down to rule come from the upper zones, and when they are freed, they return to the same or even higher zones, unless they have acted against their nature and the Law of God. Such souls are banished to lower spaces according to their sins, while those lower in dignity and power are raised to higher ones by Divine Providence.Above everyone, there are two ministers of universal Providence: one guards the souls, and the other guides them. The guardian watches over the souls when they are out of their bodies, while the guide dispatches and distributes souls into their bodies. The guardian keeps them safe, and the guide sends them forth according to God's Will. For this reason, my son, earthly nature shapes and forms bodies based on the deeds above. Two forces, experience and memory, assist her.

Memory ensures that nature maintains the type of each soul sent down from its source and keeps its mixture as it is above. Experience ensures that each descending soul receives a fitting body. For instance, swift souls get swift bodies, slow souls get slow bodies, active souls get active bodies, sluggish souls get sluggish bodies, powerful souls get powerful bodies, and crafty souls get crafty bodies, making each body suitable for its soul.

Nature has intentionally given wings to flying creatures, endowed rational beings with heightened and precise senses, and equipped some four-footed animals with strength through horns, teeth, claws, or hooves. Creeping creatures have flexible bodies covered in scales for easy movement. To ensure that aquatic creatures are not entirely weak, nature has provided some with sharp fangs, making them formidable due to the fear of death they instill. Because swimming creatures are timid, they live in an environment where light cannot exert its power, as fire in water neither illuminates nor heats.Each creature, whether covered in scales or spines, swims in the water and flees from what frightens it, using the water to hide.

Souls are placed into different bodies based on their similarities. Those with the ability to judge become humans; those without it become four-legged animals, ruled by force. The crafty souls become reptiles, as they sneak and ambush rather than confront directly. Fearful or less worthy souls become aquatic creatures. However, in each category, some beings don't follow their typical nature.

Horus asked, "What do you mean, mother?" Isis replied:

For example, a human might act without judgment; a four-legged animal might avoid using force; reptiles might lose their cunning; and birds might lose their fear of humans. This explains the hierarchy of souls and the formation of their bodies.

In every category, my son, there are some regal souls. Others come with various traits: some fiery, some cold, some arrogant, some gentle, some skilled, some unskilled, some lazy, and some hardworking. This diversity comes from the regions from which the souls descend to embody their forms.

From the regal zone, souls descend to rule, as there are many forms of sovereignty: some rule souls, some bodies, some arts, some sciences, and some rule themselves. "What do you mean, mother, by 'rule ourselves'?"For example, son, it is your father Osiris who rules over the souls of those born after us up to this time. The prince of each race rules over their bodies. The king of wisdom and guidance for all is Thrice-greatest Hermes; for medicine, it's Asclepius, son of Hephaestus; for power and might, it's Osiris, and after him, you, my son; for philosophy, it's Arnebeschenis; and for poetry, it's Asclepius-Imuth.

Generally, my son, if you investigate, you'll find many rulers governing various things and people. The one who rules everything comes from the highest realm, while those who rule parts of it belong to the specific realm they come from. Those from the regal zone play a more dominant role; those from the fire zone work with fire; those from the watery zone live their lives in water; those from the zone of science and art are engaged in arts and sciences; and those from the zone of inactivity live idle lives. The sources of all earthly actions and creations come from above, and they provide us their essences precisely. Nothing exists that hasn't come from above and will eventually return there before descending again.

What do you mean by this, mother? Tell me! And Isis replied: Most holy Nature has given living creatures a clear sign of this return. The breath we take from the air above, we exhale and inhale again. We have organs that perform this function, and when they can no longer receive breath, we die. Furthermore, son, there are additional elements added to us beyond the physical composition of our bodies.

What, then, is this composition, mother? asked Horus.The four elements come together and mix, creating a certain vapor that is surrounded by the soul but moves within the body, sharing qualities with both. This interaction causes changes in both the soul and the body. 

If the body has more fire, the soul, naturally hot, becomes even hotter and more fiery, making the individual more energetic and passionate, and the body quick and active. 

If there is more air, the individual becomes light, springy, and unstable in both soul and body. 

If there is more water, the person becomes flexible, easy-going, and sociable, able to connect with others easily because water can mix with anything. When water is abundant, it dissolves what it surrounds, but when there is little, it blends into what it touches. These individuals have bodies that are not tightly bound and can be easily weakened by illness, gradually falling apart.

If there is more earth, the person's soul is dull, as it has a dense body that doesn't allow for quick movement or sensation. The body is firm but heavy and sluggish, requiring strength to move.

When the elements are balanced, the individual is energetic for action, light for movement, well-mixed for interaction, and excellent at holding things together.According to the elements they contain, creatures are formed in different ways. Those with more fire and air become birds, living near the elements they originated from. Those with a balance of fire, air, earth, and water become humans, with the excess heat turning into intelligence. This heat doesn't burn but allows the mind to understand everything.

Creatures with more water and earth, but moderate air and little fire, become quadrupeds. Among them, those with more heat are stronger. Creatures with equal amounts of earth and water become reptiles, which lack courage and straightforwardness due to their low fire content. They are cold because of the water, heavy and sluggish because of the earth, but can move easily thanks to the air.

Those with more moisture and less dryness become fish. They are timid and try to hide due to their lack of heat and air. Their excess water and earth make them suited to live in fluid environments like water.

The growth of bodies, especially humans, depends on the balance of these elements. Other animals are proportioned according to the energy in each element.

Lastly, my dear friend, I say that an animal remains healthy as long as the elements within it—heat, air, moisture, and density—maintain their natural balance and don't take on other qualities.If the elements in the body do not stay in their original proportions and instead increase too much—I'm not talking about their energy or changes in sex and body due to growth, but rather the balance of the elements like heat—then the body will become sick. If both the heat and air elements increase, the person will experience vivid dreams and ecstasies because the body's elements are out of balance. The earthy element solidifies the body, the watery element keeps it fluid, the airy element allows for movement, and fire completes the process.

When the elements first combine, they produce a kind of vapor that mixes with the soul and influences its nature, for better or worse. If the soul maintains its original balance with this vapor, it remains stable. However, if an external factor causes an imbalance in this mixture, it changes the nature of the vapor, which then affects the soul or body. The fire and air elements rise towards the soul, which is in their realm, while the watery and earthy elements sink down towards the body, which is their domain.The initiate, generally speaking, received their initiation through spoken word, while the observer experienced it through sight or vision. ^188:3 theuria. ^189:1 Reading "epixein" for "epexein." ^189:2 The construction of the entire paragraph above is extremely complex. ^191:1 "tis tun tyfuniun" is an interesting phrase, indicating that Typhon was seen as the enemy of Osiris (the Logos or Reason). ^192:1 Refer to the beginning of the Apocalypse of Thespesius (Aridaeus) in Plutarch's "De Sera Num.

COMMENTARY

ARGUMENT

The sermon from which this extract is taken clearly belongs to the same category of literature as the K. K. Excerpts. The writer is a higher-degree initiate, imparting knowledge to his pupil verbally. [p. 205]

However, he claims to have "seen," for he has been immersed in the Cup of Immortality and has crossed the Plain of Truth (3). 1. The topic is the state of souls after death (1-3). The teaching is given through analogy and similitude (4). Each soul naturally seeks its proper place in the unseen world. 5.The arrangement of spaces for the souls after death is then described. These spaces are all in the "great air," the region between the Earth's surface and the moon. This large area is divided into 4 main sections and 60 smaller spaces, with the sections containing 4, 8, 16, and 32 sub-spaces respectively. Above the second section from the bottom, there is no air movement; the "wind" or "moving air" zone belongs mainly to the second section but also influences the first or lowest section, which stretches from the Earth's surface to the tops of the highest mountains. Additionally, there are 12 "intervallic" divisions within these 4 main sections and 60 spaces.

Everything is arranged with precision and harmony, and after death, every soul moves to its designated space, ascending and descending according to an infallible law of Providence. To manage this system, there are two ministers of Providence: one oversees souls outside their bodies, and the other returns them to suitable bodies. These bodies are created to perfectly match the souls' past actions and characters, with the help of experience and memory.

The nature of the soul is influenced by its location in the air-spaces or zones, especially for those of a royal type. The names and roles of some of these royal souls are given. In summary, everything is ordered from above; the source of all is in the soul-spaces, and as all souls come from there, they will all return there. This process is explained as being determined by a certain connection between soul and body, a kind of essence or vapor arising from the elements that make up the body.It is a kind of ethereal connection between the soul and the body; it moves through the body but also interacts with the soul, which is not considered to be inside the body but rather surrounding it. In other words, the body is within the soul, not the soul within the body. Health depends on maintaining a proper balance of the "vapors" of this "ethereal double." Additionally, increasing vitality or intensity in these elements of the "vapor" helps in remembering symbolic dreams and entering a state of ecstasy. Ultimately, it is the fiery element of this "vapor" that dissolves this "spiritual body." This link allows changes to occur from the soul to the body and vice versa. Unfortunately, Stobaeus ends his excerpt here.

The "Sermon of Isis to Horus" extract is so similar in style and context to the K. K. excerpts that we might consider it part of the same treatise. However, if this were the case, Stobaeus would likely have titled it "from the same," following his usual practice. He may have made an error, as sometimes happens. For example, in Excerpt xxi., he claims it is also from "The [Sermon] of Isis to Horus," but this cannot be correct since Isis addresses a certain king as her pupil, not Horus. Furthermore, at the beginning of our excerpt, Horus clearly states that Isis has already explained "the details of God's wondrous soul-making" and thanks her "for being made initiate by word of mouth into the vision of the soul," which directly references the contents of the K. K. excerpts.I believe that not only is it an extension of the instructional text following immediately after "K. K.," but even if it were considered part of the same sermon, and "The Sermon of Isis to Horus" was just a subtitle or alternative name for "Virgin of the World," this idea couldn't be easily dismissed.

In any case, it is clear that "S. I. H." belongs to the same category as "K. K." It is part of the same type of Trismegistic literature, similar to the treatise from which Cyril quotes fragments 19, 20, and 21, where Osiris is a disciple of the Good Daimon, Trismegistus.

In "S. I. H." as in "K. K.," Isis is presented as someone who has attained knowledge beyond death, having "crossed the Plain of Truth." The writer claims to have achieved a level of enlightenment that grants humans the awareness of the gods. Thus, "Isis" here is not a common title for all priests, as Jamblichus says of "Hermes" without the "Thrice-greatest" honorific, but rather denotes a particular level of initiation. The teacher of this lower level, or Horus-level, is a representative of Hermes. Isis was often seen as the Lady of all wisdom and teacher of all magic. Even in the earliest Hellenistic period, she had attributes similar to Thoth-Hermes, and she appears as the Orderer of the world. Like Thoth, she is also called the Lady of the heart and tongue, meaning her attributes were those of the Logos.There existed secret mystical and prophetic texts attributed to Isis and Horus, as evidenced by Lucian. In one of his humorous sketches, Lucian has Pythagoras say:

"I also traveled to Egypt to meet the wise prophets, and I went down into the temple shrines to study the Books of Isis and Horus."

According to Manetho, these Books, like those of Hermes, were kept hidden in the most sacred parts of the temples. Pythagoras had to "descend" to access them, suggesting the shrines were underground. Horus, who succeeded Osiris as a powerful and wise ruler, is also known as the lord of philosophy. This is evident from the name Arnebeschenis, or Har-nebeschenis, which means "Horus, lord of Letopolis," an important city in the Delta, as shown by Spiegelberg.

In Alchemical literature, Horus is also depicted as an author, as seen in the title "Horus the Gold-miner to Cronus who is Ammon." Here, Horus is to Isis what Asclepius is to Hermes. Just as Asclepius wrote to Ammon, Horus wrote to Ammon. While the earlier traditions viewed Cronus (Ammon) as a foundational teacher, later writings depicted Ammon as a king instructed by Asclepius or Horus.

The writer of S. I. H. explains that the soul, in its royal state, is divine. However, in its incarnate form, it is connected to the "watery plasm" or subtle body. Hermes mentions using more water than necessary when creating it, and the soul refers to this as a "watery sphere" in its lament.This combination makes it dense "against its proper nature," and it becomes even denser due to a "vaporous" quality that connects it to the physical body. Philoponus provides insight on this topic:

"They [the ancients] also believed that the soul exercises a plant-like and formative life in those airy and spirituous bodies after death. These bodies are nourished, not like our earthly bodies through digestion, but by absorbing vapors everywhere, much like sponges. Therefore, wise people in this life should consume a lighter and drier diet to keep the spirituous body within us from becoming too dense. The ancients also used purifications, or catharms, to cleanse this spirituous body, akin to how we wash our physical bodies with water. Some vapors nourish, while others purify. They further stated that this spirituous body is not organized into parts but senses and perceives everything as a whole."

THE HABITAT OF EXCARNATE SOULS

Returning to our main discussion, the dwelling-place of excarnate souls is the Air, a sublunary region with four main layers that become increasingly finer as they move farther from the earth. The upper limit of the Air borders the fiery or aetheric realms, where the gods reside.In the various layers of the atmosphere, not only do souls reside between their incarnations, but also those souls that have never been in a body, likely referring to daimones. When it comes to how souls are kept in their specific areas after death and how they are returned to suitable bodies, along with the two ministers of Providence, it's worth noting that this is briefly outlined in the Coptic Gnostic work called Pistis Sophia. However, explaining the Egyptian Gnostic work in detail would take up too much space here, and since the text is available in English, readers can easily refer to it themselves.

**References and Fragments in the Church Fathers**

### I. Justin Martyr

**Cohortatio ad Gentiles, xxxviii.; Otto (J. C. T.), ii. 122 (2nd ed., Jena, 1849).**

**The Most Ancient Philosophers**

If anyone believes they have learned about God from the most ancient philosophers mentioned among you, let them listen to Ammon and Hermes. Ammon, in his Writings, calls God "utterly hidden," while Hermes clearly states:

"Understanding God is difficult; speaking of Him is impossible, even for one who understands."

**The "Writings of Ammon"**

This passage appears at the very end of the treatise. Justin asserts that the most ancient philosophers support his view. These philosophers are Ammon and Hermes. Additionally, Justin refers to certain Writings or Sacred Utterances of Ammon, which must have been available in Greek, as it is hard to see how Justin would have known about them otherwise. These writings were likely apocalyptic, in the form of a self-revelation by Ammon or God. These "Writings of Ammon" have no connection to the Ammonian type of Trismegistic literature that survives today, where Ammon is a listener rather than an instructor, and certainly not the supreme instructor or Agathodaimon.In these texts, we observe a stage where Hellenistic theological literature directly depends on Egyptian originals. We have preserved certain hymns from the El-Khargeh Oasis, inscribed with "The Secret Words of Ammon" found on tables of mulberry wood.

THE INEFFABILITY OF GOD

A sentence from Hermes comes from a lost sermon, with a fragment preserved in an excerpt by Stobaeus. This was likely the opening of what Stobaeus calls "The Sermon to Tat," probably one of the "Expository Sermons to Tat," as referred to by Lactantius.

The idea expressed in the saying was common in Hellenistic theological thought and doesn't always need to be directly linked to Plato's famous words: "Finding the Father and Maker of the universe is a great task, and telling about Him is impossible." Interestingly, Justin reproduces the Hermetic text more accurately than when he directly quotes Plato.

HERMES AND ASCLEPIUS, SONS OF GOD

When we claim that the Word (Logos), the first creation of God, was begotten without intercourse—Jesus Christ, our Master—was crucified, died, rose again, and ascended into heaven, we present nothing new compared to what you call the Sons of Zeus. You know how many sons the esteemed writers attribute to Zeus: Hermes, the Word (Logos), who was the interpreter and teacher of all, and Asclepius, who was a healer, struck by a bolt from his father and ascended into heaven, among many others.### Hermes: The Messenger of God

Even if Jesus, the Son of God, were just an ordinary man, his wisdom alone makes him deserving of the title "Son of God." All writers refer to God as the "Father of men and gods." If we also claim that Jesus was uniquely begotten by God as the Word (Logos) of God, we align with your belief in Hermes as the Word who brings messages from God.

### Sons of God in Hellenistic Theology

It's notable that Justin lists Sons of God like Dionysus and Hercules alongside Hermes and Asclepius. When he revisits the topic, he again highlights Hermes, showing that Hermes was a significant comparison in the Hellenistic theological world, especially under the concept of the Logos. The mention of Asclepius with Hermes suggests they were closely linked in Justin's mind, though this connection is too vague for any firm conclusions about Asclepius’ role in the Trismegistic literature of Justin's time. Justin seems to have limited firsthand knowledge, as he incorrectly includes the Greek myth of Asclepius being struck by a thunderbolt, which doesn't fit with the Hellenistic view of Asclepius as Hermes' disciple.

### An Unverifiable Quotation

Chambers adds a passage from "II. Apologia, vi."—written about four or five years after the first. It states, "To the Father of all, no name can be given because He is uncreated. Any name given implies the existence of someone older who gives the name.""Father," "God," "Creator," "Lord," and "Master" are not names but titles that come from His blessings and works. This idea is similar to one found in a Hermetic text, but there is no direct evidence in Justin's writings to confirm it as a quotation. For a similar concept in Hermetic writings, see Corpus Hermeticum, Book V, section 10, and Lactantius, Divine Institutes, Book I, section 6.

Footnotes:

1. The Exhortation is considered by most to be pseudepigraphic, but some believe it to be Justin's earliest work, possibly dating around 130 A.D.; the First Apology is generally dated to 148 A.D.
2. Referring to the reading peri eaytou (Otto, n. 13), as adopted in R. 138.
3. This passage is also quoted by Lactantius, Divine Institutes, Epitome, section 4; Cyril of Alexandria, Against Julian, Book I, section 31; and Stobaeus, Florilegium, section 80.

For the connection between Ammon and Hermes, it is similar to that between King Thamus-Ammon and the god of invention, Theuth-Hermes. Thamus-Ammon was a philosopher-king who judged Theuth’s inventions and discoveries, not always favorably. This story is mentioned by Plato in Phaedrus, section 274 C.

III. CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA

1. Protrepticus, ii. 29; Dindorf (G.), i. 29, (Oxford, 1869)--(24 P., 8 S.). MANY HERMESES AND ASCLEPIUSES

After mentioning the three Zeuses, five Athenas, and countless Apollos from popular tradition, Clement continues:

"But what if I mention the many Asclepiuses, the Hermeses, or the Hephaestuses of mythology?" Clement lived at the heart of Hellenistic theology. His grouping of Asclepius, Hermes, and Hephaestus (the demiurgic Ptah whose tradition was included in the Poemandres doctrine) shows that these names were closely linked in his mind, indicating his familiarity with the Trismegistic literature. This is confirmed by the following passage.

2. Stromateis, I. xxi. 134; Dindorf, ii. 108 (399 P., 144 S.). THE APOTHEOSIS OF HERMES AND ASCLEPIUS

Among those who once lived as men in Egypt but have been made gods by human belief are Hermes of Thebes and Asclepius of Memphis. (We can add what Clement tells us about the "Books of Hermes," describing an Egyptian sacred procession from the last quarter of the second century:)

3. Ibid., VI. iv. 35; Dindorf, iii. 156, 157. THE BOOKS OF HERMES

First comes the "Singer" carrying one of the symbols of music.This priest, they tell us, must master two of the "Books of Hermes." One book contains hymns in honor of the gods, and the other contains reflections on royal life. After the "Singer" comes the "Time-watcher," who carries symbols related to astronomy, such as a sundial and a phoenix. He must be well-versed in the four books of Hermes that cover the stars. The first book deals with the arrangement of the fixed stars, the next two address the conjunctions and variations of the light of the Sun and Moon, and the last one covers the risings of the stars.

Next is the "Scribe of the Mysteries," who has wings on his head and carries a book and a ruler in each hand, along with ink and a reed pen for writing. He must know the sacred characters and the books on cosmography, geography, the constitution of the Sun and Moon, the five planets, the survey of Egypt, the chart of the Nile, the list of temple appurtenances, the lands consecrated to them, measurements, and items used in sacred rites.

Following him is the "Overseer of the Ceremonies," who carries the cubit of justice and the libation cup as his symbols. He must know all the books related to the training of public cult conductors and the books known as the victim-sealing books. There are ten of these books, which detail the worship of the gods and the contents of the Egyptian cult. They cover sacrifice, first-fruits, hymns, prayers, processions, feasts, and similar topics.After all these come the "Prophet," holding a water-vase to his chest for everyone to see, followed by those carrying the bread for distribution. The "Prophet," as the head of the temple, memorizes the ten books known as "hieratic," which cover Laws, Gods, and the entire Discipline of the Priests. The "Prophet" also oversees the distribution of the temple revenues.

There are forty-two essential books for Hermes. Thirty-six of these books, which encompass the full wisdom of the Egyptians, are memorized by the previously mentioned priests. The remaining six books are learned by the "Shrine-bearers" and are medical texts dealing with the Constitution of the Body, Diseases, Instruments, Drugs, Eyes, and the Maladies of Women.

This passage from Clement provides a general catalogue of the Egyptian priestly library and insights into the Greek translations and adaptations in our Trismegistic writings. These writings fit well within this framework, especially the oldest "Poemandres" type, aligning with the content of the hieratic books. Although Clement did not list the titles, these hieratic books were evidently important and managed by the "Prophet," the high priests who directed the prophetic discipline discussed in the "Poemandres" treatises.The usual translation of "Regulations" seems unsatisfactory to me. A word like "Praise" (perhaps read as *eylogismon*) seems more appropriate, as seen in the title of C. H., (xviii.), "The Encomium of Kings." 

The phrase *tun aplanun fainomenun astrun* means "the unwavering star." The term *kanona* refers to a hollow wooden case shaped like a ruler. 

The *stoliste's*, also called *ierostolos*, is usually translated as the "keeper of the vestments" or "the one in charge of the wardrobe." However, this meaning doesn't fit the content of the books assigned to him. He was clearly the organizer of ceremonies, especially processions.

*Mosxosfragistika* literally means books about the art of selecting and "sealing calves" for sacrifice. Initially, this referred to choosing the sacred Apis bull-calf, believed to be a reincarnation of a god, a relic of ancient magic rites kept in Egyptian public worship. Later, its meaning became more general, as seen in the nature of the books in this category. Boulage, in his "Mysteres d'Isis" (Paris, 1820, p. 21), states that "the seal of the priests marking the victims was a man kneeling with his hands bound behind his back and a sword pointed at his throat, symbolizing that the neophyte agreed to die by the sword if he revealed any secrets." He derived this from Plutarch's *De Is. et Os.*, xxxi. 3.

*Oi ten ekpempsin tun artun bastazontes* means "those carrying out the bread." The "Prophet" belonged to the high priest grade and had practical knowledge of the inner way.As the Nile's flood irrigated fields and produced grain for bread, feeding Egypt, so did the flow of Gnosis from the infinite space pour into the Hierophant. He, in turn, became like Father Nile for his disciples, the priests, who distributed the bread of knowledge to the people. This symbolism is reminiscent of the bread and water used by early Christian ascetics, who rejected wine. Even the General Church in its older traditions continues to sprinkle people with water and distribute bread.

This suggests that there were other forms of knowledge, optional or reserved for a select few. There might have been forty-nine in total. The priesthood, known as the pastophoroi, carried the pastos, symbolizing the shrine or casket of the soul, essentially the human body. These priests were the body's healers, with higher ranks presumably healing the soul. There seems to be a copying error in the text. Regarding the hieroglyphic inscription at Edfu, believed by Jomasd to reference the titles of these forty-two books, see Parthey's "Uber Isis und Osiris," p. 255.

IV. TERTULLIAN

i. Against the Valentinians, xv.; Oehler, ii. 402 (Leipzig, 1844). HERMES THE MASTER OF ALL PHYSICS

Writing sarcastically about the Gnostic Sophia-myth, Tertullian exclaims:

Well, let the Pythagoreans, the Stoics, and even Plato learn where matter comes from.The Pythagoreans and others believed that the world was formed from something that could not be created or destroyed. Even the renowned Hermes Trismegistus, the master of all physics, could not fully explain this mystery. Hermes, along with Hellenistic theology, taught that matter originates from the One God. Tertullian reserves his final critique for this school, which was evidently held in the highest regard, led by the "famous Thrice-greatest Hermes."

In "De Anima," Tertullian criticizes philosophers, stating that philosophy mistakenly believes it has drawn from what philosophers consider "sacred" scriptures. Antiquity thought most authors were gods, not just inspired by them—such as the Egyptian Hermes, who had a particular influence on Plato. Tertullian places Hermes at the top of the list, suggesting that Hermes belongs to a more ancient era than Pythagoras and Plato, with Plato depending on Hermes, not the other way around. Hermes was considered a god and had his own "sacred scriptures."

Regarding the ancient doctrine mentioned by Plato about the migration of souls—how they move from one place to another, live, die, and are reborn—some attribute this teaching to Pythagoras, while Albinus believes it might be a divine pronouncement from the Egyptian Hermes.**HERMES ON REINCARNATION**

(Tertullian argues ironically against the belief in reincarnation:)

Even if souls remain unchanged until judgment is passed upon them, a point noted by the Egyptian Hermes, who says that the soul, upon leaving the body, does not merge back into the universe's soul but stays individualized:

**FRAGMENT I.** This is so the soul can give an account to the Father for what it did in the body. Although this exact quote isn't found in the existing Hermetic literature, it seems genuine. Oehler refers to "The Key," chapter 10, verse 7, but that passage only generally discusses reincarnation. A better comparison is found in "The Perfect Sermon," chapter 28, verse 1: "When the soul departs from the body, then judgment and the weighing of its merits pass into the power of its highest daimon." This passage has stronger traces of the original Egyptian idea than the one Tertullian quoted.

**GOD IS BEYOND ALL UNDERSTANDING**

Thrice-Greatest Hermes speaks of the One God and acknowledges Him as beyond all understanding and evaluation. This likely refers to the most quoted sentence of Hermes. See Justin Martyr for additional references.Chambers (p. 140) includes a passage from Eusebius (c. 325 A.D.) after mentioning Cyprian. He claims that Eusebius quotes directly from the 'Poemandres' of Hermes, although Eusebius likely confuses Hermes with the Shepherd of Hermas. In his work (Hist. Ecc., v. 8), Eusebius quotes Irenaeus (iv. 20, 2), who in turn quotes The Shepherd of Hermas (Mand., i.) word for word. This particular sentence is well-known in early Christian writings. For more examples of such quotations by early church fathers, refer to Gebhardt and Harnack's text (Leipzig, 1897), p. 70. This kind of precise wording is rare in other Trismegistic texts, but the underlying idea is central to Trismegistic theology.

VII. LACTANTIUS

i. Divinae Institutiones, i. 6, 1; Brandt, p. 18; Fritzsche, i. 13.### Thoth-Hermes and His Books on Gnosis

Let's now consider divine testimonies. First, I'll present evidence that is almost divine due to its great age and because the person I'm mentioning was taken from humanity back to the gods. In Cicero's work, Caius Cotta, the Pontifex, debates against the Stoics about beliefs and the various opinions regarding the gods. To invoke doubt, as was the custom of the Academics, he mentions that there were five Hermeses. After listing four of them, he adds that the fifth Hermes killed Argus and fled to Egypt, where he taught the Egyptians laws and writing. The Egyptians call him Thoth, and their first month (September) is named after him. He also founded a city still known today as Hermopolis. The people of Pheneus worship him as a god. Although he was a man, his ancient wisdom and mastery of many sciences earned him the title "Thrice-greatest." He wrote many books on the Gnosis of divine matters, in which he praises the greatness of the Supreme and Only God, calling Him God and Father, just as we do. He also stated that God's true name cannot be known because, being one, He does not need a name. His words are:

**Fragment II:** But God is one; and He who is one does not need a name, for He is beyond all names.### The Historical Origins of the Hermetic Tradition

For Lactantius, Hermes was a very ancient figure who descended from heaven and returned there. When Firmianus attempts to trace the historical origins of the Hermetic tradition, he, like many ancient writers, relies on a complex yet interesting myth. This myth, designed to flatter its Greek creators, suggests that a Greek god, whose cult was closely tied to an ancient mystery tradition, was the source of Egyptian wisdom. This is typical of many ancient cultures who claimed their traditions were the oldest and the best.

Lactantius, however, lacks historical knowledge of the tradition he holds in high regard. His references to the Latinized name Thoth and Hermopolis only highlight his limited understanding. What Lactantius does know is a large body of Greek literature and its general themes. The sentence he quotes does not appear verbatim in any existing Trismegistic texts.

### Uranus, Cronus, and Hermes: Masters of Perfect Science

It appears that Cronus was not born from Heaven (which is impossible) but from a man named Uranus. Trismegistus supports this, stating that very few people possessed perfect knowledge, including Uranus, Cronus, and Hermes, his relatives.

### Divine Providence

The world was created by Divine Providence, a concept also preached by Thrice-greatest (Hermes Trismegistus).ON MORTAL AND IMMORTAL SIGHT

God's works can be seen by our eyes, but how He made them cannot even be understood by our minds. As Hermes says:

Mortal beings cannot approach the Immortal, nor the temporary reach the Eternal, nor the corruptible comprehend the Incorruptible.

Therefore, earthly beings do not have the capacity to see heavenly things, as they are confined within their bodies like in a prison. If they were freed, they would be able to see everything.

The first part of this citation (which Lactantius gives in Latin) shares the same idea as a sentence in Fragment IV, a frequently quoted source that Stobaeus excerpted from "The Sermon to Tat." It might be thought that this was simply a paraphrase by Lactantius, or a quote from memory, with the second sentence being his own writing. However, the second sentence is so characteristic of Trismegistic thought that it seems genuine.

MAN MADE AFTER THE IMAGE OF GOD

The creation of the truly living man from clay is the work of God. Hermes also preserves this tradition. He not only states that man was made by God in the Image of God but also attempts to explain the skill with which each part of the human body is formed. Every part is perfectly suited for its function and also designed for beauty.

Man being made in the Image of God is a fundamental doctrine of the Trismegistic tradition. For example, in P.S.A., it is mentioned that man is the "essential" being, which the Greeks call the "form of the Divine Similitude."3. Giving the greatest thanks to God and honoring His image, knowing that man is also God's image, the second one. There are two images of God: the Cosmos and man.

Empedocles and others identified four elements: fire, air, water, and earth. They might have followed Trismegistus, who said that our bodies are made of these four elements by God. "For our bodies have something of fire, air, water, and earth, but they are not entirely fire, air, water, or earth." This idea of the elements is common in ancient physics, so we can dismiss Lactantius's naive speculation, who believed he had the exact words of the theory's first inventor. He translated into Latin the same text that Stobaeus preserved in an excerpt from "The Sermons to Tat."

There are two classes of daimons: celestial and terrestrial. The terrestrial ones are impure spirits responsible for evils, with Diabolus as their chief. Trismegistus calls him the "Daimon-chief."

Hermes asserts that those who have known God are safe from evil daimons and are not bound by Fate. He says:

The only means of protection is piety. Neither an evil daimon nor Fate rules over a pious person. God saves the pious from every ill. The greatest good in humanity is piety. He explains piety by saying:

"Devotion is God-Knowledge."Asclepius, a follower of Trismegistus, explained the same idea in more detail in his "Perfect Sermon" written to the King. Both assert that demons are the enemies of humans, which is why Trismegistus calls them "evil angels." He understood that these beings, originally celestial, had become corrupted and earthly. This passage is given in Greek and is also quoted, with many annotations, by Cyril in his work "Contra Julianum" (iv. 130). It closely matches a sentence in another text: "The righteous man finds his defense in serving God and deep piety. For God guards such men from every evil."

We know that Lactantius had access to the Greek version of this "Perfect Sermon," and our Latin translation is very rhetorical and paraphrased. The only issue is that Lactantius' quotation ends with: "The one and only good found in mankind is piety," which does not appear in the Latin translation. However, Firmianus immediately mentions a "Perfect Sermon" written by Asclepius and addressed to the King. Thus, our fragment is likely from the lost ending of C. H., xvi.

Hermes, in the book titled the "Perfect Sermon," says:

The Lord and Master of all things (whom we customarily call God), after creating the second God, the Visible and Sensible one, regarded Him as fair and filled with all good things. He marveled at Him and loved Him as His Son.Lactantius quotes from the lost Greek original of "The Perfect Sermon," chapter 8, section 1. This allows us to verify the old Latin translation we have. The Latin version is quite free and often rhetorical; it adds phrases and even changes the original text. For example, in the last clause, it says: "He fell in love with him as being part of His Divinity." It's possible the translator had a different text since there might have been several versions of "The Perfect Sermon."

Lactantius (referring to the Son of God and linking Him to the pre-existent Wisdom in Proverbs 8:22) says that Trismegistus called Him the "Demiurge of God."

Even when the world ends, God's Name cannot be spoken by humans, as Hermes teaches:

But the cause of this cause is the Divine Good's goodwill, which first brought forth the God whose Name cannot be spoken by humans.

There is a Word of wisdom that no tongue can tell—a Holy Word about the only Lord of all, the God before all thought—whom no human can fully describe.

Hermes also believed that:

"He is His own father and His own mother."### The Power and Greatness of the Word

Trismegistus, who seems to have discovered almost all truths, often talks about the power and greatness of the Word (Logos). As shown in the above quote, he describes the Word as Ineffable and Holy, stating that its expression goes beyond human capability.

### The Fatherless and Motherless

God, the Father, and the Source and Principle of all things, is described by Trismegistus as "fatherless" and "motherless" because He has no parents and is not born from anyone.

### Piety as the Knowledge of God

Trismegistus has rightly said that "piety is nothing else than the knowledge of God," as we have mentioned before.

### The Only Way to Worship God

Regarding justice, Trismegistus, who aligns with the prophets on the topic of sacrifice, said:

"To this Word (Logos), my son, give your adoration and homage. There is only one way to worship God: do not be bad." Lactantius translates this literally from a sermon titled "About the Common Mind to Tat." However, Hermes in this context was not specifically writing about justice.

### The Worthiest Sacrifice to God

In the "Perfect Sermon," when Asclepius asked his son if it would be pleasing to offer incense and other perfumes to God during their holy rites, Hermes exclaimed:

FRAGMENT VIII.No, no; speak more kindly, my dear Asclepius! It is very disrespectful to think such things about the One and Only Good. These ideas are not suitable for Him. He is full of everything that exists and needs nothing. Let us worship by giving our thanks. The best sacrifice we can offer Him is our blessings, and blessings alone.

Here is a passage to compare from P.S.A., xli. 2 (p. 61, 16, Goldb.). We can control the old Latin translator, but not as precisely as before, because Lactantius also translated the Greek text into Latin. From other examples of Lactantius' translations of Hermes, and his close reproduction of the typical wording of the Trismegistic texts, we can be confident that the Old Latin translation is free, paraphrased, and rhetorical, as we have noted. 

Hermes knew that man was made by God and in the Image of God.

CONTEMPLATION

Lactantius notes that man is the only creature with an upright body and a face directed towards heaven, looking towards his Maker. Hermes has rightly called this "looking" contemplation.

THE DUAL NATURE OF MAN

Hermes explains that man was made by God from two natures, the immortal and the mortal. He created man as one being that is both somehow immortal and somehow mortal. This man was placed between the divine and the mortal, so that by observing all, he might marvel at all.### Wonder: The Beginning of Philosophy

The idea of "wonder" was common in Hellenistic philosophical circles and traces back to Plato's saying: "There is no other beginning of Philosophy than wonder." This concept is similar to a recently discovered saying of Jesus from the Oxyrhynchus papyri: "Let him who seeks continue until he finds; when he finds, he will wonder, and in his wonder, he will reign, and in his reigning, he will find rest."

Wonder is the beginning of knowledge. It makes a person master of themselves and thus gives them control over their destiny, bringing peace. The translation of "basileusei" by Grenfell and Hunt as "reach the kingdom" seems unjustified. Lactantius quotes the Greek text of P. S. A., viii. 3, allowing us to compare it with the Old Latin version. The Church Father's version is more reliable, echoing familiar Hermetic expressions, providing insight into the methods of the rhetorical and sometimes altered Latin Version.

### The Cosmic Restoration

Hermes clearly states the [destruction of the world]. In the book titled "The Perfect Sermon," after listing various evils, he says:

FRAGMENT X: "When these things happen, as I have said, Asclepius, then our Lord and Father, the God and Creator of the First and One God, will look upon what has been done. He will enforce His Will, which is the Good, against disorder. He will correct errors and cleanse the bad, either by washing it away with floods, burning it away with fire, or expelling it through war and famine. Then, He will restore His Cosmos to its former state, achieving its Restoration."**About Hermes and His Teachings on God**

Hermes, known as Thrice-greatest due to his virtue and knowledge in many arts, predates the philosophers in the antiquity of his teachings and is worshipped as a god by the Egyptians. He praises the greatness of the One and Only God, calling Him God and Father. Hermes states that this God has no name because He does not need one, as He is the only one in existence. Furthermore, God has no parents, as He exists from and by Himself.

In a letter to his son Tat, Hermes begins by saying:

"Understanding God is difficult, and speaking of Him is impossible, even for those who can comprehend Him, because the perfect cannot be understood by the imperfect, nor the invisible by the visible."

Regarding creation, Hermes says that through the Logos as Demiurge, God the Father designed the beautiful and wondrous world. Plato, too, speaks of the first and second God, not just as a philosopher but perhaps as a prophet, possibly following Hermes Trismegistus.Cicero has Cotta support the arguments of this school both in this text and in "De Oratore."

According to ancient myths, Argos was all-seeing (panoptes), with countless eyes or, in one version, an eye on top of his head. Like Hercules, he had superhuman strength, and many stories highlight his feats. In the Io legends, Hera made Argos the guardian of a cow that Zeus had transformed his lover into. Zeus sent Hermes to rescue his beloved. Hermes lulled Argos to sleep using his syrinx (a pipe of seven reeds) or his caduceus, then either stoned him or cut off his head. Refer to "Reseller's Ausfuhr. Lex. d. griech. u. rom. Myth.," under "Argos." Interestingly, some manuscripts read "argentum" instead of "Argum," indicating a Medieval Alchemical influence. See note 4 in "Ciceronis Opera Philosophica," volume ii. (London, 1830).

Pheneus was a town in Arcadia, known for ancient mysteries. Hermas is taken by the "Shepherd" in spirit to a mountain in Arcadia (see "Shepherd of Hermas," Sim. ix. 1). Cicero starts his description of the fifth Hermes with this statement, which Lactantius misplaced. Pausanias (viii. 14, 6) notes that Pheneus was considered an ancient city, primarily worshipping Hermes. This worship included ancient mystery traditions. Pausanias (ibid., 15, 1) mentions:

"The Pheneatians also have a sanctuary of Demeter, called Eleusinian, where they celebrate mysteries similar to those at Eleusis. Next to the sanctuary of the Eleusinian goddess is the Petroma, two large stones fitted together."Every second year, during the celebration of the Greater Mysteries, they open these stones and take out certain writings related to the mysteries. They read these writings to the initiated and then put them back in place the same night. I also know that on the most important matters, many of the Pheneatians swear by the Petroma.

See note 5 to the text of Cicero cited above. Cf. R. 117, note 2. ^234:2 He probably took this from P. S.

It is notable that Lactantius places Trismegistus with the Sibylline Oracles and Prophets, and then discusses philosophers like Pythagoreans and Platonists. He repeats this triple combination in iv. 6. ^235:3 Propinquare. L. glosses this as "come close to and follow with intelligence." ^235:4 Cf. Fragment apud Cyril, C. I., i.

See also Cyril, Contra Julianum, Book IV (Volume VI, 130 E, Aub.). 

For the same idea, see C.H. Book XII (XIII), Chapter 9. 

The phrase "eusebeia gnosis esti tou theou," which Lactantius translates into Latin in another passage (Book V, Chapter 14) as "Pietas autem nihil aliud est quam dei notio," is given in C.H. Book IX (X), Chapter 4 as "eusebeia de esti theou gnosis" (where Parthey notes no variations in manuscripts). 

The words "aggelous ponerous" do not appear in our existing Greek texts; but the Latin translation of P. S. A., Chapter XXV, 4, preserves it as "nocentes angeli."

Lactantius also partially translates this passage in his Epitome, Chapter 42 (Fritzsche, Volume II, Page 140). 

The exact phrase "demiourgon tou" does not appear in our existing texts, but the idea is common in Trismegistic doctrine. See especially P. S. A., Chapter XXVI: "The Demiurge of the first and the one God," and Lactantius, ibid., Book VII, Chapter 18, 4: "God of first might, and Guider of the one God." See also C.H.

### VIII. Augustine

**i. De Civitate Dei, xxiii.; Hoffmann (E.), i. 392 (Vienna, 1899-1900).**

**Three Quotations from the Old Latin Version of the "Perfect Sermon"**

Augustine is arguing against the views of Apuleius (first half of the second century) regarding the worship of "daimones." In doing so, he introduces a lengthy discussion on the doctrine of "Egyptian Hermes, whom they call Thrice-greatest," about image-worship, or the consecrated and "ensouled" statues of the gods. During his remarks, the Bishop of Hippo extensively quotes from a current Latin version of "The Perfect Sermon" or "Asclepius" (though he does not give it a title himself), which is clearly the same text that has survived to this day. The text matches ours exactly, with only minor variations.

**Page 250**

First, Augustine quotes from *P.S.A.*, xxiii. 3, xxiv. 2. He interprets this "prophecy" of the fall of the Egyptian religion as a reference to the triumph of Christianity and mocks Hermes for mourning so shamelessly and knowing so imprudently. 

**ii. Ibid., xxiv.; Hoffmann, i. 396.**
In his next chapter, the Bishop of Hippo begins with a quotation from *P.S.A.*, xxxvii. 1, 2, on the same topic, and goes on to scornfully critique the statements of the Trismegistic writer.

**iii. Ibid., xxvi.; Hoffmann, i. 402.**
After quoting from *P.S.A.*, xxiv.In section 3, Hermes states that the pure temples of Egypt will be defiled by tombs and corpses. Augustine argues that the gods of Egypt are merely deceased men, supporting his claim with a reference to P. S. A., xxxvii. 3, 4.

IX. CYRIL OF ALEXANDRIA [*1]

i. Against Julian, i. 30; Migne, col. 548 A. [*2]

CYRIL'S COLLECTION OF FIFTEEN BOOKS

(Cyril, after asserting that Pythagoras and Plato gained their wisdom from Egypt and learned about Moses there, continues:)

I believe the Egyptian Hermes also deserves mention—he who, they say, is called Thrice-Greatest due to the respect given to him by his peers, and some believe, in comparison to Hermes, the mythological son of Zeus and Maia. This Egyptian Hermes, even though he was an initiator into mysteries and devoted to idol shrines, is found to have understood some of Moses' teachings, albeit not completely accurately and without dispute, yet partially.

Hermes himself benefited from Moses, and this is acknowledged in his writings by the editor in Athens who compiled the fifteen books called "Hermaica." The editor writes about Hermes in the first book, narrating through the voice of a priest of the sacred rituals:

"And so, in order that we may approach matters of a similar nature..."Have you not heard that our Hermes divided all of Egypt into sections, measuring the land with a chain? He dug canals for irrigation, created administrative regions called nomes, and named the lands accordingly. He also established contracts, recorded the stars' risings, and identified the best times to harvest plants. Beyond this, he discovered and passed down knowledge of numbers, calculations, geometry, astronomy, astrology, music, and grammar.

This collection of fifteen books is the source of Cyril's information. He quotes from the introduction, which was supposedly written by an Egyptian priest. However, Cyril believes it was written in Athens, likely by a Greek editor.

Thrice-greatest Hermes says:

If there is an incorporeal eye, let it leave the body to see the Beautiful. Let it soar, seeking to view not forms or bodies, but the Creator of all these — the Quiet and Serene, the Stable and Changeless One, the Self, the All, the One, the Self within self, the Like to Self alone, which is neither like others nor unlike itself, and yet again Himself.

Though Cyril merges this passage with four paragraphs from Stobaeus, I am convinced that the Archbishop of Alexandria got it from the same "Sermon to Tat" as the Anthologist.### THE HEAVENLY WORD PROCEEDING FORTH

Thrice-great Hermes speaks about God in this way:

### FRAGMENT XII

His Word (Logos) went forth, perfect in every way, fertile, and creative within fertile Nature. When it touched fertile Water, it made the Water pregnant.

### THE PYRAMID 

Hermes also states:

### FRAGMENT XIII

The Pyramid is beneath both Nature and the Intellectual World. Above it is the ruling Creator-Word of the Lord of all. This Creator-Word, being the First Power after God, is uncreated and infinite. It emanated from God and sits above, ruling over everything created through it. It is the First-born of All-perfection, the perfect, fertile, and true Son.

### THE NATURE OF GOD'S INTELLECTUAL WORD

Hermes, when questioned by a temple follower in Egypt, says:

### FRAGMENT XIV

Why, O most mighty Good Daimon, was he called by this name by the Lord of all? Hermes replies:

I have explained this before, but you did not understand. The nature of His Intellectual Word (Logos) is productive and creative. It is like His Power of giving birth, His Nature, or His Mode of being. Call it what you will, but remember this: He is Perfect in the Perfect and creates all perfect good things. Because of this nature, He is rightly named so.

### THE WORD OF THE CREATOR

In the First Sermon of the "Expository Sermons to Tat," Hermes speaks about God:

### FRAGMENT XV

[Text continues...]The Creator's Word (Logos), my son, goes beyond all vision. He moves by Himself, cannot be increased or diminished, and is self-sufficient. He is unique, equal to Himself, perfect in stability and order, as He is the One, next to the unknowable God. The first two fragments (xi. and xii.) seem to come from the same sermon, similar to the first part of the "Shepherd of Men" treatise. It appears to be a discourse to Tat, likely from "The Expository Sermons" (p. 257).

The third fragment (xiii.) is more Egyptian in style, part of the Agathodaimon literature, where Hermes, as the Good Spirit, teaches about the Mystery-god Osiris.

The last fragment (xv.) is so similar to fragment xi., as noted by Cyril (i. 31), that it seems likely both came from the same source. If so, we can reconstruct part of "The First Sermon of the Expository Sermons to Tat," the beginning of which is also mentioned by Stobaeus, Ex. ii., under the heading "The Book to Tat," while he titles other excerpts "From the [pl.] to Tat."

v. Ibid., ii. 35; Migne, col. 556 A. MIND OF MIND

Hermes also says in the Third Sermon to Asclepius:

FRAGMENT XVI. These mysteries cannot be explained to those uninitiated in the sacred rites. But you, listen with the ears of your mind! There was One Intellectual Light alone, surpassing even Intellectual Light. He is forever the Mind of mind who makes that Light shine (p. 258).

There was no other, only His Oneness alone. Forever in Himself, He encompasses all in His own Mind, His Light, and Spirit.

HE IS ALL

And after some other things he says:

FRAGMENT XVII.Without Him, neither god, angel, demon, nor any other being can exist. He is the Lord of all, their Father, God, Source, Life, Power, Light, Mind, and Spirit. Everything exists in Him and for His sake.

### Concerning Spirit

In the Third Sermon to Asclepius, in response to a question about the Divine Spirit, Hermes says:

"If the Lord of all had not intended for me to reveal this, you would not be filled with such great love to ask me about it. Now listen to the rest of the discourse. All things need this Spirit, as it raises, nourishes, and gives life to everything according to its own degree. Eventually, it returns them to their holy source, assisting the spirit and continually giving life to all, as the one productive force."

### The "To Asclepius" of Cyril's Corpus

From Cyril's writings, we understand that besides "The Expository Sermons to Tat," he also had a collection of "Sermons to Asclepius," of which there were at least three. "The Perfect Sermon" might have been part of this collection, as its style is similar to these fragments in Cyril's work. In the Third Sermon of Cyril's collection, Hermes addresses multiple listeners, using the plural form. In "P. S. A., i. 2," Hermes addresses Asclepius, Tat, and Ammon. Hermes also states: "It is not possible to reveal such mysteries to those who are not initiated in the sacred rites"; similarly, in "P. S. A., i. 2," Hermes declares: "It is impious to share a document full of divine grandeur with the general public."The concept of divine majesty, or the grandeur of divinity, is the same as the Spirit, which Cyril describes as the "Divine supremacy and power," referring to Hermes. In the Third Sermon, Hermes makes a notable comment that the Love (eros) for Gnosis, which motivates the disciples, is inspired by God's Providence or Foresight—that is, by His Spirit. P. S. A., i. 28, concludes with the words: "To them, in respectful silence, their souls and minds hanging on Hermes' words, thus Divine Love (eros) began to speak." The way of presenting the message is the same in both Sermons, so we can assume they belong to the same collection. See also, ii. 52; Migne, col. 580 B. FROM "THE MIND"

I will add what Thrice-greatest Hermes wrote "To his own Mind,"—since that is the title of the Book. (Cyril then quotes, with slight verbal variations, the last question and answer in C. H., xi. (xii.) 22.) In our collection, the treatise is not written by Hermes to the Mind but is presented as a revelation from "The Mind to Hermes," and is titled accordingly. Cyril seems to have been mistaken. It may be that in the copy Cyril had, the title was simply: "The Mind." See also, ii. 55; Migne, col. 586 D.

OSIRIS AND THRICE-GREATEST AGATHODAIMON

I recall the words of Hermes the Thrice-greatest in "The Asclepius," where he says:

FRAGMENT XIX. Osiris asked: How, then, O Thrice-greatest, Good Spirit, did the Earth come to appear in its entirety? The Great Good Spirit replied:

By gradual drying up, as I have said; and when the many Waters were commanded to recede, the Earth appeared, muddy and shaking. Then, when the Sun shone continuously and dried it up, the Earth became compact, surrounded by Water."LET THERE BE EARTH"

In another passage, it says:

FRAGMENT XX. The Creator and Ruler of all said: Let there be Earth, and let the Sky appear! And immediately, the Earth, the start of all creation, came into being.

THE CREATION OF THE SUN

Regarding the Earth, that's all. Concerning the Sun, it states:

FRAGMENT XXI. Osiris asked: O Thrice-Greatest, Good Spirit, where did this great one come from? Would you, Osiris, like us to tell you the origin of the Sun? It came from the foresight of the Lord of all; the Sun's birth comes from the Lord of all, through His Creative Holy Word.

"LET THE SUN BE!" Similarly, in the "First Expository Sermon to Tat," it says:

FRAGMENT XXII. Immediately, the Lord of all spoke to His own Holy and Intelligible Creative Word (Logos): Let the Sun be! And immediately, with His word (logos), the Fire that naturally rises upward—pure Fire that gives the most light, has the most energy, and is the most fertile—was embraced by Nature with her own Spirit and lifted up out of the Water.

(After referring to Genesis 1:6: "And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters," Cyril continues:)

THE FIRMAMENT

Moreover, the Hermes who is with them, Thrice-Greatest, mentions the firmament again. He describes God as saying to His creations:

FRAGMENT XXIII. I will surround you with this Necessity, you who disobey me, which has been imposed on you as a Command through My own Word (Logos); for you have this as Law. This quote is likely from the same source as the previous passage—the "First Expository Sermon to Tat."The idea and setting should be compared with the parallel in the K. K. Excerpt (Stobaeus, Physical Extracts, xli. 44; Gaisford, p. 408): "O Souls, Love and Necessity shall be your lords, they who are lords and marshals after me of all,"--where the phrase "after me" (met' eme) might support the translation "up to me" mentioned in the previous note as more accurate. viii. Ibid., ii. 64; Migne, col. 598 D.

FROM THE "TO ASCLEPIUS"

Hermes, known as Thrice-greatest, writes to Asclepius about the nature of the universe:

(Here follows a slightly different version of the text from Corpus Hermeticum, xiv. (xv.) 6, 7, beginning: "If, then, all things have been admitted to be two.") [p. 265]

A few lines later, he continues passionately with a compelling argument, saying:

(This includes sections 8 and 9 of the same sermon, except the third sentence, and section 10, excluding the last sentence.) [*1]

The same treatise must have been available to Cyril in the form of a letter titled, "Unto Asclepius good health of soul!" --for the Archbishop mentions that Hermes "writes thus to Asclepius." [*2]

ix. Ibid., iv. 130; Migne, col. 702. THE SOLE PROTECTION

(After quoting Porphyry, who warns against participating in blood-rites due to contamination by evil spirits, Cyril continues:)

Their Thrice-greatest Hermes appears to share this view as well; he writes in the [sermon] "To Asclepius," about the unholy spirits we should guard against and avoid as quickly as possible:

"The sole protection--and this we must have--is piety. For neither evil spirit, nor Fate, can ever overcome or dominate a pious, pure, and holy man. For God saves the truly pious man from every evil." [*3]

[p. 266]

x. Ibid., viii.**THE SUPREME ARTIST**

Furthermore, their Thrice-great Hermes has made a statement about God, the Supreme Artist of all things:

**FRAGMENT XXIV.** In his perfect wisdom, He established both Order and its opposite, so that intellectual things, being older and superior, might govern and hold the highest place, while sensible things, being secondary, would be subject to them. Therefore, that which tends downward and is heavier than the intellectual contains within itself the wise Creative Word (Logos).

**UNREFERENCED QUOTATION** (Chambers mentions the following on page 154, "Cyrill. Contra Julian., citing Hermes," but without any reference, and it cannot be found in the text):

**FRAGMENT XXV.** If you understand that there is One and Only God, you will find nothing impossible; for He embodies all virtue.

Do not think that He exists within someone; do not say that He is outside of someone. He is without end; He is the end of all things. Nothing contains Him, for He contains everything within Himself. What is the difference, then, between the body and the Incorporeal, the created and the Uncreated, what is subject to necessity and what is Free, between earthly things and celestial things, the corruptible and the eternal? Is it not that the One exists freely while the others are subject to necessity?The phrase "y syntetheikus Athe'nesi," which Chambers incorrectly translates as "which he [Hermes] having composed for Athenians," is discussed by R. (p. 211, n. 1), who believes the editor was a Neoplatonist.

1. This refers to the soul.
2. This refers to ideas.
3. The term is masculine, not neuter, unlike all the preceding "self's." There is also a wordplay on "self" and "same" that cannot be translated into English.
4. This likely refers to the "First Sermon of the Expository [Sermons] to Tat" (see the commentary on the Stobaean Excerpt).
5. See also fragments xii., xiii., xv., xx., xxii., xxiii., xxiv. (?).

R. (p. 43) interprets this as "out of the mouth of God," but introducing this symbolism seems unnecessary.

The adjective "gonimos" (meaning "fecund") is used for both Logos and Physis (Nature); it could be translated as seedful and fruitful, or spermal and productive. See fragment xiii. Text reproduced by R. 43.

Compare Corpus Hermeticum, i. 8, 14, 15. This fragment is also quoted, but clearly reproduced from Cyril, by Suidas (q.v.).

This refers to the Logos.

This refers to the Pyramid, which in physics symbolizes fire. See fragment xxii.

"demioyrgon logon" – compare Lactantius, "Divine Institutes," iv. 6, 9.

The term "prokupsasa" implies "projected," likely with the idea of emanation. Compare the hymn: "O Heavenly Word proceeding forth, Yet leaving not the Father's side." Compare the "parekypsen" of Corpus Hermeticum, i. 14, and note.

Compare Corpus Hermeticum, i. 6, 9, 10; xiii. (xiv.) 3; xiv. (xv.) 3. For a slightly revised text, see R. 243, n. 3. Reitzenstein believes the image in the writer's mind was the pyramid or obelisk with the sun-disk on top.

"temenitun." The questioner was undoubtedly Osiris (see fragment xix. below). Cyril indicates that "Osiris" represented a grade of Egyptian priests. Compare R. 131.

This likely refers to the Logos.

This likely refers to "Soul" (Psyche).

This passage seems to discuss the identity of Soul and Logos.See R. 131 for the revised text and its reference to Plato’s Cratylus, 400 B, where the term "psyche" (soul) is explained through a wordplay with "physexe," meaning that which has nature or the power of production.

^256:2 Note the phrase "tun pros ton Tat diexodikun."

^257:1 Refer to Fragment xix, where Cyril (ii. 56) mentions that this type was found in the "Sermon to Asclepius," indicating it was included in the Asclepius-books collection he had.

^257:2 See also Fragments xi, xii, xiii, xx, xxii, xxiii, xxiv (?).

^257:3 Compare with K. K., 16.

^258:1 This refers to Light and Life. See C. H., i. 9: "God, the Mind, ... being Life and Light."

^258:2 Literally "outside of Him."

^258:3 For a more detailed explanation of the idea in this paragraph, see C. H., ii. (iii.) 14. Cyril believes these two Fragments refer to the Father, Son (Mind of mind and Light of light), and Holy Spirit (the Divine supremacy and power), which forms the basis of Suidas’ statement (s.v. "Hermes") that Trismegistus spoke about the Trinity.

^258:4 Or Providence (pronoia). R. (203, n. 2) suggests that only when an internal prompting allowed the master to expand the teaching could he do so. See also Appuleius, Metamorphoses, xi. 21-22; P. S. A., i.

^259:1 "Eryus toioutos" (such a guardian).

^259:2 Presumably causing their apparent death.

^259:3 This refers to the individual life-breath unless the reading "epikoyron pneumati" is incorrect. The Latin translator in Migne makes significant errors, as is often the case. See also C. H., x. (xi.) 13, Comment; P. S. A., vi. 4; Exx. iv. 2, xv. 2, xix. 3.

^260:1 This refers to the uninitiated, the "profanum vulgus."

^260:2 "Tractatus," presumably "logos" in the original Greek.

^260:3 See also P. S. A., xx. 2, xxi. 1, 3.

^261:1 Compare with R. 128, n. 1.

^261:2 Texts of quotations reproduced in R. 127, n. 1.

^261:3 From the quotations, it is clear that this was not the specific heading of the treatise Cyril quotes, which belongs to the Agathodaimon type.Cyril likely means that the treatise in his collection was included under the general title "The Asclepius." 

Agathos daimun.

The text has an untranslatable phrase "apo tou," where the missing part is probably "from the Lord of all."

A distinction is clearly made between the heavenly Water and earthly water. The text continues in Fragment 21 below.

See Corpus Hermeticum, Book 1, Section 18, Commentary.

This appears to be taken not from a different part of "To Asclepius," but from another sermon, likely the "First Expository Sermon to Tat," as seen by comparing its phrasing with Fragment 22. See also Fragments 11, 12, 13, 15, 22, 23, and 24.

This is evidently a direct continuation of Fragment 19 above. Compare R. 126, note 1, where the texts are reproduced.

See Fragment 13 below, concerning the pyramid.

Embraced the Fire.

Water-Earth refers to one element that had not yet separated, according to Corpus Hermeticum, Book 1, Section 5. For other likely quotes from the "First Expository Sermon to Tat," see Fragments 11, 12, 13, 15, 20, 23, and 24.

This refers to the philosophers.

"Tois ep' eme" literally means "against me," or possibly "up to me." Migne's Latin translator gives "qui in mea potestatis estis," and Chambers translates it as "those from me"; neither seems correct.

Cyril also twice omits the words "ignorance and jealousy" after "arrogance and impotence," and also the words "and yet the other things" in section 9.

Compare with Fragment 4, Commentary.

Compare with P. S. A., section 29. A comparison of this with Fragment 4, quoted by Lactantius (Book 2, Section 15), and the Commentary shows that Cyril has strengthened the original text with interpolations. Cyril's quote from Julian, where the Emperor refers to Hermes, is given under "Julian."

"Aristotexnou" is an epithet used by Pindar (Fragment 29) to describe Zeus.

Ataxian.**X.**

**SUIDAS**

Lexicon, s.v. Hermes the Thrice-Great; Im. Bekker (Berlin, 1854). HERMES SPEAKS OF THE TRINITY

Hermes the Thrice-Great was an Egyptian sage who lived before the time of Pharaoh. He is called Thrice-Great because he spoke of the Trinity, stating that within the Trinity there is one Godhead, as follows:

"Before Intellectual Light existed, there was Intellectual Light; there was the Mind of the mind, eternally giving Light. There was nothing else except the unity of this Mind and the all-embracing Spirit. Without this, there is no god, no angel, nor any other being. For He is Lord and Father, and the God of all; everything is beneath Him and within Him."

(The source of Suidas, or his editor, is clearly Cyril, C. J., i. 35 (Fragg. xvi., xvii.), from which a very distorted version is reproduced. The same statement and passage is also quoted by Cedrenus, John Malalas, and the author of the Chronicum Alexandrinum. See Bernhardy's edition of Suidas (Halle, 1853), i. 527, notes.) Suidas then continues without interruption:

"His Word (Logos), perfect as He was, and fertile, and creative, entered into fertile Nature, indeed into fertile Water, and made Water fertile."

After saying this, he offers the following prayer:

AN ORPHIC HYMN

"I invoke you, Heaven, wise work of the mighty God; I invoke you, Word of the Father, which He spoke first when He established the world! I invoke you, O Heaven, by the only-begotten Word (Logos) himself, and by the Father of the only-begotten Word, indeed, by the Father who encompasses all,—be gracious, be gracious!"

This is not a prayer from Hermes but three verses (the last somewhat altered) of an Orphic hymn excerpted from Cyril.Here is the text converted into modern English and simplified without altering its original meaning:

33 (Migne, col. 552 C) - lines also attributed to "Orpheus" by Justin Martyr. The latter part of the prayer seems to be a pure invention by Suidas or his editor, partially based on Cyril's comments.

Here, we may conveniently mention the Dialogue of an ancient Christian writer on astrology--a blend of Platonism, Astrology, and Christianity--titled Hermippus de Astrologia Dialogus, named after the main speaker. This writer was undoubtedly familiar with our Corpus, as he quotes (p. 9, 3) from C. H., i. 5; (p. 21, 5) from C. H., x. (xi.) 12; (p. 70, 17) from C. H., x. (xi.) 6; in general terms (p. 24, 25) from C. H., xvi.; and phrases (p. 12, 21 and p. 14, 13) from C. H., xviii.

ZOSIMUS

ON THE ANTHROPOS-DOCTRINE

Zosimus flourished at the end of the third and beginning of the fourth century A.D. He was a member of what Reitzenstein (p. 9) calls the Poimandres community. In writing to Theosebeia, a fellow believer in the Wisdom tradition, though not yet initiated into its spiritual mysteries, he urges her to hasten to Poimandres and baptize herself in the Cup.The following quote is crucial for understanding the Anthropos-Doctrine or Myth of Man in the Mysteries. In one of the books of his great work, marked by the letter Omega and dedicated to Oceanus as the "Genesis and Seed of all the Gods," he speaks about the uninitiated—those still under the influence of Fate and unable to understand his revelations. He writes:

THE PROCESSIONS OF FATE
1. Such men, according to Hermes in his work "Concerning Nature," are called mindless, merely "processions" of Fate. They have no understanding of anything incorporeal or even of Fate herself, who rightfully guides them. They criticize her physical teachings and only understand her favors.

2. But Hermes and Zoroaster have said that the Race of Wisdom-Lovers is superior to Fate. They do not rejoice in her favors, as they have mastered pleasures, nor are they struck down by her misfortunes, as they always stay at the "Inner Door," not accepting her gifts. They look toward the end of her misfortunes.

3. For this reason, Hesiod presents Prometheus advising Epimetheus not to accept the Gift from Zeus, who rules Olympus, but to send it back. Through philosophy, Hesiod teaches his brother to return the Gifts of Zeus—that is, of Fate.

4. Zoroaster, proud of his knowledge of all things Above and of the magical power of spoken words, claims that all misfortunes of Fate, both specific and general, can be avoided in this way.Hermes, in his work "About the Inner Door," advises against using magic. He states that:

A spiritual person, someone who knows themselves, should not accomplish anything through magic, even if they believe it to be beneficial. They should not try to force Necessity but should allow it to take its natural course. This person should progress by seeking knowledge of themselves and God, aiming to attain the Trinity that cannot be named, and let Fate do whatever it will to the body.

And by living in this way, they will see the Son of God becoming all things for holy souls, to draw them out from the realm of Fate into the Incorporeal Man. For He has power in all things and becomes whatever He wills. In obedience to the Father, He penetrates the whole Body and pours His Light into the mind of every soul, guiding it back to the Blessed Region where it was before it became physical. The soul follows Him, yearning and led by Him into the Light.

There it will see the Image described by Bitos, Plato, and Hermes (also known as Thoth, the First Man and Interpreter of all things). Thoth translated it into the first sacred language and named all embodied things.

The Chaldeans, Parthians, Medes, and Hebrews call Him Adam, which means virgin Earth, blood-red Earth, fiery Earth, and fleshly Earth.The Ptolemies stored these indications in their libraries, especially in the Serapeum. They asked Asenas, the chief priest of Jerusalem, to send a "Hermes" to translate the entire Hebrew text into Greek and Egyptian.

The First Man is called Thoyth by us and Adam by them. This name is symbolic and not His true name in the language of the Angels. It represents His body through the four elements. His inner, spiritual self also has an authentic name and a common name.

I do not know His authentic name due to the passage of time; only Nikotheos, who cannot be found, knows it. The common name is Man (Phos), so men are called photas.

When Light-Man (Phos) was in Paradise, under the influence of Fate, He was persuaded to clothe Himself in the Adam made of the four elements. They claimed He would be free from ills and activities, and He agreed for this 'freedom from ills'. However, they boasted as if He had become their servant.

Hesiod said the outer man was the "bond" by which Zeus bound Prometheus. Pandora, whom the Hebrews call Eve, was another bond. Prometheus and Epimetheus represent one Man—Soul and Body. Sometimes He resembles the soul, other times the mind, and sometimes the flesh, due to Epimetheus' lack of heed to Prometheus' counsel, his own mind.

Our Mind says:
Because the Son of God has power over everything, He can appear in any form He desires to each person.

Until the end of the world, He will come both secretly and openly to His followers, advising them to reconcile with their inner accuser, symbolized by Adam, and to strive for the spiritual enlightenment represented by the man of light.

THE FALSE SPIRIT

These events will continue until the False Spirit tries to deceive them, claiming to be the Son of God, despite having no true form or substance. But those who truly understand the Son of God will reject this falsehood, overcoming their inner adversary (Adam) and freeing their spirits to return to their original divine state.

The Hebrews and the sacred texts of Hermes tell us about the man of light and his guide, the true Son of God, and about the earthy Adam and his guide, the False Spirit, who falsely claims to be the Son of God to lead people astray.

The Greeks refer to the earthy Adam as Epimetheus, who, despite being warned by his own mind (his brother) not to accept gifts from Zeus, is deceived and seeks redemption in the Blessed Land. 

Prometheus, symbolizing the mind, provides good counsel to those who can understand, while those who only understand fleshly desires are controlled by fate.

ADVICE TO THEOSEBEIA

Finally, we can consider the advice given by Zosimus to the lady Theosebeia, which parallels the teachings found in the Corpus Hermeticum.After speaking out against the "false prophets" through whom demons work, not only demanding offerings but also ruining souls, Zosimus continues:

"But do not be troubled, my lady, as I advised you during the rituals. Do not search for God everywhere; stay still in your house, and God will come to you. He is everywhere, not confined to small places like demons are. 

"And after calming your body, calm your emotions too—desire, pleasure, anger, grief, and the twelve fates of death. 

"When you are upright and steady, call upon Divinity, and He will come, as He is everywhere and nowhere. 

"Then, without directly invoking them, perform the sacred rites against demons—not to appease and nourish them, but to repel and destroy their power, as Mambres taught Solomon, the King of Jerusalem, and as Solomon himself wrote from his wisdom. 

"If you perform these rites effectively, you will achieve a state of pure birth. Continue until you perfect your soul completely. 

"When you are certain you are perfected, let go of material things and seek refuge in Poemandres' embrace. Immerse yourself in His presence and return to your true nature."

This is how Zosimus understood the teachings of the Trismegistic tradition, based on his own experience.Just as processions pass along a path without being able to do anything but follow the road set by others, so do people driven by bodily pleasures move through life.

Refer to volume i., chapter v., on "Hermes according to Manetho."
19. Refers to the creation of names or words imitating natural sounds. Compare to Adam in Genesis.Plato, Philebus, 18 B: "A god, or rather a godlike man named Theuth, according to Egyptian tradition, noticed that sound was infinite. He first identified a certain number of pure sounds (vowels), then other sounds that are not pure (semi-vowels), and finally, a third group called mutes. He divided these groups into their individual elements, counted them, and named each as letters." (See Jowett's Translation, 3rd edition, vol. 4, pp. 583, 584.)

In the Gnostic Marcus's number system, there are seven vowels, eight semi-vowels, and nine mutes (F. F. F., p. 368). Interestingly, these sound elements are used in what Marcus refers to as the "Configuration of the Element" (Sound) and they form the Glyph (Character, Impression, or Expression) of the Figure (Diagram) of the Man of Truth. The term "Glyph of the Figure" (character of the letter) can mean (i) an alphabet letter, (ii) a musical note, or (iii) a mathematical figure or diagram (ibid., p. 367).

Is there a connection between the Pinax of Bitos and the Diagram of the Ophites mentioned by Celsus? ^277:1 Refers to the First Man. ^277:2 Possibly related to blood. ^277:3 Possibly an error in the manuscript. ^277:4 Refers to libraries. ^277:5 Refers to a learned priest or scribe. ^277:6 Much translation of this kind was done during that period. Compare the Arabic translation of a "Book of Ostanes" (Berthelot, La Chimie au Moyen Age, vol. 3, p. 121), which quotes an old inscription on an Egyptian stele: "Have you not heard the story that a certain philosopher [i.e.An Egyptian priest wrote to the Magi in Persia, saying: "I have found a copy of an ancient book, but it is written in Persian, which I cannot read. Please send me one of your wise men who can read this book for me."

Presumably, this refers to the entire structure of the Heavenly Man, to whose parts all the letters were assigned by Marcus.

The term "prosegorikon" generally signifies the given name as opposed to the proper name.

The phrase "dia to teus" literally means "because of the so long." This likely refers to the long period since the physical tradition of the ancient Thoth initiates had disappeared, or the length of time the soul of Zosimus had been revolving in Genesis.

The term "God-victor" symbolizes the victory of the Inner God or a man who has elevated himself to the status of a god. For more on Nikotheos, see the Gnostic "Untitled Apocalypse" of the Codex Brucianus: "Nikotheos has spoken of Him and seen Him; for he is one of those who have seen Him face to face. He said: 'The Father exists exalted above all the perfect.' He has revealed the Invisible and the perfect Triple-power."

In the Life of Plotinus by Porphyry, among the list of "Gnostics" against whose views on Matter Plotinus wrote one of the books of his Enneads, there is mention of Nikotheos in close connection with Zoroaster and others.

If we turn to Schmidt's "Plotinus' Position on Gnosticism and Church Christianity," which examines the treatise of Plotinus and the passage of Porphyry, we find further consideration of Nikotheos.Schmidt (p. 61) considers the "hidden Nikotheos" to be a "heavenly being," essentially the same as the Only-begotten, and therefore, the revealer of Himself. This Only-begotten is the "Light-Darkness" mentioned on p. 13a of the "Untitled Apocalypse" by C. B. In other words, Nikotheos appears to be another name for the Triumphant Christ. Refer to R. Liechtenhan's "Die Offenbarung in Gnosticismus" (Gottingen, 1901), p. 31. This explains the inner meaning, but could there be an outer one as well?

Since there was an apocalypse, and the words of Nikotheos are quoted, there was a seer, a prophet, a Christ, who had witnessed and passed on the message. Interestingly, one of the nicknames given to Jesus (Jeschu) in Rabbinical theological debates was Balaam (Bileam), meaning "Destroyer of the people." Could there be a connection between Nikotheos and Nikolaos (the Greek equivalent of Balaam)? There are many other parallels in the Talmud Jeschu stories where derogatory names on the Rabbinical side match with exalted names on the Gnostic and Christian side.

So, could the words of Nikotheos be a fragment from an "Apocalypse of Jesus"? Furthermore, might Balaam-Nikolaos—considering the mystic wordplay of the time—symbolically represent both the "victory of the many" (laos) and the "Victor of the many"? In Philo's writings, "people" signifies the "many" as opposed to the "one race" (genos), which encapsulates all His "limbs" in Christ.

^279:1 According to R., "fus" means "Light." 
^279:2 This appears to be a quotation. 
^279:3 Interpreting "diapneomenos" with the manuscripts, not "diapneomenui" with R., meaning "exhaling his light." In the Egypto-Gnostic tradition of the Pistis Sophia, it is the role of the Rulers of Fate to "squeeze out" light from souls and consume or absorb it into themselves. 
^279:4 The Rulers of Fate.Certainly! Here is the simplified and modernized version of the text:

^279:5 Refers to Fate.
^279:6 Refers to the Seven Rulers or Energies of the Fate-sphere.
^280:1 This seems to be a quote from a Greek translation of one of the Chaldaean Books found in the Serapeum. It appears to be a source that both Hebrew and non-Hebrew Hellenists in Alexandria commented on. Both the commentator in S. and J. in the Naassene Document and the Poemandrists of that time likely used it.
^280:2 Theog., 614.
^280:3 Compare sections 3 and 19.
^280:4 This refers to Fore-thought and After-thought.
^280:5 Refers to Man.
^280:6 I believe section 14 is also a quote or summary, not just Zosimus's simple explanation. The original may have been written by a non-Hebrew Hellenistic allegorist.
^280:7 Refers to Poemandres, the Shepherd of men.
^280:8 Compare with section 7 above; this is evidently a quote from the "Inner Door." Also compare the saying quoted by S. (section 8) in the Naassene Document from some Hellenistic scripture: "I become what I will, and am what I am." Does Hermes and S. rely on the same scripture, perhaps in the form of an apocalypse? Does Hermes in his "expository sermon" rely on direct teaching from the Mind to himself, which would be instruction in the first person?
^281:1 tyflegorountos. This word is not found in lexicons. It is probably a play on kategorountos. Compare the note on "blind from birth" of C. in the Conclusion of Hippolytus in "Myth of Man" (vol. i. p. 189).
^281:2 This likely refers to the soul that sees in the Light, as opposed to the blind body. This passage reflects a similar thought as Matthew 5:25 (= Luke 12:57-59): "Agree with your adversary quickly while you are on the way with him, lest at any time the adversary delivers you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be cast into prison."Truly, I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny. The third Evangelist, instead of the vague term "agree," uses precise terms like "apellaxthai," which refers to the discharge of a debt, and "praktur," an officer responsible for collecting taxes and debts. The Gnostics interpreted this saying as referring to the reincarnation of the soul into another body to settle its karmic debts. 

The term "counterfeit spirit" (antimimon pneuma) frequently appears in the Pistis Sophia. The Counterfeit Daimon is another term used, which can also mean execution.

The last two paragraphs seem to be quoted or summarized from a Hellenistic commentary on a Book of the Hebrews, translated into Greek, and found in the Ptolemies' libraries. It's notable that this book's content is similar to the Books quoted in the Naassene Document and the ideas about the Chaldaeans presented by the commentator of S.

If we can trust Zosimus's statement, it proves that there was a developed Anthropos-doctrine in the Trismegistic Books, separate from the Chaldaean Books. This means the Poemandrists had their own tradition, specifically Egyptian, rather than borrowing from the Chaldaean Books.

"Changing his mind" is a literal translation. There is a gap in the text, but it seems Zosimus had access to the texts of S. and the source of J. For "Blessed Land," see section 7 above.

Berth., p. 244; for a revised text see R. 214, n. 1. The twelve tormenting or avenging daimones of C. H., xiii. (xiv.). The famous Egyptian Theurgist and Magician, who is said to have contended with Moses, while others believe he was Moses' instructor.### II. Jamblichus

**Abammon the Teacher**

Jamblichus' evidence is crucial because he connected the Later Platonic School, previously guided by purely philosophical figures like Ammonius, Plotinus, and Porphyry, with the centers of Gnosis into which he had been initiated. He provided instruction, particularly in Egyptian Wisdom, through his notable work commonly known as *On the Mysteries*. Although the authorship of this treatise is often debated, Proclus, who followed the direct tradition, attributes it to Jamblichus, lending credibility to its authenticity. Jamblichus speaks with the authority of a recognized expert in Egyptian Wisdom, using the name "Abammon, the Teacher," to address and clarify the principles of sacred science that were questioned by Porphyry. Jamblichus begins his explanation with these important words:

**Hermes the Inspirer**

"Hermes, the God who guides us in sacred teachings, was rightly considered common to all priests in ancient times. Since he is responsible for the true science of the Gods, he is consistent in all our sacred teachings. Therefore, our ancestors attributed all their wisdom discoveries to Hermes, naming all writings on such subjects after him. If we too share in the portion of this God that is ours, according to our ability to receive him, you do well to ask us priests, your friends, to address certain theological questions."I assume that the letter sent to my student Anebo was meant for me, so I will provide you with the correct answers to your questions. It's important that Pythagoras, Plato, Democritus, Eudoxus, and many other ancient Greeks received proper instruction from the keepers of sacred knowledge in their time, and you, being like-minded and our contemporary, should also receive guidance from the current holders of the title "Common Teachers."

From this passage, we understand that the Egyptians considered books on the science of sacred things, especially those concerning the hierarchy from humans up to the Supreme Ruler, to be "inspired." The Spiritual Sun's Ray, which illuminated sacred science, was seen as a Person. The Greeks identified this Person with their God Hermes due to similar attributes. Hermes was "common" to the priests of sacred science, meaning this special Ray of the Spiritual Sun lit up their studies. However, not all were equally enlightened, as there were many levels in the mysteries, many steps towards union with the Deity. The Rays of the Spiritual Sun are essentially One Light, polarized differently by the "spheres" discussed in Trismegistic texts. These Rays come from the Logos, each illuminating a part of the hierarchy of beings from the Logos to humans, and further characterizing the lower kingdoms like animals, plants, and minerals. For example, in the animal kingdom, the ibis, the ape, and the dog are especially sacred to Thoth or Hermes.### Those of the Hermetic Nature

Among people in general, there are some who have characteristics of a "Hermetic" nature. The more advanced individuals among these are suited to specific lines of study and research. Among the few who are truly aware of the science of sacred things—namely, the initiated students or priests—the direct influence of this Ray or Person starts to be consciously felt, each according to their ability, as Jamblichus says, because there are still many levels of understanding.

In these strictly hierarchical schools of initiation, there was a unique consensus and a grand doctrine of identification. This meant that when a student received their next level of initiation, they became identified with their master. The master, in turn, embodied all that was above him, essentially becoming Hermes for the student. The master was the messenger of the Word and the channel through which divine inspiration flowed. This made it natural to attribute all sacred scriptures, such as initiation sermons, to Hermes.

This was not like a modern author claiming copyright over their work, but rather the recorder, scribe, or copyist passing on sacred tradition. As long as this tradition remained within the disciplined schools of sacred science, it was safe. However, when irresponsible individuals began to copy the method without adhering to its discipline, and started attributing their own writings to great teachers for personal gain, they created the chaos and confusion we are currently experiencing.### The Books of Hermes

Towards the end of his work, Jamblichus discusses the countless hierarchies and sub-hierarchies of being. He explains that these are so complex that ancient priests had to approach them from different perspectives. Even among the wise people of his own time, there was no single unified teaching. Jamblichus states that Hermes fully described the main states of being in either 20,000 books, according to Seleucus, or 36,525 books, according to Manetho. The sub-states, however, were explained in many other writings by ancient scholars, with some breaking down certain sub-states further.

At first glance, it might seem unlikely that it took 20,000 volumes to outline the main framework of the cosmic system. Jamblichus seems to suggest that libraries containing books on sacred science provided a general overview of the cosmos, with various details added by many writers, each focusing on a small part of the whole. Regarding the number of books, we should remember that a book didn't mean a large volume but rather a section or chapter of such a volume. Thus, it's not surprising to hear of a person writing 6,000 "books." However, this explanation seems unsatisfactory. The specific number 36,525, which Jamblichus mentions from Manetho, instead of the vague 20,000 from Seleucus, cannot be dismissed so easily. We immediately notice that 365 multiplied by 25 approximates the length of the solar year. Additionally, 36,525 years equals 25 Sothiac cycles (1461 * 25 = 36,525), a significant time period in Egyptian secret astronomy, corresponding to the revolution of the zodiac or the Great Year.Consider this: If Jamblichus meant that Hermes inscribed the cosmos' design not in 36,525 books or chapters on papyrus, but rather in the heavens as celestial markings, and if these chapters represented significant celestial events akin to how 365 days represent the sun's physical journey, then the frequently cited passage about Hermes writing actual books should be reconsidered. This passage, often mentioned in discussions of Hermetic writings, would need to be removed from these lists. Instead, it would reveal one of Hermes' true roles as an Initiator and Recorder to those knowledgeable in profound matters.

### THE MONAD FROM THE ONE

In the following chapter, Jamblichus first addresses the supreme God, then mentions the Logos, the God of our system, whom he calls "God of gods, the Monad from the One, existing before all and the source of all existence." He continues:

"From Him comes the essence and being of all things; thus, He is called the Father of being. He exists before all things and is the source of spiritual beings; hence, He is also called the Source of spiritual entities. These spiritual sources are the oldest origins of everything, and Hermes places them above the ethereal, empyrean, and celestial gods, leaving us a hundred books on the history of the empyrean, an equal number on the ethereal, and a thousand on the celestial."

I believe there might be an error in the numbers of these books. We should perhaps consider 10 books for the first category, 100 for the second, and 1,000 for the third. Regardless, all these numbers are multiples of the perfect number 10, which supports my theory with the additional information that Jamblichus provides.### The Tradition of Trismegistic Literature

Next, we come to a section that directly addresses our Trismegistic literature. Jamblichus tells Porphyry that with the explanations he has already provided, Porphyry will be able to understand the Hermetic writings he possesses. "For the books circulating under the name of Hermes contain Hermetic teachings, even though they often use the language of philosophers, since they were translated from Egyptian by people skilled in philosophy."

Jamblichus clearly states that these texts are translations. However, instead of being literal translations, the translators used the common terminology of Greek philosophers. He further mentions that physical astronomy and research are only a small part of Hermetic science and not the most important aspect. 

"The Egyptians do not believe that physics is everything. They distinguish both the life of the soul and the life of the mind from nature, not only in the cosmos but also in humans. They first acknowledge Mind and Reason (Logos) as having their own unique existence, and then they explain that the world of becoming (or generation) is created. They identify the Creator as the source of all beings in generation and recognize the Life-giving Power that exists before and permeates the celestial spaces. Above the universe, they place Pure Mind, which is one and undivided for the entire universe but is expressed differently in various spheres."They do not speculate about these matters using only reason. Instead, they claim that through their divine priestly science, they can reach higher and more universal states of consciousness, beyond the Seven Spheres of Destiny, ascending to God the Creator without any material means, using only the observation of the right moment. Hermes was the first to teach this Path. The prophet Bitys translated his teachings for King Ammon, having discovered them in an inscription in the sacred characters at the inner temple in Sais, Egypt. From these writings, Bitys passed on the tradition of the Name of God, described as "That which pervades the whole universe."

Regarding the Good Itself, the Egyptians see it as transcending all thought when related to the Divine and as unity with God when related to man—a doctrine Bitys translated from the Hermetic Books.

From these passages, we learn that the ancient doctrine of Hermes about the Path, which is central to our Trismegistic texts, was found either in sacred inscriptions within the secret chambers of temples, inaccessible to the uninitiated, or in "books" also written in the sacred script. These texts had never been translated until the reign of King Ammon. But what does "translated" mean here? Not necessarily into Greek, but more likely interpreted from hieroglyphic symbols into the Egyptian vernacular and written in the demotic script. The term used (diermeneuein) supports this interpretation, while if translation from Egyptian into Greek was meant, the term (metagrafein) would have likely been used, as employed by Jamblichus when referring to Hermetic books read by Porphyry.Reitzenstein (p. 108) is confident that Bitys wrote in Greek and that Jamblichus used these writings as his sole source. However, I'm not certain this is what the Greek text means. I believe there were likely two stages of translation: first from hieroglyphics to demotic, then from demotic to Greek. We know very little about Bitys beyond what Jamblichus tells us. Perhaps Bitys was the first to translate the sacred hieroglyphs into the common language and script, meaning he broke the ancient tradition of only writing holy texts in sacred characters. But Bitys was probably not the only one to do this. In our Trismegistic literature, we find a text addressed to a King Ammon. Could this King have initiated a change in the priests' longstanding practices? It's possible, but we don't have enough information to be sure.

Regarding Bitys, Zosimus (section 8) provides another clue. He describes the Logos, the Son of God, illuminating the soul and guiding it back to the Blessed Region, as discussed in the Trismegistic tractate "Concerning the Inner Door." Zosimus writes:

"There it will see the Picture that Bitos described, along with Plato and Hermes, for Thoythos translated it into the first sacred language, Thoth the First Man."

This confirms that Bitys and Bitos are the same person.Reitzenstein argues that neither of the name forms is Egyptian and agrees with Dieterich's suggestion that our Bitys is the same as "Pitys the Thessalian" mentioned in the Papyri. The headings of the fragments of Pitys' writings in the Papyri include: "The Way of Pitys," "Pitys to King Ostanes Greeting," "The Way of Pitys the King," and "Of Pitys the Thessalian." Reitzenstein concludes that by the second and third centuries AD, Pitys was already considered among the prophetic theologians and Magians. The exact date of these Papyri is difficult to determine, but regardless of their age, it is clear that Pitys was seen as an ancient figure and a contemporary of the Magian Sage Ostanes.

King refers to a passage by the Elder Pliny (Natural History, Book 30, Chapter 4) that notes the similarity between Magian Gnosis and the Druidical Gnosis of Gaul and Britain. Pliny understands "Magica" as the rites instituted by Zoroaster and first introduced to the world by Osthanes, who was a "military chaplain" to Xerxes during his expedition to Greece. If this date is accurate, it would take us back to the Persian Conquest of Egypt. However, it is unclear what a Thessalian Pitys has to do with that.

Interestingly, Pliny also mentions in his 28th book the writings of a certain Bithus of Dyrrachium, a city on the coast of Illyricum, also known as Epidamnus in Greek history. This is quite confusing, but the evidence suggests that Bitys was ancient. Therefore, any translation or "interpretation" likely went from hieroglyphic to demotic, and later from demotic to Greek.But is Ostanes the traditional Magian Sage, or can we adopt Maspero's brilliant conclusion that equates Ostanes with Asclepius, placing him in the same group as Bitys? Or, perhaps, see Bitys as an "Asclepius"? Regardless, the following interesting paragraph by Granger deserves our close attention:

"Maspero, following Goodwin, has shown that Ostanes is the name of a deity associated with the Thoth cycle. The Egyptians themselves derived his name, Ysdnw, from a verb meaning 'to distinguish,' and he was a patron of intellectual perception. Over time, his importance grew. Under the Ptolemies, he was often depicted on Temple walls. In Pliny, he appears as an early writer on medicine. Some of the medical prescriptions attributed to him are very much in the Egyptian style. Philo Byblius, though not highly reliable, mentions a book by Ostanes called the Octateuch. It is tempting to identify this with a collection similar to the six medical books listed by Clement. Pliny, based on his list of sources, does not quote Ostanes directly. Since Democritus is mentioned by Pliny in the same context, and Ostanes is the legendary teacher of Democritus during his journey to Egypt, it is likely that Pliny relies on Democritus for his mention of Ostanes. If Democritus's visit to Egypt is considered a historical fact, he would be dealing with a medical collection under the name of Ostanes. Asclepius, who appears in the Poemander, would be the Greek equivalent of Ostanes. Thus, the pairing of Hermes and Asclepius is similar to the relationship of the Egyptian deities Thoth and Ysdnw."The Bitys-books contained the same teachings as our Trismegistic writings, as shown by the entire treatise of Jamblichus. Jamblichus relies on the doctrines of Hermes and suggests that his information comes from Egyptian records, not just translations like Porphyry used. However, he does not specify whether his sources are the demotic texts of the Bitys-school or the original hieroglyphic records. Anyone who has read our Trismegistic literature and Jamblichus's exposition can see that their doctrines are identical. For those who haven't read Jamblichus, here is a passage demonstrating the similarity of ideas. When discussing free will and necessity, and responding to the claim that Egyptians taught astrological fatalism, Jamblichus writes:

"We need to clarify this issue using concepts from the Hermaic writings. According to these writings, humans have two souls. One comes from the First Mind and shares in the Creator's Power, while the other, which is bound, comes from the revolution of the celestial spheres. The latter soul is later joined by the former, the soul that sees God. Thus, the soul descending from the worlds aligns with their cycles, while the soul from the Mind exists in us spiritually and is free from the cycle of generation. This spiritual soul breaks the bonds of Destiny, creates the path to the spiritual Gods, and through such a life, achieves the Great Divine Art that leads beyond the spheres of Genesis."**The Cosmic Spheres**

Jamblichus makes it clear that these Spheres are not the physical planets, as shown in the following passages from his work "De Mysteriis":

"Regarding individual existences, like a soul in partial manifestation, we must recognize that a soul, before entering a human body, creates a specific type of body as its instrument. This body is accompanied by a corresponding nature that receives the more perfect life the soul pours into it. For higher existences around the Source of All, the inferior are contained within the superior. Bodies exist within bodiless entities, and the former are kept in position by the latter enclosing them in a sphere. 

The revolutions of the heavenly bodies, being initially set in the celestial revolutions of the aethereal Soul, continue in this relationship forever. The Souls of the invisible Worlds, extending to their shared Mind, are completely surrounded by it and have their origin in it. Mind, both in part and as a whole, is contained within superior states of existence."

Jamblichus also writes:

"We assert that the Spiritual Sun, Moon, and others are not contained within their Bodies. Rather, they contain these Bodies within the Spheres of their own vitality and energy. Their Bodies move towards their Divine Cause, and do not hinder the perfection of their Spiritual and Incorporeal Nature by being within it."Proclus writes in his Commentary on the Timaeus of Plato that each of the seven planetary spheres is a complete world with numerous divine beings that are invisible to us. The visible star in each sphere is its ruler. Fixed stars differ from those in the planetary spheres because they have only one governing principle, their system as a whole. In contrast, the invisible globes within the planetary spheres have two governing principles: one for the system as a whole and another for their specific characteristics developed within each sphere. This dual hierarchy is necessary because these globes are secondary to fixed stars and require both overall and specific governance.

In each sphere, there is a group of beings on the same level as the sphere itself. For example, if the fixed sphere has a group of celestial beings and Earth has a group of earthly animals, it follows that every whole system should have beings on the same level as itself. These groups are called wholes because they encompass all beings at their level. However, the intermediate levels are not visible to us; we can only see the extremes, either because of their extraordinary brilliance or their similarity to us.

This explanation relates to what Theosophical students know as the "planetary chains" of our system. Therefore, these spheres are not the physical planets we see. The visible planets are just a small part of these chains, and some of these chains have no visible globes at all.The attribution of the "influence" of these Spheres to the sun, moon, and five visible planets is, at best, a temporary solution, a "correspondence," or a "symbolism."

Footnotes

The exact date of Jamblichus is uncertain. In my "Lives of the Later Platonists," I have suggested around A.D. 255-330. See The Theosophical Review (Aug. 1896), xviii. 462, 463. I translate from Parthey's text (Berlin, 1857). The term logos is used technically here, referring to a sacred or inspired sermon or course of instruction. Parthey here adds an interesting note: "The Egyptian teachers of Pythagoras were Oenuphis of On (Plut., De Is. et Os., 10) and Sonchis (Clem. Al., Strom., i. 15, 69); Plato was taught by Sechnuphis of On (Clem. l.c.) and Chonuphis (Plut., De Gen. Socr., 578); Democritus by Pammenes of Memphis (Georg. Sync., i. 471 Dind.); Eudoxus by Chonuphis of Memphis (Plut. and Clem. ll. cc.)." Parthey also lists other famous Greeks who learned from Egyptian teachers: Alcaeus, Anaxagoras of Clazomenae, Appuleius, Archimedes, Bias, Chrysippus of Cnidus, Cleobulus, Daedalus, Decaeneus, Diodorus Siculus, Ellopion, Euripides, Hecataeus of Abdera, Hecataeus of Miletus, Hellanicus, Herodotus, Homer, Lycurgus, Melampus, Musaeus, Oenopides of Chios, Orpheus, Pausanias, Pherecydes, Polybius, Simmias, Solon, Sphaerus, Strabo, Telecles, Thales, Theodorus, Xenophanes of Colophon, and Zamolxis. I have quoted this note to show the overwhelming evidence against the theory that Greek philosophy was solely a native product.The Greeks themselves universally claim that their top philosophers, geometers, mathematicians, historians, geographers, and particularly their theosophists, were students of Egyptian wisdom. The modern idea that Greek philosophy developed independently is, in my opinion, completely wrong. While the Greeks' unique style of philosophizing was their own creation, the content came from ancient traditions. For reference, see Plutarch's "On Isis and Osiris," chapter 10.

The term "mercurial temperament" and similar phrases have come to us through astrological traditions. Porphyry mentions a "theologist" named Seleucus, and Suidas states that Seleucus of Alexandria wrote a 100-volume work on the gods.

For further details, refer to Georgius Syncellus' "Chronography" and Eusebius' "Chronicle." The life of the body is distributed among different spheres. The term "by the theurgy known to the priests" refers to the creative aspect of the mind and the path to God.

Some writers identify one of the last kings of the Saitic dynasty (around 570 B.C.) with this figure, but since there's no concrete evidence, we just note it. For more information, see the notes on Zosimus.As suggested by Hoffmann and Riess in Pauly-Wissowa's Realencyklopädie, i. 1347. R. 108. Dieterich in Jahr. f.

### THE DISCIPLES OF WISDOM

God has not cared only for the Hebrews. In His love for all nations, He has given the Hebrews nothing of significant importance, while bestowing far greater gifts upon others. For example, the Egyptians can name many sages from their own race who have followed in the footsteps of Hermes, particularly the Third Hermes who frequently visited Egypt. The Chaldaeans can speak of the disciples of Oannes and Belus. Likewise, the Greeks can point to countless individuals who have acquired wisdom from Cheiron.

**Notes:**

1. ^301:5 Refers to the sphere of fixed stars or suns.
2. ^301:6 Refers to all the visible globes (commonly known as planets) in our solar system. The term "animal" means "living thing," so "earthy animals" here means the living vehicles of the heavenly beings we mistakenly call "heavenly bodies."
3. ^301:7 Refers to suns or solar systems.
4. ^301:8 Here, "whole" means "plane."
5. ^301:9 Refers to the brilliant light of the suns in space and the reflected light of the physical globes of the planetary spheres in our system. See Proclus, Commentarius in Platonis Timaeum, Bk. iv., p. 279 D, E, p. 676, ed. Schneider (Vratislaviae, 1847). The passage is very technical and difficult to translate. Taylor's translation (London, 1820, ii. 281, 282) misses nearly every point.From him, they gained their understanding of nature’s secrets and divine knowledge. Compared to this, the Hebrews seem to boast about their own achievements. Julian tells us that the Third Hermes, likely the one in our texts, was not a historical figure but a spiritual teaching power who instructed from within.

Julian reigned from 360-363 A.D. and wrote "Contra Christianos" in the last year of his reign. Thomas Taylor also discussed Julian's arguments against Christians in his 1809 publication. The term "diadoxeis" means "from the succession," and "epifoite'santos" refers to a god's habitual inspiration.

IV. FULGENTIUS THE MYTHOGRAPHER

An intermediate version of our texts likely existed before Fulgentius. He refers to the first sermon in a crude phrase, "Hermes in Opinandre libro," and quotes its introduction. He also quotes from Corpus Hermeticum XII, mistakenly attributing it to Plato and adding in Greek:

FRAGMENT XXVIII. The human mind is god; if it is good, God showers His benefits upon us. Fulgentius mentions "The Definitions of Asclepius," saying Hermes Trismegistus spoke of three types of music: singing, harping, and piping.

Fulgentius, an Afro-Latin writer, lived no later than the sixth century.### Conclusion

### An Attempt at Classifying the Existing Literature

Before we conclude, it is useful to try to classify the existing sermons and fragments. Unfortunately, this cannot be done scientifically because the literature is too chaotic, even if it were complete. With our current fragmented information, we know of at least four unrelated collections: those referenced by Lactantius, Cyril, and Stobaeus, as well as our own incomplete collection from Byzantine tradition. There were likely other collections, such as the books used by Jamblichus, and the ancient manuscripts that Petosiris and Nechepso referenced.

### Of Hermes

First and foremost, we must consider:

**C.H. i.—"The Poemandres"**: This is the foundational Gospel of the School, serving as the self-instruction manual for the Hermes or Master grade. Based on it, though different in form, we have:

**C.H. xi. (xii.)—"Mind unto Hermes"**: This is a later text, but still relatively early, as it introduces the Aeon doctrine, which must be early. It is the esoteric teaching on the doctrines in **C.H. iv. (v.)—"The Cup"**, which was likely considered the most important sermon after "The Poemandres."

Of the lost early literature, we have no clear indication. However, the "Sayings of Agathodaimon" mentioned in the **Tat Sermon, C.H. xii. (xiii.)**, probably belong to the oldest layer of Trismegistic literature and can be compared to the "Sayings of Ammon" mentioned by Justin Martyr.These texts originally belonged exclusively to the Hermes-grade. Similar to the conclusion of the "Poemandres" in its current form, which represents a later development, we must classify:

C. H. iii. (iv.)--"The Sacred Sermon"; and
C. H. vii. (viii.)--"Whither stumble ye." Additionally, due to the lack of a better categorization, we must also include:

Ex. xxii.--"An Apophthegm of Hermes." 
Ex. xxiv.--"A Hymn of the Gods." 
Frag. xxvi.--From "The Inner Door." 
Frag. xxvii--"For Our Mind saith." The last text is likely one of the oldest pieces of this literature. The next best categorization is one that accommodates the largest number of pieces:

TO TAT

We know that the Tat instructions were divided into:

(a) "The General Sermons," with C. H. x. (xi.) --"The Key"--serving as the summary; and 
(b) "The Expository Sermons," with C. H. xiii. (xiv.) --"The Secret Sermon on the Mountain"--being the culmination. It is unclear if the Tat Sermons were only divided into these two categories. While we can identify some extracts as part of an Expository Sermon, it is often uncertain how to classify texts simply labeled "From the Sermon" or "Sermons to Tat." We do not know how many General Sermons existed or whether they were organized into Books like the Expository Sermons and the "To Asclepius" in the Corpus of Cyril. For ease of classification, we might arbitrarily consider all sermons and fragments that do not fit under "Expository" as "General." The General Sermons include:

C. H. (ii.)--"The General Sermon."
C. H. viii (ix.)--"That No One of Existing Things do Perish."
Ex. x.--"Concerning the Rule of Providence."
Ex. xi.--"Of Justice."
Ex. xx.--"The Power of Choice."
Frags. vi and vii.This text summarizes the content and organization of certain Hermetic writings as found in the Corpus of Cyril. The summary includes references to both "The General Sermons" and "The Expository Sermons," and it identifies which fragments and excerpts belong to each category.

"The Key" is considered the summary of "The General Sermons" and is addressed to Asclepius and Tat. It should be read together with "The Perfect Sermon."

"The Expository Sermons" in Cyril's Corpus consist of three books, containing various fragments and excerpts:

- First Book: Fragments 20 (?), 22, 23, 24, Excerpt 2, and Fragments 3, 11, 12, 15.
- General Assignments: Excerpt 3 (?), "Of Truth;" Excerpt 4; Excerpts 5, 6, 7, 8, 9; Excerpt 1, "Of Piety and True Philosophy."

From the Corpus Hermeticum, the following texts are tentatively assigned to this category:

- C.H. 4 (5), "The Cup."
- C.H. 5 (6), "Though Manifest."
- C.H. 7 (8), "About the Common Mind."

The series of "Expository Sermons" concludes with "The Initiation of Tat," represented by:

- C.H. 13 (14), "The Secret Sermon on the Mountain."

Next, we consider what Cyril calls "To Asclepius," which also consists of at least three books in his Corpus:

From the Corpus Hermeticum, the following are assigned to Asclepius:

- C.H. 2 (3), "An Introduction to the Gnosis of the Nature of All Things."
- C.H. 6 (7), "In God Alone is Good."
- C.H. 9 (10), "About Sense."
- C.H. 14 (15), "A Letter to Asclepius."

From Cyril's collection, we have:

- Fragment 25 (?), and from the Third "To Asclepius":
- Fragments 16-18. It is likely that "The Perfect Sermon" was included in this Third Book of Cyril's Corpus.This sermon, the longest one we have, was originally addressed solely to Asclepius, as its alternative title is "The Asclepius." My guess that the inclusion of the "holy three"—Asclepius, Tat, and Ammon—was added by a later editor is strongly supported by the evidence. Therefore, we can conclude our list with:

"The Perfect Sermon." For the fragments of the lost Greek original of this important document, see Lactantius:

Fragments v., viii., ix., x. This sermon should be closely connected with "The Key," which summarizes "The General Sermons" to Tat. To Ammon

Stobaeus attributes eight of his extracts to a book or books in his collection titled "To Ammon." These excerpts, however, seem to be more appropriately classified under "Sermons to Tat." Since Johannes explicitly describes them this way, we will include them here. Excerpts xii, xiii. Excerpts xiv.-xix.—"Of Soul," i.-vi. Excerpts xvi.-xix. follow one another in Stobaeus's text. Since excerpt xviii. refers to "The General Sermons," it suggests that either we are dealing with "The Expository Sermons" to Tat or that the Ammon-grade had already received "The General Sermons." These are the four types of Trismegistic Sermons

[p. 315]

proper, and we now turn to the writings of the Disciples of Hermes. Of Asclepius

It is notable that Asclepius, the most learned of the three, writes his treatises and letters not to philosophers, priests, students, or his younger brother Tat, but always to the King or Kings. He always writes to "Ammon," and the literature of this type was very rich if we can trust the writer or editor of C. H. (xvi.). The surviving fragments, however, are not numerous and include:

C. H. (xvi.)—"The Definitions of Asclepius."
Fragment iv.—Probably from the lost ending of the above. C. H. (xvii.)."Regarding Asclepius and the King"

There is a section, possibly more accurately titled "Regarding Asclepius and the King," instead of Stobaeus' title "Regarding Isis and Horus." No writings are attributed to either Tat or Ammon; when Tat achieves enlightenment, he becomes Hermes and writes as Hermes, while Ammon is a practical man who does not teach. Can we then infer that Asclepius was knowledgeable and theoretical but not capable of direct enlightenment like Tat?

The next category of writings is titled:

REGARDING ISIS

It's unclear if the versions of these writings we have are from the same time period as the Tat and Asclepius sermons or from later on; however, they are based on ancient texts called "Books of Isis to Horus." We categorize the following under this type:

- Ex. xxi.—"Regarding Isis to Horus." But as we suggested, this might be an error by Johannes and should instead be "Regarding Asclepius to the King."
- Ex. xxiii.—"From Aphrodite," where Aphrodite likely represents Isis.
- Exx. xxv., xxvi.—"The Virgin of the World."
- Ex. xxvii.—"From the Sermon of Isis to Horus."

The last category of writings is linked to Osiris, the disciple of Agathodaimon, the Thrice-Greatest, under the heading:

FROM THE AGATHODAIMON LITERATURE

All these fragments come from Cyril's collection and are labeled "To Asclepius" by him. However, we have not included them under this heading in our preliminary classification because they clearly aren't addressed to Asclepius. Instead, they belong to a different type of literature, likely similar to the ancient "Books of Isis." This category includes:

- Fragments xiii., xiv., xix., xxi.This text can be modernized and simplified as follows:

This form may be better grouped with the "Sayings of Agathodaimon" and the "Sayings of Ammon as Agathodaimon," both of which belong to the oldest types of Trismegistic literature. Finally, we include an appendix to our Corpus written by a Poemandrist rhetorician and apologist:

C. H. (xviii.)--"The Encomium of Kings." [p. 317]

This should be considered along with a quote from the editor of Cyril's Corpus of XV. Books. And so, we reach the end of our tentative classification. We fully believe, however, that since no one classified this literature when it was plentiful and collected in various corpora, any inventory we make now, with only fragments remaining, cannot be scientifically valuable. At best, we can present the reader with a few organized collections of scattered pieces from different times.

On Judgments of Value

We are now nearing the conclusion of our task, feeling that the entire matter should be set aside for years before making any value judgments. We are still too entangled in details to clearly see the whole picture. Despite this, we will try to share some general impressions of our journey through this complex subject—the many twists and turns, and the numerous dead ends we've encountered while following historical and critical paths. Often, we've found no way out, even when guided by the insights from the doctrines of the tradition. It is indeed challenging to maintain objectivity while also engaging deeply with the subjective and unmanifest aspects of this work.This almost superhuman task is the Great Work set before every scholar of Gnosis—the person who seeks to think clearly and judge fairly. Such a person must view matters from all perspectives, evaluating them from the inside and outside, from above and below, striving to unite the center and the boundaries in a way that transcends our divided senses and intellect. The Trismegistic literature is like scripture, and to understand it, we must use all the faculties that the best minds of today apply to their own valued scriptures, which each might consider the most precious legacy from the past to the present.

Applying what is called "criticism" to scripture is like wielding a double-edged sword; not only is it double-edged, but it is also fiery. If used correctly, it will dispel errors and clear a path to the Paradise of Truth; but if used incorrectly, it will backfire on the daring soul who tries to grasp it, becoming the flaming sword in the hands of the Angel-Warden that keeps him from the Gate of Heaven. Criticism, which some fear and tremble before, and others scorn and despise, is the sword that Christ has brought to earth in these latter days. 

There is now a conflict within the faithful, a war within themselves that they cannot escape if God has given them a mind to reason with. Every intelligent person who loves their own special scripture is acutely aware of the internal conflict—head against heart and heart against head, form against substance and substance against form. This is deeply felt by those who cherish their own Bible; but how few can truly understand the feelings of another who loves a different Bible just as fervently? Who can be genuinely fair to another person's religion?We don't mean a completely lifeless indifference, where only the intellect is involved—many people who study the comparative science of religion are like this. Instead, we mean a lively empathy that recognizes another person's religion as the most important thing to them and a revelation of God's wisdom.

In discussing the "Religion of the Mind," or the Gnosis of Thrice-greatest Hermes, I've tried to approach it with the same love and reverence that I believe its followers did. I would approach any other major religion the same way (and have done so in some cases), with a sincere desire to understand it free from bias. While no human mind can fully grasp divine revelation in any of its major forms, I aim to share in its enlightenment, even if only imperfectly.

However, this open-minded attitude is often criticized by those who fear being seen as disloyal to their own faith. Their goal in studying other religions is to "prove" that their own faith is the ultimate truth and that all other religions are false or even evil. But God, who is the Father of all, has no enemies; He has many children whom He loves equally, even if they don't believe in Him. There is only one religion, expressed in many great forms, and these forms have countless variations, as numerous as the individual minds and hearts of people.Here, I want to share my current, though imperfect, understanding of Christianity. There may be readers who will criticize my perspective because it differs from theirs. My belief in the leader of Christianity is limitless; I cannot restrict or define it, for this leader represents ultimate wisdom to me. How can any human mind limit the boundless Mystery that includes Jesus Christ, Gautama Buddha, Zoroaster, Lao-tze, Orpheus, Pythagoras, Hermes, and other great teachers? By acknowledging these other wise figures, I do not diminish the greatness of Jesus Christ. They are all part of one divine kinship, united rather than separate. 

Only those who believe they are wise enough to understand every aspect of these teachings can judge them. I cannot claim to know everything, nor will I judge those who are considered judges of the living and the dead. I leave such judgments to those who might forget their Savior's teaching: "Judge not."

If some still see me as a detractor, it is a natural misunderstanding. However, true Justice exists in the universe. Anyone seeking to be justified and resurrected must balance seeming mortal justice and injustice to find true balance. This frees one from mortal opinions and allows them to stand in the Hall of Truth.In the end, everyone appeals to this Judgment Hall, whether they are Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, Buddhist, Taoist, Zoroastrian, or follow any other faith, or even a belief that encompasses all faiths. Christianity is the religion of the Western World, best suited to its nature and form. The one who brought this faith did so generously from many sources, and the greatest sign of His authority was revealing some of the ancient secret teachings to everyone, regardless of age, gender, class, caste, color, nationality, or education. The inner doors of the Temple were opened to the common people, but the innermost door remained closed. This door is not made by man; it opens to the essence of things and not to formal instruction. It naturally remained closed to the unworthy and ignorant, but no longer could any Scribe or Pharisee keep its key selfishly. The key was given to all, but still in a mystical way, as it is hidden within each person. If one does not seek it within themselves, they will never find it. This key opens the Gate of Knowledge, which complements and completes Faith. In the early days, this knowledge was given abundantly. There was great Faith, but also Knowledge, and it was this Knowledge among the few that made the Faith of the many so strong.Over these mysterious days and the inner workings of the Mystery, a veil has been drawn to hide the sacred activities from profane eyes. As a result, today, many centuries later, some foolish believers deny the existence of Gnosis. Just as their even more foolish predecessors persecuted the Gnostics of Christ and labeled them as Antichrists and the First-born Sons of Satan. This natural veil was drawn over the bright light of the Sacred Marriage when Heaven embraced Earth once more. My faith in the Master's authenticity and my assurance of His wisdom are immense. If this is considered slander against His greatness, then we are labeled slanderers alongside Hermes, a Knower of the Mystery, and are complimented far beyond what we deserve.

CONCERNING DATES

Now, let's turn to the Religion of the Mind, which is also the Religion of the Heart—for isn't Thoth the Lord of man's heart? We have diligently investigated every statement or suggestion that could indicate a date, and we haven't succeeded in precisely dating any sermon or fragment. However, we have managed to clear away many false opinions and demonstrate the insecurity, if not the absurdity, of any attempt at precision. Every hypothesis favoring a late date for any sermon has broken down. Whenever there has been a clearer indication, like in the case of the Shepherd of Hermas and the Poemandres of Hermes, it has pushed the time period backward rather than forward. What has been clearly proven is that our literature traces back in an unbroken tradition of type, form, and content to the earliest Ptolemaic times. The earliest forms of this literature are lost, but clear records of its nature remain.The existing literature includes works from various dates, though it's unclear how they should be ordered. What's evident is that some of these documents are at least as old as the earliest Christian writings. In the "Prolegomena," we've traced an uninterrupted tradition where Gnosis and Mystery-teaching were passed down through pre-Christian, Pagan, Jewish, and Christian hands. We've also shown that the Gnosis in our Trismegistic texts is simpler than that of early Christian Gnostics like Basilides and Valentinus, who were active in the early second century. Therefore, our earlier texts represent one of the main streams, perhaps the main stream, of pre-Christian Gnosis. Additionally, we've demonstrated that both our Poemandrists and the New Testament writers share a common theological vocabulary and set of ideas. This shows there's no plagiarism or deliberate copying, but rather a shared pool of knowledge. The situation and complexities involved mean that any claim of plagiarism cuts both ways; if one argues that Trismegisticism copied from Christianity, it can just as easily be argued that Christianity copied from Trismegisticism. Regarding the timeline, we are looking at a period when Gnosis and Faith were not yet separated, even within Christianity. Therefore, later ecclesiastical judgments do not apply.THE BLEND OF TRADITIONS

The view of General Christianity, which was gradually narrowed down by the Church Fathers into the dogmatic Nicene Christianity, focused on one tradition as the foundation of the Faith—the tradition of Israel as the God-favored people. However, it was the Greek language and method of thought that transformed this special belief into a global religion for many. The Trismegistic tradition was not limited in this way; it had broader sympathies. While its main source was Egypt, it warmly embraced the wisdom and genius of Greece, which were developed to teach Western nations the glory and beauty of the mind. At the same time, it did not dismiss the Hebrew tradition but did not isolate it from the rest of humanity. Instead, it valued the wisdom found in the books of the Chaldaeans, Persians, Medes, and Parthians, rather than focusing solely on the books of Israel. The spirit of the Trismegistic writings is the same as that which inspired the Pagan, Jewish, and Christian Gnostic writers of the Naassene Document, all of whom believed that there was only one Mystery that all the mystery traditions of the world tried to reveal. Therefore, if we say that our Trismegistic writings preserve the Wisdom of Egypt in Greek tradition, we should not separate that Wisdom from the Wisdom of the Chaldaeans and others. The Wisdom was one, but the forms were many; both Egypt and Chaldaea looked back to an ancient Gnosis that was the common source of their oldest Mystery teachings. And if we say that this Wisdom has come down to us in Greek tradition, we should remember that this Greek influence pertains to the form, not the substance.Where did Thales, Pythagoras, and Plato get their philosophical inspiration? Wasn't it from Egypt? The Greeks themselves unanimously agree on this. The Greeks, known for their pride in their achievements and their loud boasting of their genius, would not have credited Egypt with wisdom unless there was undeniable evidence.

However, this doesn't mean we should take away Greece's well-deserved recognition. Greece was the birthplace of philosophy in terms of systematic thinking and analytical reasoning. This is her great virtue and honor. Independent research, sharp intellectual analysis, and the beauty of clear expression were Greece’s gifts to the Western world. Greece created a sophisticated framework for thought that allowed mental analysis to flourish. Yet, this framework isn't wisdom itself, but a tool to express wisdom more clearly for those developing analytical skills. True wisdom goes beyond this type of thinking; logical reasoning is not the same as deep contemplation, and practical intelligence isn't the same as a contemplative mind. The mind, even when compared to other human abilities and powers, isn't the highest or only important aspect of a person.

Egypt had possessed this deeper wisdom, the "Secret of the Sphinx," for thousands of years. Egyptian priests could rightfully tell Solon, "You Greeks are all children," because Greek intellect was young, although it was destined to grow into greatness. Meanwhile, the ancient wisdom of the heart, known as Gnosis, existed before time and will outlast it. This profound knowledge still awaits discovery in Egypt, hidden in its symbols and sacred signs.The deeper knowledge will never reveal its secrets to those who insist on interpreting the divine symbols in their simplest forms, which are meant for children, not adults. Our ancient teachings, if they teach us nothing else, assure us of this because their authors were directly connected to the Living Wisdom of the once Great Church of Wisdom. The ancient sages understood the mystery traditions because they had experienced the sacred rituals firsthand. Personally, I trust their perspective over the dismissive arrogance of modern ignorance about the complex nature and powers within humans.

The entire theosophy of Egypt, like that of all cultures and times, was designed to guide a person toward spiritual perfection and the first true natural initiation, where he becomes a superhuman, or as Hermes would say, truly a "man" rather than a "slave of Fate." Beyond this stage are many others that are too profound for us to comprehend, and it is because of their profundity that we misinterpret them, reducing high concepts to our lowest, most limited understandings. Beyond the superman stage lies the Christ stage, and beyond that—who can speak of what transcends even the most perfected mastery?

By initiation, we do not mean preliminary rituals and instructions, but a natural process, one that the Christ of Christianity tried to teach with great wisdom, even if the records are unclear. A person can reach this initiation without a physical guide or formal ceremonies.Nevertheless, it would be foolish to say that the important mystery traditions established by wise teachers and God's Providence have had no effect. In fact, a true seeker of wisdom will study all available records of these traditions, marveling at their variety and the countless ways they guide humanity towards God. However, if someone lacks the interest or ability to study these things, they shouldn't despair. They are already in the Outer Court of the Temple if they simply lift their eyes to see the mysteries of the universe around them. We are all like babies in the Womb of the Great Mother. How long we remain as babies or embryos is up to each of us to decide. In this Birth, the Mother cannot bear all the pains alone; we must also strive, struggle, and learn to breathe within her holy Womb so that our dormant lungs can expand. Only then can the Great Birth occur, allowing us to walk into the Inner World confidently and breathe its pure air without fear.

This Inner World is not a faint shadow of the outer world, as it may seem in our current ignorance. It is the Inner Cosmos, not just the inner earth. Visions may reveal some mysteries of the inner earth, but not the deeper mysteries of Earth, much less the Divine Mysteries of the Cosmos. There is no need to label these things precisely, for even the most experienced in such visions can only know in part. In the future, we will know fully, face to face, without parables. But knowing this, who can explain the Mystery? Nature is constantly telling us this Mystery with infinite voices and mouths, yet we hear nothing.Isn't the whole creation designed to tell every person that they are made of light and life, and only happen to be separated from them, as Hermes says?

A FINAL NOTE

Some readers who have followed me to the end might say, "This man is a dreamer, an idealist; we can't use such ideas in the harsh reality of everyday life!" But I assure you, I have little time for dreams and ecstasies in the way my critics might mean. Anyone can see the effort put into these volumes, which are mostly filled with translations, commentaries, criticisms, and notes—none of which involve dreams or ecstasies, but rather hard work of the mind, soul, and body. This is what I believe to be the true practice of mysticism or, if that word bothers the reader, the Great Work of life.

It's true that discussing profound topics often leads to misunderstandings because our language can be limiting. When we call them "high" things, we don't mean they are high in a physical sense, but that they are more intense than the superficial opinions that make up our everyday world. Spirit is not superior to mind, nor is mind superior to soul, or soul to body; each must work together in harmony according to their nature and energy to form a complete person. They are not just different levels of the same thing but are interconnected aspects of each other in a mysterious way.If we consider them only in terms of quantity, we are viewing them purely as separate physical entities. If we consider them in terms of quality, we are viewing them purely as separate spiritual entities. If we consider them logically, we are focusing only on their formal reasons. If we look at them as complete entities in a unified way, we are taking an abstract approach rather than a vital one. However, they are interconnected and share both differences and similarities. Their origin, core, and destination are all found in Man, who alone can attain the knowledge of God. Thus, we can conclude with the bold advice given to Hermes by the Mind—a teaching meant for Humans.

"If you do not make yourself like God, you cannot know Him. Only like can understand like. Grow to the same greatness that surpasses all limits; break free from the physical body; transcend time; become eternal; and then you will know God. 

Believe that nothing is impossible for you; consider yourself immortal and capable of knowing everything—every art, every science, and the nature of all life. 

Rise above all heights and delve below all depths. Gather within yourself all the senses of all creatures—of fire and water, dry and moist. Imagine that you are everywhere at once—in earth, sea, and sky; not yet born, in the womb, young, old, and dead, and in the afterlife.

If you understand all these things simultaneously—times, places, actions, qualities, and quantities—you can know God."

This is the Straight Path, the Good Path, the Ancient Way.If you set your foot on it, it will meet you everywhere and be seen anywhere, whether you expect it or not—awake, asleep, traveling by land or sea, day or night, speaking or silent. For there is nothing that isn't an image of the Good. So, for now, we say goodbye to Thrice-greatest Hermes and his teachings, the Shepherd of all men. We are grateful that, by God's mercy, his voice has reached us across the ages and reminded us once more.

Footnotes:

1. The text has physically fallen out of our collection with one of the sections.
2. This seems to be a complete sermon and is referenced in Corpus Hermeticum XII. and Excerpts XI.
3. Excerpts X-XIII probably belong here as part of the "Sermons on Fate to Tat," but are assigned differently by Stobaeus.
4. These all seem to come from the same sermon or book, which, in the case of Fragment XV, is assigned by Cyril to the "First of the Expository Sermons." The beginning of the sermon is given in Lactantius XXIV, with a reference in Lactantius XIII.
5. Seems to be a complete treatise.
6. By comparison with Excerpt VII.
7. Excerpt IX is described as "the most authoritative and chief of them all," and therefore likely came at the end of one of the Books of these Sermons.
8. A complete treatise, summarizing previous sermons, probably near the end of this collection.
9. The esoteric counterpart is Corpus Hermeticum XI (XII).
10. These three sermons are too advanced to be among "The General Sermons," and in the last one, Tat is a questioner and not just a listener, as he was in the introductory instruction.
11. This is said to follow "The Perfect Sermon," which was not included in our collection among the selections of the Poemandrist editor who compiled it.The editor mentions that this is an elaboration of instructions previously given to Tat in Asclepius' absence. The teachings are very similar to those in "Mind unto Hermes" and were also included in Cyril's "To Asclepius." The end of the text is missing, with only a fragment from the conclusion of the sermon preserved.

### PRESS REVIEWS

"Mr. Mead has done his work in a scholarly and meticulous manner."  
—The Guardian

"The average student of Christian evidences, if only reading the 'Fathers,' learns nothing of these opinions [the so-called Gnostic 'heresies'] except through refutation and angry condemnation. However, in Mr. Mead's book, they are treated with impartiality and honesty. These comments highlight the unique nature of this volume and indicate that students may find it very useful for a rational interpretation of Christian thought."  
—Bradford Observer

"Regardless of the value of the Gnostics' ideas, it seems clear that these early heretics, including some deep thinkers and individuals of impeccable character, have not been treated very fairly by their orthodox opponents. Those looking to see their views treated more sympathetically than usual by ecclesiastical historians should read this excellent volume by Mr. G. R. S. Mead."  
Mr. Mead's book is aimed at the general reader rather than students, and it should not be overlooked by anyone interested in early Christian thought. --The Scotsman

The work is a product of great effort and scholarship, and it should be studied as a sympathetic view of a group often harshly judged as heretics. --Glasgow Herald

Written in a clear and elegant style, the bibliographies in the volume are extensive and will be very valuable to students of theosophy. --Asiatic Quarterly

Mr. Mead writes clearly on topics usually filled with confusing technicalities and mystifications. Even the general reader could enjoy this large volume. That says a lot for a book on such a subject. --Light

This remarkable work will interest not only the educated elite but also a broader audience eager to learn about Truth. It can be described as an extraordinarily clear explanation of the Gnosis of the Saints and Sages of philosophic Christianity. --The Roman Herald

Mr. Mead provides a complete copy of the Gnostic Hymn of the Robe of Glory and a useful summary of the Pistis Sophia, which students will appreciate. --The Literary Guide

The author, a theosophist, naturally has an interest in Gnosticism and approaches the subject from a different perspective than ours. However, this does not diminish the value of his work for readers who do not share his viewpoint. Mr. Mead has provided an excellent service, and we look forward to his future studies. --The Primitive Methodist QuarterlyWriting this book has been a pleasant task for Mr. Mead, and he has lovingly and diligently used his extensive knowledge of Oriental religions to portray Christ and early Christianity. The book is published by the Theosophical Publishing Society and naturally reflects its influence; however, it should be noted that the work shows very little of the typical Theosophic method. Instead, it is a scholarly yet deeply devotional piece.

Mr. Mead has covered a wide range of topics to achieve his goal. Essentially, his book provides an overview of early Gnosticism, written for the general reader in a style that doesn't require knowledge of ancient languages.

We are pleased that the Theosophists are focusing on the study of religion. Although we don't entirely agree with their core philosophy, we believe they can contribute valuable work if they continue to produce books like Mr. Mead's—comprehensive, interesting, and scholarly, though clearly biased. For readers unfamiliar with the detailed German works on Gnosticism, this book offers an account of its various phases and the influences that shaped it. The chapters titled 'Some Rough Outlines of the Background of the Gnosis' are well-written and highlight the philosophical and religious movements of the ancient world. The book also includes an excellent bibliography. Mr. Mead, known for his translation of the Pistis Sophia, presents here 'some short sketches among the Gnostics, mainly of the first two centuries.'Most readers, unless they are Theosophists, will find the text too lengthy. Mr. Mead's enthusiasm for the forgotten faith of Gnosticism will remind them of the saying: "The cow in the meadow, knee-deep in clover, often looks over the hedge and longs for the ordinary." Justice was not done to the Gnostics by their opponents, which is understandable. Modern scholars, like Harnack, have tried to make amends, and Mr. Mead has done his best. We recommend this book to anyone tired of Christianity and looking for something deeper than the Lord's Prayer, more sublime than Paul's hymn to Love, and more practical than the Sermon on the Mount. --The Christian World.

Mr. Mead is a sympathetic student and considers the Theosophists, of whom he is one, as inheritors of the early Gnostics' knowledge. These early Gnostics, though labeled as heretics, significantly influenced early Christian thought. Mr. Mead is as far removed from traditional orthodoxy as the men whose ideas he discusses. --The Manchester Guardian.

The work, which the author modestly calls "Brief Studies," is the result of learned and patient research, vast and profound knowledge. It is of great interest due to its subject, and it is accessible even to those who are not scholars of comparative religion or theologians, thanks to the skilled and enjoyable manner in which it is written. The author himself explains why he wrote it this way: "Because I consider this subject to be of profound human interest and not merely of academic importance." The book, published at the dawn of the new century, addresses a need of the moment, or rather, a need that has always existed and will continue to be felt, but perhaps never as intensely as in the present era. --La Nuova Parola.

PRESS REVIEWS:
"Mr. Mead is well-regarded among scholars as an informed writer on the origins of religion. His focus is on what is often termed 'occult,' a term that may simply reflect our lack of knowledge. Mr. Mead's work is careful, scholarly, and critical, yet deeply sympathetic to the spiritual ideals that transcend all creeds. This book will be very useful to English readers." --Bradford Observer.

"We agree with much of what Mr. Mead says about Apollonius." --Spectator.

"Mr. Mead's sympathetic monograph is based on a thorough study of the relevant literature. He writes with moderation and has provided valuable insights by examining Apollonius from a new perspective."Manchester Guardian: "We warmly welcome Mr. G. R. S. Mead's 'Apollonius of Tyana.' It's a book that well-informed spiritualists will appreciate and understand."

Light: "A delightful and informative little work, rich in knowledge, empathetic, and masterfully written."

The Coming Day: "The book is not only interesting but also fair and quite scholarly, even though it is light and popular in nature. The tone and spirit are commendable. Mr. Mead neither mocks what he thinks is wrong nor accepts uncritically what he believes. He carefully uses his sources and provides exact references, offering some good suggestions."

Literature: "Mr. Mead has bravely navigated through a mix of fables, debates, and misunderstandings to reveal the true man. He sees Apollonius as a first-century theosophist, initiated into higher orders and tasked with rejuvenating various cults. The author has thoroughly studied the original sources and previous works. While it's impossible to determine if he has accurately portrayed the real Apollonius, his account is plausible and may reflect the facts. Impartial readers will appreciate his sympathetic defense of Apollonius against the common accusation of being a charlatan. Mead believes Apollonius likely visited some Christian communities and met Paul, possibly in Rome in 66. However, we find it doubtful that Apollonius had any interest in Christians, unless Mead's view of early Christianity could be proven."

The Primitive Methodist Quarterly ReviewStudents of early Christian religious history owe a debt to Mr. Mead for clarifying several obscure documents from that era. His account of Apollonius of Tyana is particularly valuable because it approaches the subject without religious bias, presenting the ancient philosopher in a fresh and possibly accurate way. Mr. Mead offers a readable and well-researched account of Apollonius, examining what little is known about his life and considering, without controversy, what kind of person could have had such a significant impact on the religious life of his time. The book is full of insights into the religious life of the ancient world when Christianity was just beginning. It is highly recommended for anyone interested in the subject. --The Scotsman.

This small book attempts to tell us everything definitively known about one of history's most extraordinary figures. It is mostly done with complete impartiality and considerable knowledge. Although not entirely satisfactory, it is useful and interesting, and in the absence of something better, it can be recommended. --Saturday Review.

Mr. Mead aims to extract the few real facts from Philostratus' highly romantic narrative and present a straightforward story that matches the simple life of the humble Tyanean. He has achieved significant success in this. The book is very readable, the writing style is attractive, and his enthusiasm is genuine. Mr. Mead's latest work is thoroughly scholarly and adds a valuable page to philosophical history. --Chatham and Rochester Observer.

Mr. Mead's works are always worth reading.They are characterized by clarity, reasonableness, and moderation; they are scholarly and always written in a deeply religious spirit. The bibliographies are excellent. However, there is one issue with Mr. Mead's work. To elevate his hero's speech, he not only uses poetic expressions—which is acceptable—but also poetic inversions of speech—which are not. Additionally, he includes a whole page of irregular blank verse. Mr. Mead is capable of excellent prose, and it is unfortunate when he falters in this way. —Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society.

"This well-written volume provides a critical study of the only existing record of the life of Apollonius of Tyana. His principles, teaching methods, travels in the east, south, and west, his lifestyle, sayings, letters, writings, and bibliographical notes are all presented clearly and interestingly." —Asiatic Quarterly Review.

"The author aims to give a picture of the life and work of Apollonius based on Philostratus' biography. He does not lack sound judgment nor the necessary knowledge of the relevant literature. Although apparently a theologian himself, he remains free from the theological bias that has so early and so long plagued the evaluation of Apollonius." —Wochenschrift für klassische Philologie.

"O k. Mead writes very clearly, deals with the subject critically and with great wisdom, and provides us with the most reliable picture of the man." —Erevna.

PRESS REVIEWS

"A clear, intelligent, and interesting account of the history of the development of Biblical criticism. It is a thoughtful and learned, yet readable book, deserving attention from those interested in the subject." --The Scotsman

"Mr. Mead starts with an overview of recent progress in Biblical criticism. The tone may not be entirely ideal—'Conservatives' were, after all, defending something they cherished—but it is largely accurate." --Spectator

"Mr. Mead describes his book as 'a study in the most recent results of higher and lower criticism.' This description is somewhat incomplete, as the study is done from a neo-Gnostic perspective. Mr. Mead has shown in previous works how the captivating allure of Gnostic writings has drawn him in. Despite being mainly represented by imperfect but suggestive fragments, he has attempted to reconstruct and revive their remaining vitality. His work has been duly appreciated. He views Gnosticism as an overlooked religion that might eventually lead to a universal creed, combining elements from different faiths." --Sheffield Daily TelegraphIn his humble introduction, the author describes himself as neither a scientist nor a theologian, but as "a friendly observer, who, as a devoted lover of both science and religion, has no partisan interest to promote, and, as a believer in the blessings of true tolerance which allows complete freedom in all matters of opinion and belief, has no desire to dictate to others what their conclusions should be on any of the many controversial points discussed." Later, he strongly advises the "troubled" reader, "who fears to delve deeper into the free waters of criticism," to "leave the matter alone and be content with the creeds and rituals of the churches." Therefore, we cannot complain if he later presents conclusions that differ significantly from those generally held, even in this "advanced" age, by the average thoughtful student. He claims to address the subject "without fear or favor," and, while rejecting the "ultra-rationalism" of the "extreme school" of criticism, he nonetheless "feels compelled to largely accept the evidence showing that much in the Gospel narratives is unhistorical, and also the main positions in all aspects of Gospel criticism that do not involve a mystical or practical religious element." As a theosophist, he appears to have a special fondness, on mystical grounds, for the fourth Gospel, which he nevertheless classifies with Hermes Trismegistus. It would be too complex a task to attempt to address the details of his argument here. His conclusions claim to be based on Nestle's well-regarded work. Anyone who wants to see Nestle interpreted from a theosophical perspective should read Mr. Mead's clear and interesting pages for themselves. There are many other points we would critique if we had the space. But there are many points, on the other hand, which deserve high praise; not least, Mr. Mead's crusade against book-worship.This work is a collection of chapters that have appeared occasionally in a journal dedicated to studying religion from an independent perspective. It is read by people from many Christian churches, as well as followers of Brahmanism, Buddhism, Islam, Zoroastrianism, and those with no religious affiliation. The author believes that debates under the term "Higher Criticism" have mostly been about the conflict between advancing knowledge of physical facts (natural, historical, and literary) and traditional theological views, rather than a conflict between Science and Religion in their true meanings. 

The Asiatic Quarterly Review notes that while Mr. Mead generally agrees with the extreme critics, he does not adopt their rationalistic viewpoint. He dates all the Gospels to the reign of Hadrian and believes they were written in Egypt, suggesting a coordinated effort. He emphasizes the importance of studying Gnosticism to recover lost truths, though he does not wish to revive it. The book is written in an engaging style, but it is not considered Mr. Mead's most successful work.

The Primitive Methodist Quarterly explains that Mr. Mead's analysis of the Gospels serves as a prelude to defending an eternal "Gospel" underlying all such literature. He argues that this Gospel can be found in Gnostic writings, which the early Christian Church condemned as heresy. Although he acknowledges that the ancient forms of "Gnosis" cannot be revived, he sees the popular Evangelical doctrine of the living Christ as a reflection of the ancient wisdom of the Gnostics.Mr. Mead's teachings present Christ as part of a sacred brotherhood that includes Buddha, Krishna, Zoroaster, and other great spiritual leaders. These figures are living spiritual energies that inspire and guide humanity in its challenging quest for truth and righteousness. Readers will find much in Mr. Mead's thoughtful and scholarly work to aid in the rational and spiritual rebuilding that is the significant religious task of our time. --Yorkshire Daily Observer. Mr. G. R. S. Mead, a diligent researcher into the origins of Christianity, has recently published an excellent and instructive study on Christian philosophy. Mr. Mead is one of the leading explorers in this field, and everything he writes deserves special attention. Inspired by these sound principles, Mr. Mead has recently completed a remarkable work. --Erevna. DID JESUS LIVE 100 B.C.? An Inquiry into the Talmud Jesus Stories, the Toldoth Jeschu, and some Curious Statements of Epiphanius—Being a Contribution to the Study of Christian Origins. 440 pages, xvi. Large octavo. Cloth, 9s. net. SOME PRESS REVIEWS: "A thorough and scholarly investigation. Mr. Mead is a theosophical scholar whose previous works on Gnosticism and Gospel criticism are valuable not only to theosophists but also to theologians." --The Times. "In examining these lesser-known tales, Mr. Mead exhibits a level of patience, effort, and learning that the average person might find excessive. However, it is fortunate that the world is not only filled with ordinary people, and those who follow Mr. Mead's work will surely find it thought-provoking. These studies contribute to understanding the origins of Christianity, and their uniqueness lies in the fact that very few writers venture into the areas where Mr. Mead works with such commendable diligence."The average reader relies too much on Geikie and Farrar for these topics, and even the more skeptical student is often satisfied with Renan. For both these readers, Mr. Mead’s chapters will offer new perspectives. The reader will find himself amidst the intense fanaticisms and strange occult philosophies that surrounded early Christianity. Without understanding these, one cannot fully grasp the origins of Christianity. Mr. Mead’s readers will gain this knowledge by following his work, giving them a more complete and accurate view of Christianity’s beginnings." --The Yorkshire Daily Observer.

"Mr. Mead’s previous explorations into historical byways have uncovered much interesting information about Gnosticism and the Neo-Platonists. He seems to have been drawn to this related field, which likely contains hidden gems. For those looking for an introduction to this literature, Mr. Mead has made it easily accessible." --The Sheffield Daily Telegraph.

"Written by a declared theosophist, this book is free from any kind of dogmatism. It is a valuable addition to literature on the topic, which is both extensive and chaotic. The author has collected, reviewed, summarized, and critiqued this information, shaping it into a coherent whole. The Rabbinical and other Hebrew stories and historical details about the origins and life of the Messiah are carefully examined with appropriate reverence. The book is undeniably valuable for its insights and deserves the attention of anyone interested in Christian criticism." --The Scotsman. [p. 378]

"This book, with its remarkable title, critically examines the origins of Christianity. . . .The author is highly critical but does not impose his views and maintains a calm, philosophical approach. --The Chatham and Rochester Observer.

The author of this scholarly work is not presenting a mere theological puzzle, nor is he adding to the confusion surrounding Christian origins without cause. He has diligently studied the Talmud, and his extensive account of it is among the best in our language. His argument is characterized by great knowledge and notable humility. --The Glasgow Herald.

The question posed is serious, and Mr. Mead treats it with the gravity it deserves. --The Expository Times.

Mr. Mead has done excellent work in early Church history, presenting new ideas that will gain attention. He writes as a scholar, avoiding the theological missteps that often hinder unconventional views. --The Literary World.

All necessary materials for further investigation are included in this volume, and the author carefully balances the different authorities he cites. He has read all significant publications on the topic, showing his wide knowledge and critical insight. His work will likely be widely read by Christian theologians. --The Asiatic Quarterly Review.

This is the fifth book by Mr. Mead that we have had the pleasure of presenting to our readers.In our reviews of his earlier books, we’ve always appreciated the learning, dedication, scientific approach, and deep religious spirit that they reflect, regardless of whether we agreed with him or not. The title of the current book might lead some readers to dismiss it as eccentric speculation. However, it deserves more than just a casual dismissal. Mr. Mead has produced not just an interesting work, but a valuable one, even aside from the specific thesis he explores. —The Primitive Methodist Quarterly Review.

"I urge educated scholarly individuals to consider a remarkable book written by G. R. S. Mead. I encourage serious-minded Protestant clergymen everywhere to read this book and share their thoughts with me privately." —Standish O'Grady, in The All Ireland Review.

"A much more extraordinary collection of apocrypha is discussed in an intriguing book by Mr. Mead, known to a small audience interested in the ideas of Gnosticism. We have rarely read a scholarly book with which we so strongly disagree yet find genuinely interesting. We must acknowledge the dignified and scholarly manner in which Mr. Mead presents his ideas, even though some of them seem strange and impossible to us." —The Pilot.

SOME PRESS OPINIONS.The 'Pistis Sophia' has long been regarded as one of the most significant Gnostic documents we have, and Mr. Mead deserves the gratitude of students of Church History and Christian Thought for his excellent translation and edition of this intriguing Gospel. --Glasgow Herald.

Mr. Mead has provided a valuable service to more than just Theosophists with his translation of the 'Pistis Sophia.' This unusual work has only recently received the attention it deserves. He has included a brief Introduction with a great bibliography, allowing English readers to assess the scientific value of the only lengthy Gnostic treatise we have. --Guardian.

From a scholar's perspective, this work is valuable for illustrating the philosophical and mystical trends of the second century. --Record.

1906: Echoes From the Gnosis

## A Note from G.R.S. Mead

A series of small volumes are now being published under this general title. These are drawn from, or based upon, the mystic, theosophic and gnostic writings of the ancients to reach an ever-widening circle of those who love such things with these echoes of the mystic experiences and initiatory lore of spiritual ancestry.

There are many who love the life of the spirit, and who long for the light of gnostic illumination, but who are not sufficiently equipped to study the writings of the ancients at first hand, or to follow unaided the labours of scholars. These little volumes are therefore intended to serve as introduction to the study of the more difficult literature of the subject; and it is hoped that at the same time they may become for some, who have, as yet, not even heard of the Gnosis, stepping-stones to higher things.

The references in this volume are to the published work--Thrice Greatest Hermes: Studies in Hellenistic Theosophy and Gnosis; a Translation of the Extant Sermons and Fragments of the Trismegistic Literature, with Prolegomena, Commentaries and Notes (3 volumes)

## Volume 1

For a long time, I've spent much of my time immersed in a world of profound thought and pure emotion, created by the devotion and intelligence of an ancient theosophical fraternity. These individuals, who called themselves disciples of thrice-great Hermes, sometimes referred to their faith as the "religion of the mind." They existed before and during the early centuries of Christianity, living in Egypt. Recent efforts have made their scriptures and endeavors accessible in English, allowing me to reproduce and interpret their thoughts. After many months of work, the task is complete, and the teachings of thrice-great Hermes can now be heard more clearly in English than ever before.

The Gnosis of Hermes, praised by Zosimus as "ten thousand times great," is founded on the singular love of God. It aims to base itself on true philosophy and pure science concerning nature and humanity, making it one of the finest forms of ancient Gnosis. It is rich with wisdom (theosophia) and worship (theosibia), forming a harmonious religion of the mind. It begins with true devotion, piety, and worship, grounded in the proper activity and passivity of the mind, and leads to the Gnosis of reality and the path of goodness that guides man to God.

Am I overstating the importance of the Gnosis of thrice-great Hermes? I am merely echoing his teachings, as expressed by his disciples, translated into English. The claim is for the Gnosis itself, not the specific forms used by its followers.

All these forms of expression, including the many sermons or sacred discourses of the followers of this path, are merely tools to guide people towards Gnosis. They are not Gnosis itself. It's true that much of what is written is beautifully expressed, and I have enjoyed many thoughts and phrases handed down to us by these anonymous writers and thinkers from long ago, in the elegant Greek language. However, all this is like a garment that hides the natural beauty and truth. What's important is that all these theosophists of the Trismegistic tradition unanimously declare, with a convincing inner voice, that there is Gnosis and certainty, full and inexhaustible, regardless of how the doubting mind and false appearances might distract us.

Since I have been thinking a lot about what has been written about this religion of the mind, I want to share a few thoughts that have stayed with me from contemplating the beautiful sermons of the master’s disciples.

First of all, I feel it is a great privilege to have been allowed by the gods to pass on these beautiful ideas, even in a small way. It is indeed a great honor to help prepare others to uncover the beauties of Gnosis in their hearts, even if my role is just to translate and comment on what greater minds expressed more beautifully centuries ago. The feeling that arises is one of joy and gratitude, that such a pleasant task has been granted by God as a moment of respite, to use a phrase from Plotinus. And so, as in all sacred acts, we begin with praise and thankfulness to God, as Hermes teaches us.

When, the disciple of the master will ask, is there an act that isn't sacred for someone truly living their own life, rather than being driven by fate? For the person who is awakening, moving from unconsciousness to consciousness, and rising into life, every action is dedicated to a deeper understanding of their divine nature. This person is no longer an embryo nourished by the mother soul, but a newborn, breathing the free spirit of a greater life, the heir to the cosmic father-mind. Therefore, every action and function of the body should be dedicated to the soul and mind.

The person on this path should continually pray by dedicating each act to their God. For example, when eating, they should think, "As this food nourishes the body, may the bread of wisdom nourish the mind." When bathing, they should consider, "As this water cleanses the body, may the water of life revitalize the mind." When eliminating waste, they should reflect, "As impurities leave the body, may false opinions leave the mind." However, nothing should be thought of as inherently unclean or ordinary, for everything is made of divine substance and mother-matter. They know this deeply, but their lower nature is not yet in perfect harmony. They still see things from a single perspective and haven't realized that every perspective can be true, right, beautiful, and good.

This all-encompassing perspective is the one sense, common sense, where the sensible and the intelligible are united. It is the small mind within humans and the march of fate that create the illusion of duality. The great mind understands that the inner and outer worlds are two parts of a whole, existing together simultaneously.

In this philosophy, there is no conflict between heart and mind. It is not solely about intellect or emotion but a harmonious blend of devotion and knowledge. This union represents the true sacred marriage of soul and mind, life and light, the indescribable union of the divine masculine and feminine in the divine being, the logos, the unique creation from the ultimate mystery, encompassing everything and one, the expressible and inexpressible in eternal unity.

If you question the use of the word 'mind,' considering it may exclude other names of equal importance, remember that followers of Hermes Trismegistus have discussed this extensively. He has no single name, for he is known by many names, indeed by all names, for he embodies name itself and everything else. He is not just one entity; he is everything and nothing, if 'nothing' can indeed exist. Due to our ignorance, we call him 'mind,' because mind is what knows, and ignorance always seeks its counterpart, which is knowledge. In seeking knowledge, whether it loves or hates its mistaken perception of what it seeks, ignorance constantly transforms into some form of understanding, experiencing new things without realizing it is experiencing itself.

However, mind is not just the knower but also the object of all knowledge, for it knows only itself, as there is nothing else to know. It creates itself to understand itself, and to do that, it must first not know itself. Therefore, mind creates both ignorance and knowledge but is neither of them in its essence. The mystery itself creates all other mysteries so that it can initiate itself within everyone. We learn that the mind, the ultimate initiator, is the master of both ignorance and knowledge.

Thus, the Supreme speaks to one of his beloved sons, who has mastered himself, calling him "soul of my soul and mind of my own mind." The religion of the mind focuses on initiation and continuous improvement. The possibilities revealed to a new initiate in these sacred rites seem almost unbelievable. One wonders repeatedly, can this be true? It seems too good to be true. But how can something be too good? The master smiles and explains that the ultimate goal is perfection itself, the embodiment of good. It cannot be too good, as perfection has no excess.

We then weakly ask, what is imperfection? In the presence of the master, we realize that doubting if something is too good is the imperfection of our nature. We fear it cannot be ours, not understanding that the glimpse of this vision is not external but within ourselves. It is all there potentially, the full sonship of the Father. It is present everywhere because it is the essence of our being. The first glimpse of this divine potential is brought to the prepared disciple by the presence and glory of the master, according to followers of the religion of the mind.

But who is the master? Is he someone outside of us? Some other person? A teacher giving formal lessons? No, this isn't the case. This natural knowledge comes back to us when the time is right, as restored by God. It is not something new. It's not about becoming something new; it's about returning to what we've always been. We become what we've always been. The dream ends, and we wake up to life.

In one of the amazing descriptions of initiation from the Trismegistic sermons, a disciple is reborn or enlightened and is surprised that his guide, who helped him through this process, remains the same as ever, while the sacred ritual is completed through him. This guide is the link to knowledge. The true initiation is done by the mind, the great teacher, and this is shown in another sermon where a higher-level disciple is initiated without any physical presence of another person. Alone, he is embraced by the great presence and taught the mystery. The guide's role is to bring the disciple to unite with his true self, moving from ignorance to knowledge, and thus becoming truly enlightened.

What stands out in the mind doctrine tradition is its impersonal nature, which contrasts sharply with popular Christianity and other contemporary religious movements. The sermons are mostly given as teacher-to-student instructions. We learn to love Hermes, Asclepius, Tet, and Ammon and become friends with them. They seem like real people with distinct personalities, but they are symbolic. There is an Ammon, a Tet, an Asclepius, and a Hermes within each of us, which is why we grow to love them. These four reside in our hearts, but above all and embracing all is the shepherd of all humanity.

The divine love, conveyed through our guide Hermes, teaches us as Asclepius, Tet, or Ammon might, depending on our ability to understand the powerful words or perceive the profound insights of the teachings. However, such beautiful and truthful instruction is not the ultimate teaching of the mind. Those who are born with a mind are taught by it through every action, thought, and sensation. The mind continuously instructs a person through their body, soul, and intellect.

At this stage, the individual begins to understand through all these aspects, transitioning from a limited mind, soul, and body to a greater, more expansive self. They no longer seek a teacher because everything becomes a lesson, or rather, the one teacher imparts wisdom through everything. All things transform into the knowledge of the good for them. They become attuned to all sounds, hearing the voice of nature, the divine partner, in everything that breathes and even in things that appear lifeless, experiencing the simultaneous winter and summer of the Lord.

They are no longer just a seer, but the seer, with the ability to perceive beauty in everything, even the most unpleasant. They are no longer just a doer, but the doer, as all their actions are dedicated to the Lord, who acts through them. All their senses and energies are focused on the great work of self-initiation into the mysteries of God. Their life becomes illuminated by the glory of continuous perfection, and they no longer feel they were ever different from who they are now. Their memory is ever-present, and the memory of the mind is eternal, transcending all time and perceiving all past, future, and present in an everlasting moment.

The religion of the mind teaches us profound and joyful truths about God, the universe, and humanity. The text teaches us one important thing: that human language cannot fully convey the mysteries of existence. Each person is like a single letter in the divine language. No matter how knowledgeable someone is about the world, theology, or science, and no matter how well they express themselves, they can only convey a tiny part of the whole truth.

God's messages are written in the collective actions of humanity, not in individual words or writings. Nature's energies speak God's words, not the surface appearances of things, which are often misleading due to human ignorance. Therefore, to truly describe the universe, people must become one with it. By doing so, they will describe themselves in the same way the universe expresses itself.

The universe constantly communicates in the divine language, which is the mind of God. By using this divine mind, God continually expresses everything. This teaches us that the true religion of the mind is the religion of the logos (the divine word or reason). Throughout our texts, the name "logos" appears frequently, symbolizing the universal scripture of all worlds and all people. Thus, Hermes is seen as the scribe of the gods. Hermes is not just a scribe for the gods because they can't write themselves. Rather, Hermes represents the word of God, and the words he writes are divine. Humans are like letters of our word, or our God. We have the potential and even the reality of being divine, with a nature of knowledge, joy, and existence.

This divine word has been written in the world many times, sometimes as one letter and sometimes as another. It expresses itself in different ways, through the lives of humans and other beings. Eventually, every divine word will be fully expressed on earth, not piece by piece, but all at once. A Christ will be born, nature will rejoice, and humanity will understand or be unaware depending on the times and how the word is spoken.

These ideas come from the religion of the mind, pure philosophy, or single love, as followers of Hermes Trismegistus called their theosophy about 19 centuries ago. The most common term they used for their science, philosophy, and religion was gnosis. This term appears in almost every sermon, excerpt, and fragment of their literature that we have. The doctrine and discipline of the mind, which guides and nurtures humans, are summed up in the word gnosis.

Let’s briefly consider what the followers of this path meant by gnosis. Gnosis is knowledge, but not just the various arts and sciences known then or now.

Amidst the clamor of words, varied knowledge of appearances, and baseless opinions, true science and pure philosophy followers remained calm and resigned. Those still in training were less tolerant, dismissing such things as Greek concerns. For Egyptians, only wisdom was satisfactory. One less knowledgeable editor of our sermon collections expressed it this way: Egypt was sacred, Egyptians were chosen, while Greeks were newcomers and shallow thinkers. Similarly, Jews of that time referred to the body as Egypt, Judea as the holy land, Palestine as the promised land, and Israel as God's chosen people, continuing a game that persists even today.

However, the true authors of these sermons understood differently. For them, Gnosis transcended racial distinctions. A Gnostic was someone reborn into the community of true wisdom lovers, sharing divine kinship. Gnosis began with self-knowledge and culminated in understanding God or divine wisdom. This knowledge was different from worldly science, though the latter wasn't to be dismissed. Everything is true or false depending on our perspective.

If we are grounded in truth, we can understand everything correctly; if we err, even the truest things mislead us. Gnosis started, continued, and ended with self-knowledge, reflecting the universal self. It didn't exclude worldly science but saw all human arts and sciences as incomplete and imperfect.It is clear that the writers of the Trismegistic Tractates used the philosophy, science, and art of their time to express their insights and ideas. By doing so, they connected the profound truths of the inner life with the thinking of their era.

However, there is a risk in this approach: when we tie deep spiritual insights to the opinions of the day, we move away from timeless wisdom and into temporary beliefs. Human science is always changing, and if we present our understanding of eternal truths in the ever-evolving language of science, we might make these truths more accessible to our contemporaries. But future generations might criticize us for dressing the beauty of truth in outdated ideas, compared to their more advanced views. The documents from the Trismegistic tradition were created by many people and reflect various perspectives. Sometimes they are so intertwined with the science of their time that modern readers might dismiss them. Other times, they offer clear and reasonable insights into the truth.

Even when they are closely tied to the knowledge of their day, they remain interesting. Their understanding of living nature, despite being very different from our modern views focused on surface-level observations, might have been closer to the truth in some respects. Regardless, the teachings in their sacred texts demonstrate clear and insightful thinking. A key aspect of their discipline was encouraging students to think and question, valuing reason highly. True reason, not mere opinion, was considered the most valuable tool for understanding oneself and the universe, leading to the highest good, often referred to as the "good mind" or "logos of God."

The belief was that a person is a microcosm, a smaller version of the universe, encompassing body, soul, and mind. If individuals resign themselves to fate, they remain small, but their true potential lies beyond mere fate. Awareness is their true destiny. Humans are separate and individual, yet they are still a world unto themselves, a monad. The ultimate goal is for humans to become the "monad of monads," or the mind of God—the cosmos itself. This includes both the physical universe and the intellectual understanding of all things, the ultimate idea, and reason of God, his self-created essence.

This profound reality forms the foundation of their entire method of knowledge and understanding. The greatest mystery is the human mind, but this does not exclude the soul and body. The mind represents the essence of a person, the core presence. Time, space, and cause-and-effect are shaped by the mind, but the true self is not restricted by these limits. However, the mind often feels trapped by fate and appears as a servant to these conditions. This appearance hides its potential to become everything, to exist in every moment, every place, and every cause and effect.

In everyday understanding, body, soul, and mind seem separate. People see them as the basic elements of their existence, which is true as they form the conditions of existing outside of pure being. This incomplete state is balanced by a state of ecstasy, where one transcends limitations to unite with their true self. This ultimate state is called "pluroma" when considering space, "aeon" when considering time, and "the good" when considering fate.

True being combines mind, soul, and body as one; they are light, life, and substance, existing together equally and eternally. Therefore, anyone seeking higher knowledge must not separate these three aspects within themselves. Their goal should be to unite these parts, achieving a sacred union within themselves. This union allows them to connect with their greatest self and become one with God. Body, soul, and mind (or spirit, which is often used interchangeably with mind in this context) must work together closely to achieve righteousness.

The human body should be seen as a sacred temple, a divine shrine, the most incredible house of God, more beautiful than any man-made temple. This natural temple, created by the divine for his beloved children, mirrors the universe where the Son of God, humanity, resides. Every atom, limb, joint, and organ is designed according to a divine plan. The body reflects the grand design, embodying heaven and earth, male and female as one. However, few realize or even imagine the potential of this divine living temple. We often treat our bodies as tombs of the dead, only alive to things of death and detached from the essence of life.

The wisdom of the mind teaches us to let life flow into the dead parts of our physical nature, to call upon the holy breath of God to invigorate our bodies. This divine force can awaken our true self, our long-lost partner, and help us bring our real selves to life, becoming reborn. We strive to be a trinity of being, not just living a basic or dual man-animal existence, but achieving a perfect balance with all aspects of true manhood.

Therefore, if we follow this wisdom logically, we must aim to practice what we learn, striving to realize our full potential in every part of our being. The goal is to enhance our entire nature. We don't separate ourselves into different parts but work towards a deeper union with our true self, recognizing that our consciousness encompasses everything that we are.

Indeed, one of the most appealing aspects of the Trismegistic Gnosis, or rather its main feature, is that it is very reasonable. It always encourages the student to think, question, and reason. This doesn't mean it promotes criticism for the sake of nitpicking or questioning out of idle curiosity, but it emphasizes the proper use of purified reason. It aims to clear the mind, soul, and body so they can become a clear prism through which the pure light of the Logos, as Philo calls it, can shine brightly and clearly, reflecting the truth.

We can compare, without demeaning either, the simplicity of the Gnosis of the mind with the complex and vast revelations of the more familiar Christian Gnosis. They are two sides of the same mystery. The former is grounded in clear, philosophical reasoning, especially in Plato's logic, and stays connected to both the earthly and the divine. The latter, however, reaches such lofty and transcendent heights that it often loses itself in ecstatic visions that can't be fully grasped by the waking mind.

Personally, I enjoy trying to follow the visions of the Christian Gnosis, diving into their deep spiritual insights. However, it's clear that such intense spiritual experiences can be dangerous for anyone who isn't extremely balanced. It is very likely that the intense spiritual experiences described in some Christian Gnostic writings were meant only for those who had already shown strong self-control. The Trismegistic sermons indicate that such mystical experiences were also available to those who had attained Gnosis, but they did not share these mysteries widely. They taught their followers to be daring in their spiritual pursuits, but always emphasized the importance of practical reasoning to properly understand and use the divine knowledge they received.

For those of us who seek Gnosis or theosophy, it is wise to consider the experiences of those who came before us. Whether we call it the Gnosis of the mind, as the followers of Hermes do, or the Gnosis of truth, as Marcus does, or by any other name, the important thing is that Gnosis exists. People have experienced its healing power and overcome the inner conflicts of their souls.

According to Hermes, the greatest vice of the soul is ignorance—not of arts and sciences, but of God. This ignorance is true atheism, the root of all superstitions, and it prevents people from realizing their unity with the Divine. The awakening to this truth is the beginning of Gnosis. It brings joy and dispels sorrow.

This is the Gospel as Basilides, the Gnostic, understood it—the Son of Righteousness with healing in his wings. The Father, symbolized as a dove, represents the Father of light, watching over the sacred vessel or Divine Chalice, which symbolizes the awakened spiritual nature of the newborn Son. This is the true baptism and the first miracle, as described in the Gnosis of the Fourth Gospel, when the water is turned into the wine of the Spirit at the first marriage.

Some might argue that this is Christian Gnosis and not intellectual Gnosis. However, I would say that there is no distinction between Christian Gnosis and Trismegistic Gnosis; there is only one Gnosis. Whether it is associated with Jesus of Nazareth or Hermes, we should not separate these traditions in our minds. They complement and complete each other. They are contemporaneous and part of the same understanding. By studying the fragments of these ancient beliefs, you will see this for yourself.

Yet, some might say that we don't need an ancient faith in the 20th century. They believe we can create a new Gnosis that aligns with modern science, philosophy, and religion. I also look forward to this new age. However, I doubt the new Gnosis will be entirely new. It will be presented in new forms, as these can be limitless, but the essence of Gnosis is timeless. It is we who are constrained by space and time.

Anyone who achieves Gnosis becomes, as I've heard, the master of time and space, transforming from an ordinary person into a higher being like a Superman or Christ, or a Daemon and God, as Hermes might have said 2000 years ago, or a Bodhisattva and Buddha, as it was expressed 500 years before that.

Essentially, Gnosis is the belief that humans can transcend the dualities that define them and become consciously divine. The challenge we face is overcoming our current limitations. The way to do this is not by overvaluing our modern knowledge in science, philosophy, or religion while neglecting the imperfect traditions of the past. Relying on the leftovers of past wisdom is a poor diet for someone seeking Gnosis.

While it's true that we know more about physical observation, analysis, and classification, and we understand the theory of knowledge better, do we truly know more about living religious experiences than the great figures of the past? Do we understand Gnosis better than the ancient Gnostics? I doubt it.

We are starting to explore the greater mysteries again. I believe the cycles of time align once more, making illumination possible for many people, not just a few individuals. However, the conditions for receiving this illumination remain the same as always, one of which is the ability to rise above contemporary opinions and attain the timeless Gnosis.

To put it simply, if my assumptions are correct, the greatest illusion we need to overcome is the prevailing mindset of our current time. We must be especially vigilant against the common opinions, assumptions, and biases of today. Every era has its dominant forms of knowledge, religion, and philosophy, which are powerful because they are widely believed. It might be easier to see beyond these current opinions to deeper truths if we study forms from the past, which are no longer influenced by contemporary emotions and biases.

However, it would be foolish to simply revert to these ancient beliefs without critical thought. Doing so would be like regressing mentally and spiritually. This mistake is often made by those who take religious texts too literally, only to find themselves out of touch with the evolving spiritual landscape.

On the other hand, some might argue that in emphasizing critical thinking, we risk losing our appreciation for beauty and art. There is value in sacred texts and classic literature. It is not the number of books we read, but the quality that matters. True wisdom is found in these timeless works, and I believe there are still many who can appreciate the lasting beauty and significance in literature today.

The Trismegistic sermons share a common language with the writers of the New Testament and also use Plato's language. Therefore, they cannot be considered outdated in form. Regarding their content and main ideas, I believe they belong to the great books of the world. They are part of the world's sacred texts.

Anyone interested in the knowledge of the mind will benefit from reading what the followers of this Wisdom tradition have passed down to us. They might prefer more modern explanations or find other ancient Scriptures more suitable to their needs. However, those who love comparative Theosophy and believe that knowing only one form of Theosophy means not truly understanding it—just as knowing only one language means not truly understanding language—can learn much by comparing the Theosophy of the Hermes Gnostics with that of the Christian Gnostics, or the Buddhist or Brahmanical traditions.

In conclusion, I would like to share a few quotes on Gnosis from the Trismegistic sermons. As Lactantius, the Church Father, tells us about the Holy Scribe who inspired these Scriptures, whether we call him Hermes or by any other of his names, he wrote many books. He wrote many sermons and sacred discourses under various titles, one of them being "An Introduction to the Gnosis of the Nature of All Things." However, there is no precise beginning to Gnosis or a definite introduction confined to formal instruction. It can be presented in countless ways to the learner and listener, as it reflects its vast and original nature.

We read that for the good, there is no other shore, no boundaries, and no end. It seems to have a beginning to us, but in reality, it doesn't. Gnosis, or knowledge, is not a beginning for it, but rather, it gives us our first understanding of it. A Jewish mystic, writing just before Paul's time, quoted from some scripture of gnosis, likely one of the lost sermons from our school. This scripture explains clearly: "The beginning of perfection is the knowledge of man, but the knowledge of God is perfect perfection."

Hermes, teaching his son, the seeker, how to achieve self-realization, says, "If you seek God, you seek the beautiful. The path to this is devotion combined with knowledge."

He also outlines the good commandments, saying:

> The seeds of God are few, but vast, fair, and good. Virtue, self-control, and devotion. Devotion is knowledge of God, and one who knows God, filled with all good things, thinks godly thoughts, unlike the many. For this reason, those with knowledge do not please the many, nor do the many please them; they are thought mad, laughed at, hated, and sometimes even killed.
>
> But a devotee of God, once they have understood the knowledge, will endure all. For such a one, even what is bad for others is good for him. He deliberately refers everything to the knowledge and marvelously makes bad things good. The devotee of God is the one with knowledge, and those with knowledge stand as the original ones in gnosis.

It is especially interesting to compare this straightforward statement of fact, meant for those knowledgeable in spiritual matters, with the familiar words taken from an early collection of the Lord's sayings, meant to comfort believers. We do not know the original form of the sayings preserved by the first and third gospel writers, though we might find a clue in the Oxyrhynchus papyrus fragments. Some of these sayings, which originally circulated within inner communities, were likely adapted into a prophetic form by a Christian writer before they reached the authors of the first and third gospels.

For example, the writer of the first gospel includes one of these sayings as: "Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me." Here, the word "falsely" was probably added by a careful scribe who knew that some accusations could be true.

In contrast, the third gospel writer stays closer to the original with: "Blessed are you when people hate you, exclude you, insult you, and reject your name as evil because of the Son of Man." However, even this version seems to combine two traditions before it reached the third gospel writer.

The contrast between "people" and "Son of Man" is familiar from our Hermetic teachings and would be understood by those who knew the myth of humanity in the mysteries. This is different from the "because of me" in the first gospel. The phrases "exclude you" and "reject your name as evil" likely refer to expelling members from a community and removing their names from the list of members.

To return to the topic of knowledge, devotion is the knowledge of God. True piety is simply knowing God, as Lactantius, quoting Hermes, puts it in Latin. This kind of piety is different from religious exercises and practices. It leads to complete contemplation and involves learning about existence, understanding their nature, and knowing God. In other words, it's about understanding the nature of everything and achieving the highest vision.

This highest vision, as I understand it, is not about seeing something far beyond the sky but recognizing the good in everything. The teacher of this path instructs his student about the knowledge of the good, which is the knowledge of God, saying, "You will only see it when you can say nothing about it."

> The knowledge of the good is holy silence and a rest for all senses. It is the ultimate sense, the common sense, the sense of intelligence. For the one who perceives it cannot perceive anything else, nor can the one who sees it see anything else, nor hear anything else. This vision shines through the entire mind and soul, drawing the soul out of the body and transforming it into pure essence.
>
> It is possible, my son, for a man's soul to become like God even while still in a body if it contemplates the beauty of the good. This is the deification or apotheosis of man. He becomes like God, in that he becomes a god. The beauty of the good is the cosmic order, and the method of meditation is self-realization, which aligns the soul with the cosmic soul.

Speaking of such a soul, one truly pious and knowledgeable, Hermes writes, "But on the pious soul, the mind ascends and guides it to the light of knowledge, and such a soul never tires of praising God, blessing all people, and doing good in word and deed, in imitation of its creator."

In his external preaching, while warning people about the dangerous flood of ignorance, the missionary of knowledge and the evangelist of salvation advises them to avoid being swept away by this flood. Instead, they should use the safe current to reach the harbor of salvation. Once there, they should seek someone to guide them to the gates of knowledge. In this place, a clear light shines, free of any darkness, and everyone is sober, looking with their hearts at the one who desires to be seen. This presence cannot be heard with ears, seen with eyes, or spoken of with tongues, but only understood with the mind and heart.

From this preaching, we learn that the gnostic evangelist believed in a great association that served as a safe harbor for many. Even when safe within the calm provided by discipline, which could quiet the waves of passion and ignorance, the soul still had to embark on a further journey before the new day's light dawned.

A guide who knew the path to the spiritual sun's gates was needed, someone who possessed knowledge (gnosis) and not just faith. According to Hermes, faith is based on feelings and senses, not knowledge. Gnosis, however, is different from sense because sense is influenced by external factors, while gnosis is the culmination of science, a gift from God. While faith can help one find refuge in the harbor of salvation, true salvation is achieved through gnosis. This divine knowledge is the only true salvation for a person. It is the path to the mountain's summit, making the soul inherently good.

The virtue of the soul is gnosis, for one who possesses knowledge is good and pious, becoming divine even while on earth. In this perspective, in line with the teachings of Buddha and Indian theosophy, the soul's vice is ignorance. So, we see that knowledge leads the list of virtues. Knowledge, joy, self-control, moderation, righteousness, generosity, and truth form a sevenfold path, completed in the divine trio of life, light, and goodness.

Knowledge distributes life, light, and goodness to everyone. In a spiritual ceremony, a master dedicates his beloved son to a holy life, proclaiming, "Knowledge of God has come to us, and with it, ignorance is cast out. Knowledge of joy has come to us, and with it, sorrow will flee from those who welcome it."

Through this understanding, according to knowledge, a person becomes like the great person, embodying the good mind or reason of God. This knowledge is not only light and life, the essence of God, but also love. It is the love of knowledge, which provides light and life to all, that motivates the disciple. It is the breath of God energizing and inspiring us. It is God's foresight, the Holy Spirit.

In one of these sacred teachings called the perfect sermon, it is written: "To those who sit silently and reverently, their souls and minds focused on Hermes' words, divine love begins to speak. To be knowledgeable, we must be loving; we must have a pure love for wisdom, which is knowledge of divinity alone. This involves constant contemplation and holy devotion.

Of such lovers and knowledgeable ones, we read:

> But those who have received some of God's gift, if we judge by their actions, have freed themselves from death's bonds. They embrace everything in their mind—earthly things, heavenly things, and things beyond the heavens, if there are any. Having ascended so far, they see the good, and once they see it, they view their earthly life as unfortunate. Disregarding all things, both physical and non-physical, they hasten toward the one and only.
>
> This, my son, is the knowledge of the mind, a vision of divine things. It is the knowledge of God, for the mind is from God. Although it is difficult to leave behind our familiar habits, it is necessary if we wish to follow the path of knowledge. However, this is not a new journey or a venture into unknown lands, even though it may seem so. Entering the path of knowledge is like returning home; it is a true repentance and turning back to our original state. We must revert to the ancient ways, and for those who repent, there are promises and comforting words given by the mind itself in the gospel of knowledge known as the Shepherd of Men.
>
> I, the mind, am present with holy and good men, the pure and merciful, those who live piously. My presence aids them, and they quickly gain knowledge of all things, earning the Father's love through their pure lives. They thank him, bless him, and sing hymns, focusing on him with passionate love.
>
> One who had attained this knowledge testified, saying, "With thanks and blessings to the Father of all powers, I was filled with the power he gave me and the knowledge of the nature of everything and the highest vision."
>
> Thus, he began to preach to others about the beauty of devotion and knowledge, for he could not keep silent after becoming a knower and doer of the word. He no longer prays for himself but for the enlightenment and life of all humanity, saying, "Listen to my prayer that I may never lack knowledge, which is the essence of our being. Fill me with your power and grace so that I may bring light to those who are ignorant, my brothers, and your children.

With these brief insights into the knowledge of the mind, taken from many similar noble teachings, we conclude the first volume of these reflections on that knowledge, hoping that some readers will turn to the original sources to read, understand, and deeply absorb them.

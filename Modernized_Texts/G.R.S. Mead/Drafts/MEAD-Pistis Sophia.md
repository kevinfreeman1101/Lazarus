### A Later Postscript

- The proclamation of the disciples <page 325>## Preface

In the introduction to the first edition (1896), the translator wrote:

"When presenting this translation to the English-reading public, I must say that I wouldn't have attempted it if a Coptic scholar had taken on the task or if I knew of any plans to do so. Given the difficulty, we must minimize every possible error, and translating a translation is inherently less accurate than a first-hand version. However, I am not the first to do this. The original Coptic manuscript is itself a translation, so even Coptic scholars are working with a translation. I also believe that the anonymous and flawed French translation (1856) in Migne's *Dictionnaire des Apocryphes* (vol. i.) was made from Schwartze's Latin version (1851), not directly from the Coptic text. C. W. King, in *The Gnostics and their Remains* (2nd ed., 1887), also translated several pages of *Pistis Sophia* from Schwartze. A few years ago, Mr. Nutt, King's publisher, suggested publishing King's entire translation, but the project was abandoned. Last year (1895), I offered to edit King's translation, but was told that his literary executor felt it would be unfair to publish an incomplete manuscript.

In 1890, I translated Schwartze's Latin version into English and published pages 1 to 252, with comments and notes, in a magazine from April 1890 to April 1891. However, I hesitated to publish it as a book until Amelineau's French translation appeared in 1895. I then reviewed and checked my work against Amelineau's version."I decided to take on this project because the story, despite dealing with mystical and often unclear topics, is very simple. This means that mistakes are less likely to happen compared to a complex philosophical work. I present my translation with some hesitation, but I believe that the English public, which is increasingly interested in mysticism and related subjects, will appreciate even an imperfect translation rather than having none at all.

Twenty-five years have passed, and much research has been done on Gnosticism, including work on the Coptic Gnostic documents. Even though the first edition of this book sold out quickly and there were many requests for a second edition, I had hoped that an English Coptic scholar would take on the task. At one point, I was optimistic that this would happen. Before the War, a friend I had interested in the work completed a version of the Untitled Apocalypse from the Bruce Codex and was planning to translate the P.S. However, the War and its aftermath diverted their efforts, and the translation of the P.S. was abandoned. I haven't heard of any other translation projects since.

Given the strong demand for this book in the second-hand market, I have decided to try again. However, simply reprinting the first edition wasn't an option. Both the introduction and the translation needed to be revised based on twenty-five more years of specialized study.To this end, Carl Schmidt's excellent German translation of the P.S. (1905) has provided invaluable help, in addition to his extensive work on related documents. Schwartze's Latin translation was good for its time (1851) and is still cited by scholars today. Amelineau's French version (1895) was a slight improvement, but Schmidt's translation is undoubtedly the best. As a result, I have revised my previous English translation using Schmidt's superior work.

Schmidt is extremely meticulous throughout, and I have followed his decisions where Schwartze and Amelineau differ, generally preferring Schmidt for his consistency in phrasing. In my opinion, it will be a long time before we have a translation better than that of this experienced Coptic scholar. Not only has the translation been thoroughly revised, but the introduction has been completely rewritten, and the annotated bibliography has been updated. The second edition is essentially a new book. The Schwartze-Petermann marginal pagination, which is the common reference system and was shown in brackets in the first edition, is now indicated at the side of the page. I have also adopted Schmidt's division into chapters for easier reference and have numbered the verses of the Psalms and the Odes of Solomon for easier comparison with the Repentances and Songs of Sophia. It should be noted that the detailed paragraphing does not exist in the original, which mostly runs on monotonously without breaks.

Pistis Sophia, by G.R.S. Mead, [1921], at sacred-texts.com

INTRODUCTION

The unique manuscript of the Coptic Gnostic document commonly known as 'Pistis Sophia' was purchased by the British Museum in 1785 from the heirs of Dr. Askew and is now catalogued as MS. Add. 5114. The title on the back of the modern binding is 'Piste Sophia Coptice.'At the top of the first page of the manuscript is the signature "A. Askew, M.D." On the first page of the binding, there is a note, probably written by Woide, a well-known Coptic scholar and Librarian of the Museum at that time:

"Codex of the Upper Egyptian dialect, called Sahidic or Thebaic, with the title appearing on page 115: Pmeh snaou ntomos ntpiste Sophia--The Second Tome of the Faithful Wisdom--pages 337-344 are missing." The title "Piste Sophia" is incorrect. This form is never found in the numerous instances of the name in the text, and the suggested correction by Dulaurier and Renan to read "Piste Sophia" throughout has not been accepted. Woide, in a letter to Michaelis (Bibliography, 4), says that Askew bought the manuscript from a bookseller (apparently in London); its previous history is unknown. Crum informs us in an official description (Bib. 46, p. 173) that at the end of a copy in the British Museum of the sale catalogue of Askew's manuscripts, there is an entry: "Coptic MS. £10. 10s.," which presumably refers to our Codex--a good bargain indeed! The best descriptions of the manuscript are by Schmidt (Introduction to his Translation, Bib. 45, pp. xi ff.), and Crum (same reference). The Codex is made of parchment and contains 178 leaves, or 356 pages in quarto (8 3/4 x 6 1/2 inches). The writing is in two columns of 30 to 34 lines each. There are 23 quires in total; the first has only 12 pages, and the last has 8 pages, with the last page left blank. Overall, it is in an exceptionally well-preserved state, with only 8 leaves missing (see chapter 143, end). The writing is the work of two scribes, whose different handwriting styles are clearly distinguishable. The first scribe (MS. pp. 1-22, 196-354) wrote in a fine, careful, old uncial script, while the second scribe (MS. pp. 23-195) wrote in a more careless, clumsy hand with signs of shakiness, which Schmidt thinks might suggest the writing of an old man.The scribes used different inks and methods for pagination and correction, among other unique practices. They worked at the same time and divided the copying task fairly equally. Crum and Schmidt agree on this point but differ on the handwriting of a note on MS. p. 114, col. 2, the title on p. 115, and the last page (see pp. 105, 106, and 325 of Trans.).

Externally, the content is divided into four main sections, generally called Books i.-iv. The first section ends at chapter 62, where more than a column and a half is left blank in the manuscript. A short, irrelevant extract from another book is copied into the second column. This section has no title or subtitle. It's puzzling why the second scribe left this blank because the text on MS. p. 115 continues smoothly without interruption.

The next page is titled 'The Second Book (or Section) of Pistis Sophia.' Crum believes this title was added by the second scribe, and the short extract on the previous page by the first. However, Schmidt thinks both were later additions by a different scribe, supported by the ink color and the fact that older Coptic manuscripts usually place the title at the end of a volume, following ancient scroll traditions. Indeed, at the bottom of MS. p. 233, col. 1, there is the subscription: 'A Portion of the Books (or Texts) of the Saviour' (see end of ch. 100).

Next is a short piece on the Gnosis of the Ineffable (ch. 101), which lacks context, disrupts the sequence of ideas, and seems to be an excerpt from another book.

After this, with ch.In section 102, we notice a clear change in subject, but not in setting, from the end of section ii. This makes it hard to see it as a direct continuation. Later, in chapter 126, there's another abrupt change in subject without changing the setting, and there's a gap in the text before this change. At the end of chapter 135 (bottom of manuscript page 318, column 1), there's a note saying, "A Portion of the Books of the Saviour."

Section iv. lacks a title and is generally considered to belong to an earlier phase of the literature because of its setting change and content. Another complete change in subject happens in chapter 144 after a gap of eight leaves. Finally, on the last page, there's an appendix that starts abruptly in the middle of a sentence, suggesting it’s part of a larger work. The content, measurements, and writing indicate it wasn’t part of the original copy. At the very end, two lines surrounded by decoration are erased, possibly containing the names of the owner or scribes, or a general title.

From these clues and a detailed study of the contents, it’s clear that while the adventures of Pistis Sophia, her repentances, songs, and their explanations (chapters 30-64) take up much space, they are not the main theme of the collection but rather an incident. A scribe mistakenly labeled part of the manuscript as "The Second Book of Pistis Sophia," leading earlier scholars to wrongly refer to the entire document as "Pistis Sophia," a habit that is now too late to change. If there is any overall title derived from the manuscript itself, it should be "A Portion" or "Portions of the Books of the Saviour." Whether this title applies to section iv. is still uncertain.We have excerpts from a larger collection of literature from the same group, which consists of at least two layers. The contents of the Askew Codex are a collection or a mix, not a single, coherent work. This makes it hard to label the contents consistently. I have followed the common practice of calling the whole thing 'Pistis Sophia,' and referring to Divisions i and ii as Books i and ii, even though this is not accurate based on the contents. For Division iii, I have identified the extracts as coming from two different 'Books' (excluding a short insertion at the beginning), and the same applies to Division iv. These 'Books' are simply sections or excerpts from larger works. It is likely that our scribes did not do the extracting themselves but copied it from an existing version.

The date of our manuscript is uncertain due to the challenges of making precise judgments in Coptic paleography. Generally, it is believed to be from the 5th century, as Schmidt suggests. Woide placed it in the 4th century, and Crum seems to agree with him. Hyvernat suggests the 6th century, and Wright the 7th. Amelineau's extreme suggestion of the 9th or 10th century has been widely criticized. The Coptic used in Pistis Sophia is in pure Sahidic, the dialect of Upper Egypt, and retains many ancient features. However, it is not the original language of these extracts, which, like other Coptic Gnostic documents, were originally written in Greek.This is demonstrated by the large number of Greek words—names, nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and even conjunctions—left untranslated on almost every page, whether from the Old Testament or the New Testament. The Schwartze-Petermann Latin version keeps every Greek word untranslated, while Schmidt's German translation includes them in brackets. In the P.S., many abstract names of high-ranking orders are given, like 'Unapproachables' and 'Uncontainables,' which are not native to the Coptic language. In several passages, the translator closely follows Greek construction due to difficulties, often providing alternative translations. The fact that the text was translated from Greek is widely recognized; we now have solid proof, as one of the documents in the Berlin Codex, showing the same linguistic features, was available to Irenaeus in Greek (Bib. 47). However, Granger (Bib. 44) and Scott-Moncrieff (Bib. 56) have questioned this translation, and recently Rendel Harris (Bib. 60), after initially agreeing with the majority (Bib. 49), has reconsidered and believes the issue needs further investigation. None of these scholars, however, has provided objective reasons for their opinions. It is hard to believe that anyone who has examined the translations thoroughly could doubt the Greek origin. The entire style of the work is foreign to the Coptic idiom, as seen in Amelineau's Introduction to his French version (Bib.In his writing, he states: "Anyone familiar with the Coptic language knows that it avoids long sentences. It is an analytical language, not a synthetic one, with sentences made up of small, precise, and almost independent clauses. While some Coptic authors are harder to understand than others, it's clear that Coptic never uses complex sentences with multiple clauses that require reading to the end to understand. However, this is exactly what we find in this work. The sentences are so tangled with incidental and complex propositions that the Coptic translator often loses track and turns incidental clauses into main propositions. This strongly indicates that the book was originally written in a scholarly language." 

Amelineau exaggerates the complexity of the subject; while many passages are mystical, they are generally narrative or descriptive, not philosophical or logically complex. It's clear that the Greek originals form the basis of the Askew Codex. All attempts to determine the origin and context of the P.S. miscellany agree that it likely originated in an Egyptian setting.In other words, the 'Books' of the miscellany were all created or put together in Egypt, though we can't say exactly where. However, the Egyptian elements are not the most numerous or fundamental; they are mixed with or added on top of other elements that clearly did not come from Egypt. Determining when these were written is challenging and tied to the more confusing question of which sect the P.S. literature belongs to. There's no certainty yet; it's mostly based on accumulated evidence. An earlier theory attributed the P.S. to Valentinus, who likely died around the mid-2nd century or a decade later, or to a follower of the Valentinian school. This is known as the 2nd-century theory. Several scholars supported this view, including Woide, Jablonski, La Croze, Dulaurier, Schwartze, Renan, Revillout, Usener, and Amelineau. This earlier theory wasn't strongly supported by detailed arguments, except by the French Egyptologist and Coptic scholar Amelineau, who was its most steadfast advocate. Seven years before his 1895 translation of P.S., Amelineau wrote a 156-page essay trying to prove that Gnosticism originated in Egypt—a general idea that recent research has largely discredited—comparing the system of Valentinus with that of the P.S.

Meanwhile, in Germany, shortly after Schwartze's Latin version appeared in 1851, Kostlin's careful analysis of the P.S. system in 1854 led to or confirmed another theory. This theory rejected the Valentinian origin and generally supported what can be called an 'Ophitic' derivation. Kostlin placed the date of the P.S. in the first half of the 3rd century, a conclusion that Lipsius and Jacobi accepted.We can call this alternative perspective the 3rd-century theory. In 1891, Harnack, building on Kostlin's analysis, approached the issue from a different angle. He focused mainly on the use of scripture, as seen in quotes from the Old and New Testaments, and on the role of doctrinal ideas and sacramental practices in the history of Christian dogma and rites. He also noted some vague hints, such as a reference to persecution, suggesting that the text was written when Christians were legally persecuted. These points led him to conclude that the text was most likely written in the second half of the 3rd century. In 1892, Schmidt agreed with this view but suggested that Division IV was from an older layer of literature and should be dated to the first half of the century. This perspective has been widely accepted as more probable. In Germany, well-known experts like Bousset, Preuschen, and Liechtenhan have supported it, and in France, De Faye has endorsed it. Among English scholars, E. F. Scott, Scott-Moncrieff, and Moffat are notable supporters. The only recent challenge to this view is from Legge in 1915, who argued that Valentinus was the author. To support his claim, Legge tried to dismiss Harnack's parallels between the text and the fourth gospel, suggesting instead that they could be compilations from the synoptic gospels. He argued that only one clear parallel exists, which might come from a common source. I am not convinced by this criticism, nor do I think it is relevant to Legge's overall argument, because the fourth gospel first appeared in Valentinian circles.In the introduction to the first edition of this work, I supported the Valentinian hypothesis. However, I now believe I may have done so too hastily. Generally, the 3rd-century theory seems more likely to me now. Even if Harnack's arguments are valid, I see no strong reason why P.S. couldn't fit just as well in the first half of the century as in the second half. The question of which sect or group the P.S. literature belongs to is even more complex. Calling it 'Ophitic' is vague at best. Ophitism in Gnosticism is poorly defined, if not chaotic, due to the confusing indications from the Church Fathers. They labeled very different sects as 'Ophitic,' even though these groups never used that name for themselves. 'Ophitic' should refer to people who either worshipped the serpent or for whom the serpent played a central role in their symbolism or mythology. However, most of what we know about the views and doctrines of these groups, which the heresiologists clearly intended as a derogatory term, does not mention the serpent, which should have been their main cult symbol according to the hypothesis. The serpent is notably absent. All we can reasonably say is that we must trace our research along this confused line of heritage to discover the earliest developments of Gnosticism in Christian circles. These developments first occurred in Syria and undoubtedly had a long history, incorporating elements from Babylonian, Persian, Semitic, and other cultures. The 'Ophitic' elements in P.S. are of Syrian origin but developed in Egypt. If there is any slight Hellenistic influence, it is not philosophical. Can we, however, find any indications in the P.S. literature itself?To help us navigate the different religious sects mentioned by early heresiological Fathers, we have three general hints:

1. Philip is often described as the main scribe recording all the deeds and teachings of the Savior, with Thomas and Matthew also involved.
2. In the third section, Mary Magdalene asks most of the questions, specifically 39 out of 42.
3. In the fourth section, a particularly vile act of obscene sorcery is condemned as the worst sin.

Epiphanius, writing around 374-377 A.D., groups several sects under the names Nicolaitans, Gnostics, Ophites, Cainites, Sethians, and Archontics. These groups had a rich collection of apocalyptic writings. Among their books are references to a Gospel of Philip and Questions of Mary, both The Great and The Little. Epiphanius provides quotations from these texts, but they are obscene and clearly unrelated to P.S. Although there are more quotes from The Great Questions, leading some like Harnack to suggest The Little Questions might be different and possibly ascetic, Epiphanius makes no such distinction between them. Even if the title Questions of Mary could apply to P.S., it would be more fitting to call them The Great rather than The Little Questions. Moreover, the document Epiphanius quotes from is different in context—Mary questions Jesus alone, not with the other disciples as in P.S. Epiphanius often describes these sects as engaging in horrendous and obscene rites, which he suggests were widespread among them.The text condemns an obscene act with great severity, introducing this stern rebuke with a unique instance of strong language: "Jesus was angry with the world at that moment and said to Thomas, 'Truly, I tell you, this sin is worse than all other sins and wrongdoings.'" There is no evidence that such practices were widespread among the writers of the P.S.; in fact, it seems to have been a rare and horrific event. If we rely on Epiphanius, it would be pointless to associate the Gnostics of the P.S. with such an environment. However, Epiphanius is not known for his accuracy, and it is hard to believe in such widespread vile behavior. He also wrote this at a later date. Liechtenhan's theory that certain literature was rewritten to serve both libertine and ascetic purposes, though somewhat accepted by Harnack, seems too simple to address our specific issue. In his youth, Epiphanius encountered a libertine sect in Egypt, which morally shocked him and skewed his judgment as a historian. This led him to gather all evidence of obscenity and scandal he could find and generalize from it. Schmidt connects the ascetic Severians with the group mentioned by Epiphanius; according to our heresiologist, they still existed in the upper Thebaid in his time. Schmidt specifically refers the P.S. to them.In my opinion, it is very challenging to reconcile what Epiphanius tells us about these people, even with thorough analysis, with the main doctrines and practices found in the P.S. Without more than Patristic indications, no matter how meticulously we examine them, it seems impossible to precisely place the P.S. However, our Codex is not the only directly known Christian Gnostic document—meaning it comes straight from the Gnostics, albeit through translation. We also have the two manuscripts of the Bruce Codex in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. One of these, "The Book of the Great Logos according to the Mystery," is closely related to the literature from which the P.S. miscellany is drawn, especially with Division IV. We can confidently say it belonged to the same tradition, though it’s uncertain whether it is from an earlier or later period. There are no additional clues about its date or the name of the sect. The second manuscript, a significant apocalypse without a title, belongs to a different tradition or type of interest. Schmidt, in the introduction to his translation (p. xxvi, Bib. 45), believes it belongs to the Sethian-Archontic group, placing it in the first half of the 3rd century, rather than the last quarter of the 2nd century as previously thought (Bib. 28). His reason for this change can be seen from the following observations, which introduce us to the third existing but unpublished collection of Coptic Gnostic works.On July 16, 1896, Schmidt surprised and delighted students of Gnosticism by reporting to the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences about a valuable Coptic Gnostic Codex. This codex had been acquired in January of the same year by Dr. Reinhardt in Cairo from an antiquities dealer from Akhmim. It is now safely kept in the Berlin Egyptian Museum. This report, along with a more detailed study by Schmidt in 1907, provides all the information we currently have about this important Codex. In 1900, I summarized Schmidt's initial report in the first edition of my book, "Fragments of a Faith Forgotten."

The Codex mainly contains three original Greek Gnostic works translated into Coptic: (1) The Gospel of Mary, (2) The Apocryphon of John, and (3) The Wisdom of Jesus Christ. At the end, there is an excerpt from The Acts of Peter, depicting a healing episode by the Apostle. The Gospel of Mary describes visions of John and Mary Magdalene, though Schmidt does not detail their contents. Similarly, he only provides the introduction to The Wisdom of Jesus Christ. In this introduction, after the resurrection, twelve disciples and seven female disciples of Jesus go to a mountain in Galilee. There, Jesus appears to them as a great angel of light and invites them to ask him questions, which he then answers.

Schmidt likely shared more details with Harnack, as the latter suggested in an appendix to the report that this treatise might be the lost book of Valentinus known as Wisdom.In his work, S. focuses primarily on "The Apocryphon of John" in both of his papers, titled "A Pre-Irenaeic Gnostic Original Work in Coptic" and "Irenaeus and his Source in Adv. Haer. i. 29." S. conclusively shows that Irenaeus (around 190 A.D.) had access to the Greek original of this Gnostic text. However, Irenaeus' method of quoting and summarizing it is misleading and distorts its meaning. 

The treatise offers valuable insights about Barbelo, described as "the perfect Power" and "the Aeon perfect in glory." The system presented is philosophical and coherent. Previously, Irenaeus' clumsy handling of the text was often cited to describe the beliefs of the Barbelo-Gnostics. Both Scott and Moffat have variously attributed the P.S. to these Gnostics. Irenaeus confusedly links these Gnostics with some sects that Epiphanius criticized harshly two centuries later.

Schmidt has demonstrated that the document is actually part of the Sethian literature, and he also attributes the Untitled Apocalypse of the Bruce Codex to the Sethians. "The Apocryphon of John" shares a similar philosophical spirit with the Valentinian school. Schmidt plans to compare the two systems in detail to determine their relationship when he publishes his translation of these important new documents. The exact impact of Schmidt's work on understanding the P.S. literature remains to be seen, but it is likely to shed some light on these issues.Based on the information available, it can be suggested that while the Valentinian theory should be definitively discarded, there is no strong reason to choose the 2nd half of the 3rd century over the 1st half for dating. Scholars Lipsius and Bousset argue that similar features in the P.S. and the religion of Mani appear in a more primitive form in the former. Manichaeism emerged around 265 A.D., but its exact original form is hard to determine. The similarities between the two systems might be because they share a common source.

What is clear is that the contents of the Askew, Bruce, and Berlin Codices provide us with valuable direct information about 'The Gnosis according to its Friends,' as opposed to the heresiological Fathers' writings, which presented 'The Gnosis according to its Foes.' We now have a new perspective to review the subject and revise our understanding in many areas. The orthodox Fathers focused on highlighting what they considered the most bizarre and ethically questionable aspects of the Gnostic systems, often lumping together the good, bad, and indifferent. This new standpoint allows us to see the picture differently and potentially change our perspective on several points.This polemic had no interest in highlighting the similarities in belief and practice between the heretics and their opponents, nor in discussing the deep faith many Gnostics had in the overwhelming glory of the Savior, or their spiritual depth and high moral standards, which were often on par with their critics. While there were certainly sects with absurd beliefs and some with questionable ethics deserving of harsh criticism, the majority could not be accused of moral failings. In fact, many were strictly ascetic, and some of their ideas were quite profound, even anticipating Catholic beliefs.

When we look at direct sources in Coptic translation, their ethics appear admirable, despite any aversion to extreme asceticism in religious life, and their devotion to the Savior is boundless. This translation does not aim to provide commentary, as that would require a second volume and still leave much unclear, even with insights from experts. However, a few general remarks can be made. In the P.S., Jesus is always central and pre-eminent, revealed as the Savior and First Mystery, who knows and unveils all, infinite in compassion. He is portrayed as pre-existent from eternity, with a ministry that is both earthly and cosmic. However, he is never called the Christ, and if this is intentional, there seems to be no clear reason for it. There is also no sign of hostility towards Judaism or the Old Testament.On the contrary, the psalms and other sayings quoted are validated by the theory that it was the power of the Savior speaking through David, Solomon, or Isaiah in ancient times. The entire context is after the resurrection. 

In sections i-iii, Jesus has been teaching his disciples, both men and women, about the Gnosis for eleven years since the crucifixion. The scene now shows the disciples gathered around Jesus on the Mount of Olives on earth. The scope of this earlier teaching is seen in section iv, where the introduction mentions it happening simply after the crucifixion. In this part, the scene is different. The sacramental rite is performed on earth, specifically on the Mount of Galilee rather than the Mount of Olives. However, the scene is not limited to earth alone; the disciples are also taken to some regions of the invisible world, above and below, where they gain visions and receive explanations about them.

In sections i-iii, Jesus promises to take the disciples into different spheres and heavens to show them their nature, quality, and inhabitants, but this promise is not fulfilled in the excerpts we have from 'The Books of the Saviour.' Nonetheless, section iv is not part of fulfilling this high promise made earlier; it belongs to an earlier phase of instruction with lesser mysteries than those mentioned before. Sections i-iii reveal higher mysteries, which are now made possible by the joyous fact that in the twelfth year of the inner teaching ministry, a significant moment in the life of the Savior has been achieved: his earthly ministry is complete, and he is now fully radiant with his triple robe of glory, encompassing all the powers of the universe.He ascends into heaven in a dazzling light that blinds the disciples. After thirty hours, he returns and, out of compassion, withdraws his blinding splendor to give his final teachings to his faithful followers in his familiar form. This suggests that 'The Books of the Saviour' contain not only teachings after the resurrection, offering a Gnostic revelation that supplements his public preaching before the crucifixion, but also an even higher and more intimate unveiling within the post-resurrection teachings already known in tradition. While prior literature included apocalyptic elements and visions, more transcendental revelations were expected now that his ministry was complete. Until the investiture, or rather reinvestiture, took place according to divine command, the Saviour couldn't speak openly about all things face to face; now he can. This is the convention.

In Divv. i.-iii., a highly complex system of aeons and other elements is assumed, showing signs of stages that were once the peak of earlier systems but are now progressively subordinated. If even loftier hierarchies are to be introduced, it can only be done by demoting what was previously considered 'the end of all ends' to a lower position. This method is adopted, leading to an overwhelming list of designations and attributes of increasingly transcendental beings, spaces, and mysteries. Despite this complexity, there is no interest in metaphysical speculation or philosophizing. It is not any element of genuine Hellenic thought in the aeonology—thought to be strong in Valentinus's teachings—that has led many to speculate a Valentinian origin.The long story of the sorrowing Sophia has influenced many people. This story represents a smaller version of the 'tragic myth' of the world-soul, which is generally credited to Valentinus, although he may have adapted existing ideas. The detailed Sophia story, with its mystical and allegorical interpretation inspired by Alexandrine thinkers, has led many to believe it is crucial to the system of the Pistis Sophia (P.S.). This interest highlights the group's focus on repentance and the penitential psalms, but the focus is more ethical than cosmological. Pistis Sophia seems to symbolize the faithful, repentant soul.

The main concern is salvation and redemption, achieved through repentance, renunciation of worldly distractions, and faith in the Savior, the Divine Light, and his mysteries. True repentance is essential. The central theme is sin—its cause, purification, and the mystery of forgiveness and the infinite compassion of the First Mystery. Although there is much discussion about the spiritual worlds, the soul's journey, and the spiritual element in humans, the primary focus is on ethical teachings and the power of the mysteries of salvation. The entire narrative is framed around these mysteries, which are now understood in a more profound way than in earlier writings.On the lower level, the mysteries still retain some aspects of the tradition of powerful words, authentic and incorruptible names, and so on, although this is not specifically detailed in Divv. i.-iii. However, it is clear that the higher mysteries are now understood as the Saviour himself being the First and Last Mystery. The mysteries are not merely spiritual powers but are beings of extraordinary excellence. The light-robe is a mystery of mysteries, and those who have received the high mysteries become light-streams when leaving the body. The mysteries are closely connected with the knowledge of glory and its forms.

The lower level includes ancient astral lore, the foundational ideas of sidereal religion that influenced thought for many centuries. However, our Gnostics placed this lore low in importance. They acknowledged that astrology had some truth in the past, but stated that the Saviour had drastically altered the movement of the spheres, making astrological calculations unreliable and as random as flipping a coin.

Our Gnostics also believed in transmigration, or reincarnation, and this was an integral part of their system. They had no difficulty incorporating it into their plan of salvation, which did not show any signs of expecting an immediate end of the world—a key belief in the earliest days.Contrary to the belief that reincarnation is foreign to gospel teachings, some interpret key sayings to support this idea and provide detailed accounts of how Jesus, as the First Mystery, oversaw the rebirth of the souls of John the Baptist and the disciples, as well as his own incarnation. The P.S. offers valuable insights into this ancient and widespread doctrine, more so than any other ancient Western document. However, the element of magic is much more perplexing. Particularly in Division IV, there are invocations and names similar to those in Greek magical texts. So far, no one has thoroughly explained this complex topic, let alone its connection to the P.S. The authors of Division IV and the first treatise of the Bruce Codex valued these formulas and authentic names, which also appear in 'The Books of the Saviour.' The Gnostics clearly believed in high magic and saw value in this tradition, which they linked to their concept of the Saviour. They equated a figure named Aberamentho with the Saviour, though we don't know who or what this name referred to.In those days, they used and tried to elevate many things considered highly respectable by many, to increase and glorify the Saviour and incorporate what they thought was the best of everything. They did the same with what seemed to be the highest form of ancient magical power, which had long dominated the old world and still persisted even in religious and philosophical circles where we wouldn't expect to find it from a modern perspective. Regarding the setting of the narrative, if we weren't already familiar with many examples of pseudo-historical and pseudo-epigraphic scripture-writing, which is common not only in apocryphal and apocalyptic literature but also in some canonical texts, we might be more surprised at how the authors framed their work. It's clear they loved and worshipped Jesus with intense devotion; they were as devoted as his greatest followers. So, what kind of authority did they believe they had to set their narrative as they did? Objective physical history, as we understand it today, was of secondary importance to them; it seemed to matter little to the Gnostics of any school, and their opponents were often similar. The Gnostics were more straightforward; they strongly believed in ongoing revelation and enjoyed apocalyptic and psychic stories. The belief in post-resurrection teachings likely existed in various forms in Gnostic circles for a long time. It must have been widespread, as Schmidt recently showed.In the 3rd quarter of the 2nd century, a Catholic writer in Asia Minor felt compelled to adopt Gnostic ideas in an orthodox document that was meant to argue against Gnosticism. Regardless of how they came to their beliefs, it is highly likely that the writers of the P.S. genuinely thought they had the authority and inspiration to undertake their work. They did not see themselves as part of a declining movement or believe their ideas were inferior, unlike what many modern critics suggest. Instead, they felt they were entrusted with profound, previously unrevealed mysteries that would help them spread their message more effectively.

The P.S. was not meant to be a public gospel. Some teachings were to be shared openly, while others were to be given under specific conditions, and some were to be kept secret. The 'Books of the Saviour' are therefore considered apocryphal in the original sense of the word, meaning 'withdrawn' or 'reserved' writings. These writings followed the secretive practices common to all initiation institutions of the time. Such secrecy often leads to moral and intellectual challenges due to its inherent obscurities.

The P.S. was intended for already initiated disciples and chosen learners, though no secrecy pledge is mentioned. It was especially meant for future apostles who would spread their version of the good news. Clearly, it was the inner teaching of a fervently missionary sect.If "The Books of the Saviour" were available in their complete original form—since what we have now are only selections and the higher mysteries' formulas are missing—and if the lower mysteries in Division IV were kept from public view for fear of misuse by the unworthy, there's little risk of that today. This part of the collection is still the most difficult to understand. In fact, much of it remains unclear, even to those who have extensively studied the psychological aspects of mysticism and the general psychology of religious experiences. However, our Codex contains elements that have their own unique charm. There are pieces of rare beauty, significant ethical insights, and delicate spiritual details.

Regardless of how these diverse elements in the syncretism are judged, the Pistis Sophia is undoubtedly a crucial document, not only for the history of Christian Gnosticism but also for the development of Western religion. To help readers navigate its complex details, a basic outline of the underlying structure of the P.S. is provided:

1. The Ineffable.
   - The Limbs of the Ineffable.
2. The Highest Light-world or Realm of Light.
   - The First Space of the Ineffable.
   - The Second Space of the Ineffable, or The First Space of the First Mystery.
   - The Third Space of the Ineffable, or The Second Space of the First Mystery.

   - The Treasury of the Light.
     1. The Emanations of the Light.
     2. The Orders of the Orders.

The following bibliography is not just a list of authors and titles related to the subject, but includes notes that briefly highlight key developments in the literature and the history of opinions. There may be a few articles hidden in old periodicals that should be added to complete the list, but if they were important, they would have been cited by later writers.

**Annotated Bibliography**

1. 1770: Article in British Theological Magazine (?). See Kostlin below, entry 13.
2. 1773: Woide (C. G.). Article in Journal des Savants (Paris).
3. 1778: Woide (C. G.). Article in J. A. Cramer's Contributions to the Promotion of Theological and Other Important Knowledge (Kiel and Hamburg), vol. 3, pp. 82 ff. Woide edited the New Testament according to the Codex Alexandrinus in 1786, using uncial types to mimic the manuscript. In an appendix to this major work in 1799, he included fragments of the New Testament in the Thebaic-Coptic dialect and a dissertation on the Coptic version of the New Testament. The Codex Alexandrinus is generally dated to the 5th century and, aside from the Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus (sometimes dated to the 4th century), is the oldest existing manuscript of the New Testament.Given this context, it's worth quoting from W.'s thoughts on the date of the manuscript of P.S., which was lent to this diligent scholar by Dr. Askew and which he copied from beginning to end:

"P.S. is a very old manuscript in quarto format on parchment, written in Greek uncial letters. These letters are less rounded than those in the Alexandrine Manuscript in London and the Claromontanus Manuscript in Paris. The letters in the P.S. manuscript are somewhat longer and more angular, so I believe it is older than both of those manuscripts, where the letters eta, theta, omicron, rho, and sigma are much rounder." Thus, W. dates the manuscript to the late 4th century. 

In 1794, Buhle (J. G.) published "Literary Correspondence of Johann David Michaelis" (Leipzig) in three volumes. On page 69 of the third volume, dated 1773, there's a letter from Woide to Michaelis, stating that Askew found the P.S. Codex by chance in a bookshop. The letter also includes a description of the manuscript.

In 1799, Woide (C. G.) published an appendix to the edition of the Greek New Testament from the Alexandrine Manuscript, including a dissertation on the Egyptian Bible versions and a comparison with the Vatican Codex (Oxford, p. 137). Woide dates the P.S. Codex to around the 4th century and believes the original Greek author was Valentinus.

In 1812, Munter (F.) published "Gnostic Odes Attributed to Solomon," in both Thebaic and Latin, with a preface and philological notes (Hafniae). Bishop Munter, a knowledgeable Dane, probably obtained his text from Woide's copy. Although his brief pamphlet isn't particularly significant, scholars based their opinions of the P.S. solely on these few selections—the five Odes of Solomon—until Schwartze's translation was published in 1851. Munter believed the original work dated back to the 2nd century.For information on the Odes of Solomon, see entries 49, 53, and 60.

7. In 1838, Dulaurier (E.) wrote an article in Le Moniteur on September 27.

8. In 1843, Matter (J.) published "Histoire Critique du Gnosticisme et de son Influence sur les Sectes religieuses et philosophiques des six premiers Siècles de l'Ère chrétienne" in Paris, 2nd edition, volumes ii. 41 ff., 350 ff. The first edition, published in 1828, does not mention P.S. Dorner's German translation refers to ii. 69 ff. and 163 ff. Matter rejects the authorship of Valentinus, although he relies heavily on Woide. He vaguely dates the original treatise between the late 2nd century and the late 5th century but does not specify the school to which it belongs (p. 352).

9. In 1847, Dulaurier (E.) wrote an article in the Journal Asiatique, 4th series, volume ix., June, pages 534-548, titled "Notice sur le Manuscrit copte-thébaïn, intitulé La Fidèle Sagesse; et sur la Publication projetée du Texte et de la Traduction française de ce Manuscrit." Dulaurier had prepared a translation of the P.S. He stated: "The translation of the Pistis Sophia and the accompanying glossary are finished and will be sent to the printers once I ensure that I have met the requirements of this task, considering the current state of science and my own capabilities. The manuscript I used for my translation is a copy I made from the original during my stay in England in 1838-1840, when I was commissioned by MM. de Salvandy and Villemain, successive ministers of public instruction, to study this significant document in London." (p. 542). However, Dulaurier did not publish his work, and I have not found any record of what happened to his manuscript. He attributes the treatise to Valentinus.

10. In 1851, Schwartze (M. G.) published "Pistis Sophia, Opus Gnosticum Valentino adjudicatum, e Codice Manuscripto Coptico Londinensi descriptum."In 1848, M. G. Schwartze made a copy of the Codex in London but died before he could finish his work on the P.S. He left behind a manuscript translation with many blanks and passages he had intended to complete and correct. His friend, J. H. Petermann, only made verbal corrections and suggestions for different readings in his notes. As a result, we have a translation without the translator's notes or an introduction. Petermann mentioned that the editing task was so challenging that it often made him dizzy. Despite its many flaws, this first edition is considered 'an outstanding achievement.'

Schwartze believed the original treatise was written by Valentinus, as indicated by the title of his work. However, Petermann thought it was written by an Ophite and promised to explain his reasons in a treatise that, unfortunately, was never published. A review of Schwartze's work appeared in the Journal des Savants in 1852 (p. 333).

In 1852, Bunsen (C. C. J.) published "Hippolytus and his Age" in London, where he discussed his hopes in 1842 that an ancient Coptic manuscript in the British Museum, titled "Sophia," might be a translation or extract from a lost Gnostic text mentioned by Hippolytus. However, after reviewing Schwartze's manuscript, Bunsen concluded that it was a worthless offshoot of the Marcosian heresy, filled with nonsensical mysticism about letters, sounds, and words.The Marcosian theory has been partially revived by Legge (see below, p. 57), but no one else supports it. We doubt whether B. could have read Schwartze's manuscript carefully. 

In 1853, Baur (F. C.) wrote "Das Christenthum and die christliche Kirche der drei ersten Jahrhunderte" (Tubingen), with notes on pages 185, 186, and 205, 206. Baur likely added these notes just before publication. On page 206, he suggests an Ophite origin.

In 1854, Kostlin (K. R.) wrote two articles in Baur and Zeller's "Theologische Jahrbucher" (Tubingen), vol. xiii, pages 1-104 and 137-196, titled "Das gnostische System des Buches Pistis Sophia." Kostlin was the first to thoroughly analyze the contents of the treatise, focusing on the system of "Pistis Sophia." His work was later used by Lipsius in an article in Smith and Wace's "Dictionary of Christian Biography" (see below, p. 20). Kostlin dates the work to the first half of the 3rd century and believes it has an Ophite origin. In a note on page 1, Kostlin writes:

"The manuscript from which the work is published belongs to the collection gathered by Dr. Askew of London during his travels in Italy and Greece. The British Theological Magazine (Das Brittische theol. Magazin) for 1770 (vol. i, part 4, p. 223) provides more details." 

We know nothing about these travels, and there is no such magazine in the British Museum's catalog. The Theological Repository for 1770 contains no information on the topic, and no permutation of names solves the mystery. Few magazines were published at that time, so the options are limited.

In 1856, an anonymous translation was included in Migne's "Dictionnaire des Apocryphes," tom. i, appendix part ii, coll. 1181-1286; this volume forms vol. xxiii of his third "Encyclopedie Theologique."The translation is poorly done, often just a paraphrase of Schwartze's version rather than a proper translation. It also frequently omits large sections, sometimes as many as 40 pages from Schwartze's text, such as pages 18, 19, 36 and following, 50, 51, 72, 73, 86-90, 108-135, 139, 157-160, 162, 171, 179, 180, 184-186, 221-243, 245-255, 281-320, and 324-342. These are just some examples; there are many more. Thus, it is completely useless for students. The anonymous writer vaguely suggests a late date for the treatise due to its complex system. 

In 1860, Lipsius (R. A.) wrote an article 'Gnosticismus' in Ersch and Gruber's Encyclopaedia, which was also published separately in Leipzig. He considers the P.S. an Egypto-Ophite treatise and, with Kostlin, dates it to the first half of the 3rd century. See his article in the Dictionary of Christian Biography (1887).

From 1875-1883, the Palaeographical Society published facsimiles of manuscripts and inscriptions in their Oriental Series, edited by William Wright (London). Plate xlii includes a careful analysis of the text from a technical standpoint, placing the original manuscript in the 7th century, post-Valentinus. The facsimile is of folio 11a.

In 1877, Jacobi (H.) wrote an article 'Gnosis' in Herzog's Theological Real Encyclopaedia (Leipzig), 2nd edition in 1888, with translations in New York in 1882 and 1883. Jacobi believes in an Ophite origin.

In 1887, King (C. W.) published the second edition of "The Gnostics and their Remains, Ancient and Medieval" (London). The first edition appeared in 1864 but did not reference P.S. King considers the P.S. the most precious relic of Gnosticism. This volume includes many references and translations from Schwartze's pages 227-239, 242-244, 247-248, 255-259, 261-263, 282-292, 298-308, 341, 342, 358, and 375. King does not speculate on the date or author.**Essay on Egyptian Gnosticism, its Developments, and its Egyptian Origin, in Annals of the Guimet Museum (Paris), vol. xiv. See the third part for the systems of Valentinus and of P.S., pp. 166-322. 20. 1887. Lipsius (R. A.).

Of importance is L.'s suggestion that P.S. may be one of the indirect sources of the Manichaean religion. In any case,

[p. lvii]

[paragraph continues] "it is probable that the book Pistis Sophia was written before the Manichaean system, therefore before A.D. 270.

Practically the Introduction to his publication of the Text and Translation of the Bruce Codex (24, below). In it, A. presents the results of "the researches and studies, the hypotheses and convictions of seven years" of work (p. 4 offprint). 24. 1891. Amelineau (E.).Notice about the Bruce Gnostic Papyrus, Text and Translation, in Notices and Extracts from Manuscripts in the National Library and Other Libraries (Paris), vol. 29, part 1, pages 65-305. These views have faced strong criticism, particularly by Schmidt (see below, pages 25-28). 

Harnack (A.), in his 1891 study "Über das gnostische Buch Pistis-Sophia" (Leipzig) (Texte und Untersuchungen, vol. 7, part 2, 144 pages), provides a significant analysis of early Christian literature and the development of dogma. He carefully analyzes the Latin version of Schwartze and gives several reasons for dating the "Pistis Sophia" (P.S.) to the second half of the 3rd century. Harnack's work is particularly valuable for its analysis of Biblical references in the P.S., especially its use of the New Testament, and for evaluating the development of general Christian and Catholic elements in the text. He suggests that Division III should be called "Questions of Mary" (pages 94, 108).

Unbeknownst to Harnack, Renan (in "Marc Aurèle," page 120) had already proposed that the entire P.S. might be identical with the "Little Questions of Mary" mentioned by Epiphanius. However, Renan shows (page 145) that he lacks direct knowledge of the subject. Harnack associates the P.S. with an 'Ophitic' sect, but not the 'Ophites' in the strict sense, as there is no evidence of serpent worship (page 110). He connects the P.S. sect closely with the Syrian Ophitic group, which had branches in Egypt, and investigates Epiphanius's statements, which Schmidt examines in greater detail in his edition of the Codex Brucianus (see below, page 28). These two scholars have collaborated closely on the P.S., focusing on its origin, date, and place.H.'s final comment on the overall religious significance of the P.S.—specifically its relevance to Early Christian and Catholic religion and its place in the history of Christianity—is notable. On page 114, he writes: "In this context, the P.S. is an extremely important document because no other work so clearly illustrates the early history of Catholic sacramentism. What the Gnostics achieved suddenly and clearly at the end of the third century, the Catholic Church accomplished slowly and with great effort in the following century. This Gnosticism is not the precursor of Catholicism but rather an older sibling who achieved by force what the younger sibling later attained through many challenges."

In 1891, Schmidt (C.) wrote a highly critical review of Amelineau's edition of the Bruce Codex in the Gottingische Gelehrte Anzeigen (Gottingen), issue xvii, pages 640-675. In the same year, Amelineau (E.) responded to Schmidt's criticisms in an article titled 'Le Papyrus Bruce: Reponse aux Gottingische Gelehrte Anzeigen' in Revue de l'Histoire des Religions (Paris), volume xxiv, number 3, pages 376-380. In 1892, Schmidt (C.) replied further in the Gottingische Gelehrte Anzeigen (Gottingen), issue 6, pages 201-202. Later in 1892, Schmidt published a masterful edition titled "Gnostische Schriften in koptischer Sprache aus dem Codex Brucianus" (Leipzig), which completely surpassed Amelineau's work based on Woide's copy of the disorganized manuscript in the Bodleian Library. Schmidt's detailed analysis revealed that the chaos could be organized into two completely different manuscripts. The larger work is titled "The Book of the Great Logos according to the Mystery," and its contents naturally divide into two sections, which Schmidt refers to as 'The First' and 'The Second Book of Jeu.' This system is closely related to that of the P.S. miscellany. Schmidt dedicates pages...In his thorough study of this relationship, S. makes a valuable contribution by analyzing the contents of the P.S. His efforts serve as an introduction to his later translation of the P.S. in 1905. He provides a detailed examination of the P.S. system, which improves upon Kostlin's earlier work from 1854. S. believes that the P.S. is a compilation of other works, a view Kostlin had already suggested. He dismisses objections about the 'Two Books of Yew' mentioned in the P.S. being dictated to Enoch by Jesus before the Flood and hidden away, while the first document of the C.B. is revealed by Jesus to the disciples. The statement in the P.S. aligns with common apocalyptic claims, and the sect did have two Yew Books. The contents of C.B. I. match what we expect from P.S. references, and the connection between P.S. Div. iv. and C.B. I.b is obvious. S. agrees with Harnack on the date of the P.S., placing Divv. i.-iii. in the latter half of the 3rd century and Div. iv. a few decades earlier. Thus, C.B. I. is placed in the first half of the 3rd century. C.B. II., a work without a title, excites S. and appears to be earlier, around 160-200 A.D., though S. later revised his opinion on the date. After a detailed investigation, especially scrutinizing Epiphanius's statements, S. concludes that the Severians are most likely the sect responsible for the writings in P.S. and C.B.The following text can be simplified and converted into modern English without losing its original meaning:

I. This can be attributed (p. 596). C.B. II., he concludes, may be linked to the Sethian-Archontics (p. 659). The whole issue becomes very complex when specific names are involved. It is important to note that in his research,

S. uses his previous work on the challenging problem of the Gnostics of Plotinus, in his treatise "Plotin's Position on Gnosticism and Church Christianity" (Leipzig, 1900, 168 pages, T. u. U. N.F. v. 4.). There is significant criticism of Amelineau's work and views scattered throughout this C.B. volume.

This version maintains the original references and essential details while simplifying the language for modern readers.In the Coptic-Gnostic Codex Brucianus, the "Two Books of Jeu" are discussed in relation to the Pistis Sophia in the journal *Zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche Theologie* (Leipzig), volume 37, pages 555-585. This includes S.'s response to P.'s criticism in 1895.

Amelineau (E.) translated the Pistis Sophia, a Gnostic work attributed to Valentinus, from Coptic into French, with an introduction (Paris), 32 + 204 pages. Amelineau strongly supports the idea that the treatise has a Valentinian origin and leans heavily towards an Egyptian origin of the ideas. These views have faced severe criticism, particularly from Schmidt. 

However, regarding the manuscript itself, Amelineau dates it very late, writing the following on page xi of his Introduction: "After examining the numerous errors made by the scribe, I cannot date the manuscript that preserved the Pistis Sophia to us later than the ninth or tenth century, at the latest. I have several reasons for this. Firstly, the manuscript is written on parchment, which was rarely used in Egypt before the sixth or seventh century. Secondly, the writing, which is uncial, though decent in the first pages, becomes substandard in many leaves, showing the scribe's fatigue; it is no longer the beautiful writing of the great periods of Egyptian scribes but sloppy, inconsistent, almost round, and hurried. Thirdly, the spelling errors in the use of Greek words clearly show that the scribe belonged to a period when Greek was almost no longer known."

In a footnote, Amelineau acknowledges that his opinion will 'raise a storm' and asks for judgment to be suspended until he has published his reasons, especially regarding the late use of parchment, in more detail. The storm did indeed break, and no one has accepted Amelineau's arguments.Among other things, he failed to notice that the Askew Codex was created by two scribes, not just one, and that the different parts of their work can be clearly attributed to each scribe. As far as I know, the parchment argument has never been made public. 

In 1896, G. R. S. Mead published "Pistis Sophia: A Gnostic Gospel" in London. This was the first time it was translated from Greek into Coptic and then into English from Schwartze's Latin version, compared with Amelineau's French version.

In 1898, C. Schmidt published a critical review of Amelineau's introduction to his translation of "Pistis Sophia" in the Gotting. Gelehrte Anzeigen (Gottingen).

In 1899, W. E. Crum provided a description of the manuscript of "Pistis Sophia" in the Egyptian Exploration Fund's Archaeological Reports for 1897/1898 (London), but this was later improved upon.

In 1900, G. R. S. Mead published "Fragments of a Faith Forgotten" in London. The first edition included summaries and notes on various Gnostic texts, including the Askew and Bruce Codices, the contents of the Pistis Sophia treatise, extracts from the Books of the Saviour, selections from the Untitled Apocalypse of the Codex Brucianus, and the Akhmim Codex (now known as the Berlin Codex).

In 1901, A. Rahlfs published "Die Berliner Handschrift des sahidischen Psalters" in Berlin. He noted a significant difference in the versions of the Psalms quoted in the Pistis Sophia text.The text varies only slightly from the usual Sahidic version, but the sections on pages 86-110 are so different that they must be an independent translation from the Greek. If this is the case, it is highly likely that Repentances 8-13 were added later, and originally there were only 7 Repentances. If this hypothesis is correct, it is important for analyzing the literature internally. R.'s view is criticized by Rendel Harris.

In 1901, Liechtenhan (R.) published 'Investigations into Coptic-Gnostic Literature' in the Journal of Scientific Theology, Volume 44, Issue 2, pages 236-253. In his analysis of the P.S. composition, L. introduces a new idea. He believes that pages 128 (chapter 64) to 175 (end of chapter 80), which come after the thirteen Repentances, were added later to the Sophia episode. He sees the opening lines of chapter 81 ("It came to pass after all this") as a connecting paragraph added by an editor. 

Regarding the suggested titles 'The Questions of Mary' for Division 3 and 'The Gospel of Philip' (P.S. chapter 42) as a possible title for Divisions 1 and 2, he tries to resolve the issue that these titles are mentioned by Epiphanius among the books of a group of sects which the Church Father describes as having the most vile, blasphemous, and obscene rites, with the following conjecture: A Gnostic sect in Egypt had a rich, apocalyptic literature, including a Gospel of Philip and Questions of Mary. This sect was divided into an ascetic and a libertine branch, and each group reworked the sacred literature they inherited. Epiphanius (Haer. xxvi.) got hold of the libertine version; the ascetic version is preserved for us in P.S., Divisions 1-3. Division 4 is an earlier layer. 'The Books of Yew' are mentioned in P.S.It is believed that these texts were revealed to Enoch. Therefore, like Preuschen, he thinks that these cannot be the treatise from the Bruce Codex to which Schmidt has given this title, because the latter is revealed to the Disciples (p. 251).

In 1904, Harnack (A.) published "Die Chronologie der altchristlichen Literatur" (Leipzig), vol. II, pp. 193-195, discussing "Die Pistis Sophia" and the Gnostic writings contained in Papyrus Brucianus from the 5th or 6th century. Harnack reiterates from his detailed study (mentioned earlier, 24a) his reasons for dating the contents of P.S. Divv. i.-iii. to the latter half of the 3rd century. He says that Liechtenhan's final opinion (mentioned earlier, 41) on the 'The Questions of Mary' issue is close to his view. However, Harnack does not explain why he dates the Bruce Codex treatises to the 5th or 6th century.

In 1904, Liechtenhan (R.) wrote an article on 'Ophiten' in Schaff-Herzog's Real-Encyclopaedia of Protestant Theology, 3rd edition, vol. xiv. Liechtenhan (p. 405) includes the P.S. among many sects he categorizes under the broad heading of 'Ophites.' A shortened version of this appears in "The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopaedia of Religious Knowledge" (New York), 1910, vol. viii.

In 1904, Granger (F.) wrote an article on "The Poemandres of Hermes Trismegistus" in The Journal of Theological Studies (London), vol. v, pp. 395-412. Granger (p. 401) questions whether the P.S. is a translation from Greek, but his only reason is the speculative statement that, "The Egyptian Gnostic writings of the third century exhibit the same qualities of style as the Coptic biographies and apocalypses of the fourth and following centuries."

In 1905, Schmidt (C.) published "Koptisch-gnostische Schriften." Volume I includes "Die Pistis Sophia," "Die beiden Bucher des Jeu," and an unknown ancient Gnostic work (Leipzig), xxvii + 410 pages. Volume II is set to contain three unpublished works from the Berlin Codex titled: (1) The Gospel of Mary; (2) The Apocryphon of John; (3) The Wisdom of Jesus Christ.For a summary of Schmidt's notice of the Codex, see my book, "Fragments of a Faith Forgotten," 2nd edition, London, 1906, pages 579-592. Schmidt's notice was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences, Berlin, 1896, pages 839 and following, titled "An Original Pre-Iranian Gnostic Work in Coptic Language." The long-anticipated second volume has not yet been published. The content is valuable because the Apocryphon of John in its original Greek was available to Irenaeus. In an appendix to Schmidt's notice, Harnack asks if The Wisdom (Sophia) of Jesus Christ might be the lost famous writing of Valentinus. In the Introduction (pages ix-xviii), Schmidt summarizes the results of his previous studies. The translation of the P.S. occupies pages 1-254 and is highly praised.

In 1905, W. E. Crum's "Catalogue of the Coptic Manuscripts in the British Museum" (London), page 173, provides the official British Museum description of the Askew Codex.

In 1907, Schmidt wrote an article titled "Irenaeus and His Sources in Against Heresies I. 29," published in Philotesia, a collection of studies in honor of Paul Kleinert's 70th birthday, pages 317-336. This important study discusses the Apocryphon of John in the unpublished Coptic Gnostic Berlin Codex. Schmidt had previously reported the contents of this Codex to the Prussian Academy in 1896. The Greek original is early, and Irenaeus had a copy. This allows us to evaluate Irenaeus's method of quoting and summarizing, which is shown to be unreliable. Schmidt assigns this document to a Sethian group in Egypt and connects its aeon-lore to Valentinian ideas. Unfortunately, he does not discuss how this document and the other two in the Codex—The Gospel of Mary and The Wisdom of Jesus Christ—relate to the development of the P.S. doctrines.It seems he is saving his discussion on the topic for his much-anticipated edition of the entire Berlin Codex. This edition will provide us with firsthand knowledge of second-century Gnosticism for the first time. Based on the little that S. has already revealed, it will shed significant light on some of the most confusing aspects of the history of Gnostic doctrine development.

48. 1907. Bousset (W.). Hauptprobleme der Gnosis (Göttingen), 398 pages. This is a highly valuable study from a comparative perspective. Although Lipsius (see above, 20) had already highlighted the point, Bousset goes further by showing in detail the close connection between some main ideas of the Manichaean religion and certain features of the P.S. Schmidt (1892, pages 375, 404, 417, 564) had previously pointed out isolated parallels only. 

In discussing the system of the P.S. (pages 346-350), Bousset writes: "There is no doubt at all about the similarity between the two systems. The only remaining question is whether the P.S. and II. Jeu directly depend on the Manichaean system, or whether both systems share a common source. For now, I find the latter more likely. Many related ideas appear in the P.S. in a more original and pure form. The figure of the Virgin of Light is significant in the P.S., whereas in the Manichaean system, she is a minor figure alongside the Third Envoy. If this latter hypothesis is correct, Mani would have considerably less claim to originality for his system than previously thought."

49. 1909. Rendel Harris (J.). The Odes and Psalms of Solomon, now first published from the Syriac Version (Cambridge). This is the first edition of the now recovered 42 Odes; previously, only five were known in the P.S. Rendel Harris dedicates pages 16-35 to discussing the use of the Odes in the P.S.On page 35, he writes: "The Pistis Sophia, which includes the Odes, dates back to the third century. The author of the Pistis had, as we have shown, included the Odes with his Canonical Psalter. At that time, there was no Coptic [Thebaic] Bible from which the extracts could have been taken. Therefore, we can be sure the Odes were taken from a Greek Bible, and almost certainly, the Pistis Sophia itself was originally a Greek book." For R. H.'s change of opinion, see below, 60. 

50. 1909. Arendzen (J. P.). Article 'Gnosticism,' in The Catholic Encyclopaedia (New York), vol. vi. Pistis Sophia is briefly and inadequately discussed on page 600. 

51. 1910. Bousset (W.). Article 'Gnosticism,' in Encyclopaedia Britannica (London), 11th edition. Bousset, following the common German view, dates Pistis Sophia to the second half of the third century. He believes both treatises in the Bruce Codex are later than Pistis Sophia but does not argue this point further. [page lxvi]

52. 1912. Bousset (W.). Articles 'Gnosis' and 'Gnostiker,' in Paulys Real-Encyklopädie der klassischen Altertumswissenschaft (edited by Wissowa-Kroll, Berlin). In section 10, Bousset discusses Pistis Sophia and the Bruce Codex as products of a period when Gnosticism had become unruly ('Die Verwilderung der Gnosis'). He does not repeat his view on the later date of the Bruce Codex but notes that the eschatology in Pistis Sophia strongly resembles Valentinian thought. 

53. 1912. Worrell (W. H.). Article 'The Odes of Solomon and the Pistis Sophia,' in The Journal of Theological Studies (London), volume xiii, pages 29-46. An interesting study that includes translations of five Odes from Coptic and Syriac. Worrell criticizes R. Harris for using Schwartze's Latin version instead of Schmidt's more modern translation in his quotations from Pistis Sophia.

54. 1913. Scott (E. F.). Article 'Gnosticism,' in Hastings' Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics (Edinburgh), volume vi, pages 231-242. "There can be little doubt that the Coptic writings (Pistis Sophia, etc.)..."The text discusses various scholarly opinions on the Barbelo-Gnosis and the Pistis Sophia (P.S.), a Gnostic text. Written in Egypt at the end of the 3rd century, P.S.'s exact dating is uncertain until Schmidt's complete translation and commentary on "The Apocryphon of John" are available.

In 1913, E. De Faye's work, "Gnostiques et Gnosticisme," critically examines Christian Gnostic documents from the 2nd and 3rd centuries. De Faye agrees with Harnack and Schmidt that P.S. likely dates to the latter half of the 3rd century. He suggests that Division III of P.S. might be the lost "Little Questions of Mary," supporting Harnack's view against Schmidt, who had initially agreed but later changed his mind. De Faye argues that Schmidt successfully defended his position on the two Jell Books against Preuschen and Liechtenhan's doubts.

De Faye opposes the idea that P.S. originated from Valentinianism and criticizes both the general Ophite theory and Schmidt's specific Severian theory. Although he does not propose a specific origin, De Faye suggests that most Gnostic systems, including P.S., are later and degenerate forms of earlier, more metaphysical systems like those of Basilides, Valentinus, and Marcion. He believes metaphysical interpretations are secondary and that Gnosticism began with strong mythological and apocalyptic ideas.

In the same year, P. D. Scott-Moncrieff's book "Paganism and Christianity in Egypt" includes a chapter on aspects of Gnosticism, particularly focusing on Pistis Sophia.After reviewing the contents and literature, the author notes (p. 175): "If the work is of Syrian origin, it shows clear signs of Egyptian influence. The fact that it was important enough to be translated into the local language proves that the sect behind it was an Egyptian group living in Egypt." This is generally accepted. However, S.-M. suggests that the significance of the translation might be overstated. Without justifying his opinion, he states that "the Coptic text is at the earliest a fifth-century work, a time when Gnosticism was declining and could only be practiced secretly." It seems the author might be confusing the date of the Askew Codex copy with that of the original text.

In 1915, Legge (G. F.) published "Forerunners and Rivals of Christianity: Being Studies in Religious History from 330 B.C. to 330 A.D." (Cambridge), 2 volumes. Chapter x., titled 'The System of the Pistis Sophia and its Related Texts,' discusses various divisions. Divisions i. and ii. suggest a system similar to those of the Ophites and Valentinus (p. 135), while Divisions iii. and iv. are likely Marcosian in origin (p. 173) and later than Divisions i. and ii. (p. 184). In this, Legge partially revives Bunsen's previously rejected theory. He supports the idea of a Greek original and adds (p. 177): "We must look for an author who, though Egyptian and familiar with native Egyptian religion, would naturally write in Greek. On the whole, Valentinus fits this description best. The fact that the author never quotes from the Gospel according to St. John suggests he was not aware of it." Legge's critique (pp. 161 f.) of Harnack's parallels from this Gospel, however, does not seem convincing. The first commentary on the Fourth Gospel was written by a Valentinian.L.'s view of the authorship of the P.S. revives the Valentinian hypothesis in its most radical form. The two books of the Bruce Codex, which Schmidt calls 'The Books of Jeu,' are not the books referred to in the P.S., "which therefore remains the parent document" (p. 194).

In 1918, Moffat (J.) wrote an article titled 'Pistis Sophia' in Hastings' Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics (Edinburgh), volume 10, pages 45-48. This article provides a useful, though brief, summary of the contents and previous opinions. Moffat takes a moderate stance, suggesting that although the P.S. originates from some Gnostic circles in Egypt, its specific type of Gnosticism cannot be identified. He believes that the mention of the name Barbelo links the text to groups like the Ophites, Nicolaitans, Simonians, and Barbelo-Gnostics from the 2nd century.

H. believes that the Yew Books mentioned in the P.S. are unlikely to be the books of C.B. I.

In 1919, Schmidt (C.) published a work titled "Gespräche Jesu mit seinen Jüngern nach der Auferstehung," a Catholic-apostolic epistle from the 2nd century based on a Coptic papyrus from the Institute of Archaeological Mission in Cairo, with contributions from Pierre Lacau, General Director of the Egyptian Museum, and a translation of the Ethiopian text by Dr. Isaak Wajnberg (Leipzig). This document is externally an epistle, similar to the Catholic Epistles of the New Testament, but internally it takes the form of an apocalypse, featuring dialogues between Jesus and his disciples after the Resurrection. This characteristic is unique to Gnostic documents and is exemplified by the P.S., as well as other works like 'The Books of Jeu' from the Bruce Codex, The Gospel of Mary, and The Wisdom of Jesus Christ from the Berlin Codex.The Questions of Mary, both the Great and the Little, from Epiphanius' 'Gnostici,' are also post-resurrectional discourses (p. 206). S. does not re-examine the date of the P.S. in light of this new discovery, but it is clearly important because he concludes about the new document:

[p. lxix]

[paragraph continues] (p. 402): "The Epistola Apostolorum was written by a member of the Catholic Church to criticize Gnostic heresies, especially Docetism. It originated in Asia Minor and dates to the second half of the second century, specifically 160-170 A.D."

60. 1920. Rendel Harris (J.) and Mingana (A.). The Odes and Psalms of Solomon, re-edited for the Governors of the John Rylands Library (Manchester), 2 volumes. Text, 1912; Translation and Notes, 1920. Here, R. H. completely changes his view of P.S. being a translation from Greek. He now believes that (p. 117): "Unless the P.S. has replaced the Sahidic [Bible] version with another version that the author had, avoiding the effort of making a new translation, it is highly likely that the P.S. is an original Coptic text, not a translation from another language (Greek or Syriac) into Coptic." He rejects (p. 183) Worrell's theory (above, 53) of a Gnostic Hymn- and Psalm-book and criticizes (pp. 186 f.) Rahlfs' discovery of two versions of the Psalms (above, 40). He opposes the general view that it was translated from Greek and suggests (p. 186) that further clarification is needed. However, his argument is not very convincing. Regarding the Odes of Solomon, which have generated a significant and enlightening body of literature since the first edition, their fortunate discoverer and skilled editor, upon reviewing the entire issue, believes it is reasonable to conclude that they were written in Antioch in the 1st century (p. 69). Pistis Sophia, by G.R.S.### PISTIS SOPHIA

#### CHAPTER 1

After Jesus rose from the dead, he spent eleven years teaching his disciples. He instructed them about the regions of the First Commandment and the First Mystery, which is beyond a veil. This First Mystery includes the twenty-four mysteries that lie outside and below, existing in the second space of the First Mystery, which is before all other mysteries. The Father appears in the form of a dove within this mystery.

Jesus told his disciples, "I come from the First Mystery, which is also the last mystery and the twenty-fourth mystery." His disciples did not understand that anything existed within that mystery. They believed it was the head of the universe and all existence, the ultimate completion, because Jesus had described it as encompassing the First Commandment, the five Impressions, the great Light, the five Helpers, and the entire Treasury of the Light.

However, Jesus did not fully explain to his disciples all the regions of the great Invisible, the three triple-powers, the twenty-four invisibles, their regions, aeons, and orders. These include the emanations of the great Invisible, their ungenerated, self-generated, and generated beings, light-givers, unpaired beings, rulers, authorities, lords, archangels, angels, decans, servitors, and all the houses of their spheres and orders.Jesus had not explained to his disciples the full scope of the emanations of the Treasury, their order, or how they are organized. He had not told them about their saviors according to each order, nor about the guards at each gate of the Treasury of Light. He hadn't explained the region of the Twin Savior, who is the Child of the Child, or the regions of the three Amens and how they are spread out. He hadn't told them where the five Trees expand or the regions of the seven Amens, also known as the seven Voices.

Jesus had not described the nature of the five Helpers or their regions. He hadn't explained how the great Light expands or its region, nor had he told them about the five Impressions or the First Commandment and their regions. He had spoken to them generally, teaching that these things exist but without providing details on their expansions and regions.

Because of this, the disciples did not know that there were other regions within that mystery. Jesus had not told them, "I have come from such and such regions until I entered that mystery, and then left it." Instead, he said, "I have come from that mystery." This made the disciples think that the mystery was the ultimate completion and the head of the universe, the total fullness.

Jesus had told his disciples, "That mystery surrounds the universe I have spoken to you about since the day I met you until now." This led the disciples to believe there was nothing beyond that mystery.**Chapter 2**

While the disciples were sitting together on the Mount of Olives, discussing these words and feeling immense joy, they were saying to one another, "We are blessed among all people on earth because the Savior has revealed this to us, and we have received the Fullness and complete knowledge." They said this while Jesus sat a little apart from them.

On the fifteenth day of the lunar month of Tybi, when the moon was full, as the sun was rising, a great light-power appeared behind it, shining intensely with immeasurable brightness. This light came from the Light of lights and emerged from the last mystery, the twenty-fourth mystery, from within the orders of the second space of the First Mystery. This light-power descended upon Jesus and completely surrounded him while he sat apart from his disciples. He shone so brightly that they couldn't see him because their eyes were overwhelmed by the great light surrounding him. They only saw the light, which emitted many rays, each different from the others, in a magnificent, immeasurable display of light stretching from beneath the earth to the heavens. When the disciples saw this light, they were filled with great fear and agitation.### CHAPTER 3

When a light-power descended upon Jesus, it gradually enveloped him completely. Jesus then ascended into the sky, shining with an immeasurable light. The disciples watched him silently until he reached heaven, maintaining a deep silence. This event occurred on the fifteenth day of the full moon in the month of Tybi. 

After Jesus reached heaven, three hours later, all the heavenly powers became agitated and moved against each other, causing a disturbance throughout the entire earth and among its inhabitants. Everyone in the world, including the disciples, thought the world might end. The agitation continued from the third hour of the fifteenth day of the moon of Tybi until the ninth hour of the next day. During this time, all the angels, archangels, and heavenly powers sang praises so loudly that the whole world heard them, without stopping until the ninth hour of the next day.

### CHAPTER 4

The disciples sat together in fear, deeply shaken by the great earthquake that had occurred. They cried together, wondering if the Savior might destroy all regions. As they wept and worried, at the ninth hour of the next day, the heavens opened, and they saw Jesus descending, shining with an immeasurable light.He shone more brightly than when he first ascended to the heavens, so much so that people on Earth could not describe the light surrounding him. The light radiated abundantly, with no limit to its rays, and the light was varied, with some rays being more brilliant than others. The entire light was unified, but it had three distinct kinds. Each kind of light was more excellent than the one below it: the second kind, in the middle, was more excellent than the first kind below, and the third kind, above them all, was the most excellent. The first light, at the bottom, was similar to the light that had surrounded Jesus before he ascended to the heavens, unique in its brilliance. These three types of light were distinct, each more excellent than the other.

CHAPTER 5

When the disciples saw this, they were extremely afraid and agitated. Jesus, compassionate and tender-hearted, saw their agitation and spoke to them, saying, "Take courage. It is I, do not be afraid."

CHAPTER 6

When the disciples heard this, they said, "Lord, if it is you, please withdraw your light-glory into yourself so we can stand. Otherwise, our eyes are blinded, and we are agitated, along with the whole world, because of the great light around you."Then Jesus revealed his radiant light. The disciples, encouraged, approached Jesus, bowed down, worshipped him joyfully, and asked, "Rabbi, where did you go? What was your mission? Why were there so many disturbances and earthquakes?"

Jesus, full of compassion, said to them, "Rejoice from now on, for I have returned to the place I came from. From today, I will speak to you openly about the Truth, from the beginning to the end. I will no longer hide anything from you about the mysteries of the highest and the region of Truth. I have been given authority by the Ineffable and the First Mystery of all mysteries to speak to you from the beginning to the fullness, both outwardly and inwardly. Listen, and I will tell you everything.

When I sat a little way from you on the Mount of Olives, I thought about the mission I was sent for, and realized it was complete, except for the last mystery, the twenty-fourth mystery of the First Mystery's second space, which had not yet sent me my garment. Knowing my mission was complete but still waiting for my garment, I sat on the Mount of Olives, a little away from you."

Pistis Sophia, by G.R.S.When the sun rose in the east, through the First Mystery that has existed since the beginning and from which the universe was created, I came forth—not before my crucifixion, but now. By the command of that mystery, my Light-vesture, which was given to me from the beginning and left behind in the last mystery (the twenty-fourth mystery from within without, in the orders of the second space of the First Mystery), was sent to me. I had left that Vesture in the last mystery until it was time to put it on and begin teaching humanity, revealing the complete Truth from beginning to end, from the innermost to the outermost and vice versa. Rejoice and be glad, for I am speaking to you first about the entire Truth.

This is why I chose you from the beginning through the First Mystery. Be joyful, for when I came into the world, I brought with me twelve powers from the twelve saviors of the Treasury of the Light, as commanded by the First Mystery. I placed these powers into the wombs of your mothers, and they are now within your bodies.These powers have been given to you before the entire world because you are the ones who will save it. You need these powers to endure the threats, pains, dangers, and persecutions from the rulers of this world. I have often told you that I brought my power to you from the twelve saviors in the Treasury of Light. This is why I said from the beginning that you are not of this world, and neither am I. Everyone else in the world has souls influenced by the rulers of the aeons, but the power within you comes from me; your souls belong to the higher realm. 

I brought twelve powers from the twelve saviors of the Treasury of Light, deriving them from my own power. When I came into the world, I assumed the form of Gabriel, the angel of the aeons, so the rulers of the aeons did not recognize me and thought I was Gabriel.

When I entered the midst of the aeons' rulers, I looked down on humanity by the command of the First Mystery. I found Elizabeth, John the Baptist's mother, before she conceived him, and I implanted a power in her from the Good, who is in the Midst. This was so John could prepare the way for me and baptize with the water of forgiveness. That power now resides in John's body.### Modern English Simplification:

Furthermore, instead of the soul of the ruler that was supposed to be received, I discovered the soul of the prophet Elijah in the realms of the sphere. I took his soul and brought it to the Virgin of Light. She handed it over to her receivers, who then took it to the sphere of the rulers and placed it into the womb of Elizabeth. So, the power of the little Iao, who is in the Midst, and the soul of the prophet Elijah were combined into the body of John the Baptist.

This is why you were confused earlier when I said to you: 'John said: I am not the Christ,' and you replied: 'The scripture says that when the Christ comes, Elijah will come before him to prepare the way.' But when you told me this, I said: 'Elijah has indeed come and prepared everything, as it is written, and they have done to him as they pleased.' And when I realized that you did not understand that I was talking about the soul of Elijah being in John the Baptist, I spoke to you openly and clearly: 'If you are willing to accept it, John the Baptist is Elijah, of whom I said he would come.'"

#### Chapter 8

Jesus continued: "Later, following the command of the First Mystery, I looked down upon the world of humans and found Mary, who is called 'my mother' in the physical sense. I spoke to her in the form of Gabriel, and when she turned towards me, I cast into her the first power that I had received from Barbelo—the body that I had borne in the heights. Instead of a soul, I cast into her the power that I had received from the great Sabaoth, the Good, who is in the region of the Right."The twelve powers of the twelve saviors from the Treasury of Light, which I received from the twelve ministers of the Midst, I cast into the sphere of the rulers. The decans of the rulers and their servants thought these powers were souls of the rulers. The servants took these powers and bound them into the bodies of your mothers. When your time was complete, you were born into the world without the souls of the rulers within you. You received a portion of the power that the last Helper breathed into the Mixture, a power blended with all the invisibles, rulers, and aeons—in short, with the world of destruction that is the Mixture. This power, which I originally brought out of myself, I cast into the First Commandment. The First Commandment cast a portion of this power into the great Light, which then passed a portion to the five Helpers. The last Helper took a portion and cast it into the Mixture, which is now in everyone within the Mixture, as I have just explained to you.

Jesus said this to his disciples on the Mount of Olives. He continued speaking to his disciples, saying, "Rejoice and be glad, for the time has come for me to put on my garment, prepared for me from the beginning, which I left behind in the last mystery until the time of its completion. Now is that time. I shall be commanded by the First Mystery to teach you from the beginning of the Truth to its completion, from the deepest to the most superficial parts, for you will save the world. Rejoice and be glad, for you are blessed above all people on earth. You will save the whole world."### Chapter 9

After Jesus had finished speaking to his disciples, he continued and said, "Look, I have put on my Vesture, and all authority has been given to me through the First Mystery. Soon, I will reveal the mystery of the universe and its entirety to you. From now on, I will hide nothing from you. I will make you perfect in all aspects and reveal all mysteries to you, which are the highest forms of perfection and knowledge. I will explain everything from the outermost to the innermost secrets. Listen as I tell you everything that has happened to me."

### Chapter 10

"When the sun rose in the east, a great light-power descended, carrying my Vesture, which I had left behind in the twenty-fourth mystery. In my Vesture, I found a mystery written in five words from the heights: zama zama ozza rachama ozai. This translates to:

"'O Mystery, which exists beyond the world and for whose sake the universe was created, this is the total outflow and ascent that has generated all emanations and everything within it. For your sake, all mysteries and their regions have arisen. Come to us, for we are your fellow members. We are all united with you; we are one and the same. You are the First Mystery, existing from the beginning in the Ineffable before it manifested. We are all part of your name. Now, we have come to meet you at the final boundary, which is also the last mystery from within; it is a part of us.'"We have now sent you your garment, which has belonged to you from the beginning but was left behind at the final boundary. This garment is the last mystery from within, now ready to be worn according to the command of the First Mystery. Its time has come; put it on.

"Come to us, and we will dress you in the First Mystery and all its glory, as commanded by the First Mystery. The First Mystery has given us two garments for you, in addition to the one we have sent, because you are worthy of them, having existed before us. This is why the First Mystery has sent you the mystery of all its glory through us, consisting of two garments.

"The first garment contains the entire glory of all the names of all mysteries and emanations of the orders of the Ineffable spaces.

"The second garment holds the glory of the name of all mysteries and emanations within the orders of the two spaces of the First Mystery.

"In the third garment, which we have just sent you, is the glory of the name of the mystery of the Revealer, which is the First Commandment. It also contains the mystery of the five Impressions, the great Envoy of the Ineffable (the great Light), and the five Leaders (the five Helpers). Additionally, this garment holds the glory of the name of the mystery of all orders of the emanations of the Treasury of the Light and their saviors, the orders of the seven Amens, the seven Voices, the five Trees, the three Amens, the Twin-savior (the Child of the Child), and the nine guards of the three gates of the Treasury of the Light.Here is the text converted into modern English:

---

There is also the complete glory of the name of all those who are in the Right, and of all those who are in the Midst. Additionally, there is the complete glory of the name of the great Invisible, which is the great Forefather, and the mystery of the three triple-powers, their entire region, and all the invisibles. This includes all those in the thirteenth aeon, the names of the twelve aeons, their rulers, archangels, angels, and all who are in the twelve aeons. It also includes the complete mystery of the names of everyone in Fate and all the heavens, everyone in the sphere, and its firmaments, and all their regions.

"Look, we have sent you this garment, which no one has known from the First Commandment onwards, because its light was hidden in it, and neither the spheres nor any regions from the First Commandment onwards have known it. Hurry and put on this garment and come to us. We are drawing near to you to clothe you by the command of the First Mystery with your two other garments, which existed for you from the beginning with the First Mystery until the appointed time by the Ineffable is completed.

Come to us quickly so we can dress you in them, until you have completed the total ministry of the perfection of the First Mystery as appointed by the Ineffable. Come to us quickly, so we can clothe you with them, according to the command of the First Mystery. Soon, very soon, you will come to us and leave the world. Come quickly so you can receive your full glory, which is the glory of the First Mystery."

This version maintains the original meaning while using simpler and more modern language.Sure, here's the text converted into modern English:

---

CHAPTER 11

"When I saw the mystery of all these words in the garment that was sent to me, I immediately put it on. I shone very brightly and soared up into the sky. I came to the first gate of the firmament, shining so brightly that there was no limit to the light around me. The gates of the firmament shook and all opened at once.

All the rulers, authorities, and angels inside were thrown into confusion because of the great light surrounding me. They looked at the radiant garment I was wearing and saw the mystery that contained their names. They were very afraid. All the bonds that held them were loosened, and each one left their position. They all fell down before me, worshipped, and said, 'How did the lord of the universe pass through us without our knowing?' They all sang praises to the innermost parts, but they didn't see me, only the light. They were very scared and agitated, and sang praises to the innermost parts.

CHAPTER 12

"I left that region and ascended to the first sphere, shining forty-nine times brighter than in the firmament. When I reached the gate of the first sphere, its gates shook and opened by themselves at once.

I entered the houses of the sphere, shining very brightly, with no limit to the light around me. All the rulers and inhabitants of that sphere were thrown into confusion. They saw the great light around me, looked at my garment, and saw the mystery of their names on it."

---

I hope this helps!They became even more agitated and fearful, saying, "How did the lord of the universe pass through us without us knowing?" All their bonds were broken, their regions and orders fell into disarray. Everyone left their positions, fell down together, and worshipped before me, or my garment, singing praises together in great fear and agitation.

---

CHAPTER 13

"I left that region and came to the gate of the second sphere, known as Fate. All its gates became agitated and opened by themselves. I entered the houses of Fate, shining extremely brightly, with immeasurable light surrounding me; I shone in Fate forty-nine times more than in the first sphere. All the rulers and inhabitants of Fate were thrown into agitation, fell on one another, and were very afraid when they saw the great light around me. They looked at my garment of light and saw the mystery of their names on it, which made them even more agitated and fearful. They said, 'How did the lord of the universe pass through us without us knowing?' All the bonds of their regions, orders, and houses were broken; they all came at once, fell down, worshipped before me, and sang praises together in great fear and agitation.

---

CHAPTER 14

"I left that region and ascended to the great aeons of the rulers, arriving before their veils and gates, shining extremely brightly with immeasurable light surrounding me. When I arrived at the twelve aeons, their veils and gates were shaken against each other."Their veils parted on their own, and their gates opened across from each other. I entered the aeons, shining extremely brightly, with immeasurable light around me, forty-nine times brighter than the light I had in the houses of Fate.

All the angels of the aeons, their archangels, rulers, gods, lords, authorities, tyrants, powers, light-sparks, light-givers, unpaired beings, invisibles, forefathers, and triple-powers saw me, shining exceedingly brightly, with an immeasurable light around me. They were thrown into great agitation and fear when they saw the immense light around me. In their fear and agitation, they retreated to the region of the great invisible Forefather and the three great triple-powers. The great Forefather and the triple-powers were so terrified that they kept running back and forth in their region, unable to close all their regions because of their fear. They disturbed all their aeons, spheres, and orders, greatly frightened and agitated by the great light around me.

The light around me was not the same as when I was on the earth among mankind, where the light-vesture came over me. The world could not bear the light in its true form, or it would be destroyed along with everything on it. The light around me in the twelve aeons was 87,000 times greater than the light that surrounded me in the world among you.### Chapter 15

When those in the twelve aeons saw the great light surrounding me, they were thrown into chaos, running back and forth in confusion. The aeons and heavens were all disturbed because they didn't understand the mystery that had occurred. Adamas, the great Tyrant, and all the other tyrants in the aeons tried in vain to fight against the light. They didn't know who they were fighting because they could only see the overwhelming light.

As they fought against the light, they grew weaker and fell in the aeons, becoming like the dead inhabitants of the earth, without breath or life. I took away a third of their power to prevent them from continuing their evil deeds. This was so that if people in the world called upon them in their rituals or sorceries, they wouldn't be able to succeed.

I also changed the fate and sphere over which they rule. Now, they spend six months facing the left, carrying out their influences, and six months facing the right, also carrying out their influences. This was done by the command of the First Commandment and the First Mystery, Yew, the Overseer of the Light, who originally set them to always face the left and perform their deeds.

### Chapter 16

When I entered their region, they rebelled and fought against the light.### Chapter 17

After he said this to his disciples, he told them, "Anyone with ears to hear should listen." When Mary heard the Savior's words, she stared into the air for about an hour. Then she said, "My Lord, allow me to speak openly." Jesus, full of compassion, replied, "Mary, you are blessed and I will perfect you in all the mysteries of the heights. Speak openly, you whose heart is raised to the kingdom of heaven more than all your brothers."

### Chapter 18

Mary then said to the Savior, "My Lord, the words you have spoken to us, 'Anyone with ears to hear should listen,' are meant for us to understand what you have said. Therefore, my Lord, let me speak openly."The message you delivered: "I have taken a third of the power from the rulers of all the aeons and altered their fate and the sphere they govern, so that if humans invoke them in the mysteries—those taught by the fallen angels for their wicked and unlawful deeds in the mystery of their sorcery—they will no longer be able to perform these lawless actions. This is because you have taken their power from them, as well as from their astrologers, consultants, and those who predict future events. Now, they won't be able to predict anything accurately because you have changed their spheres. For six months, they turn to the left to exert their influence, and for another six months, they turn to the right to exert their influence.

Regarding this, my Lord, the power within the prophet Isaiah spoke and foretold in a spiritual metaphor about the 'Vision concerning Egypt': 'Where then, O Egypt, are your consultants, astrologers, and those who cry out from the earth and from their belly? Let them now tell you the deeds that the Lord Sabaoth will do!'

The power within the prophet Isaiah prophesied before you came that you would take away the power of the rulers of the aeons and change their sphere and fate, so they would no longer know anything. This is why it also says: 'You will not know what the Lord Sabaoth will do'; meaning none of the rulers will know what you will do from now on—they are 'Egypt,' symbolizing matter."### Chapter 19

Mary finished speaking and Jesus said, "Well said, Mary. You are blessed above all women on Earth because you will embody the fullness of all things and the perfection of all perfections." Upon hearing this, Mary was overjoyed. She approached Jesus, fell at his feet, and said, "My Lord, listen to me so I may ask you a question before you tell us about the places you visited." Jesus replied, "Speak openly and do not fear; I will reveal everything you ask."

### Chapter 20

Mary asked, "My Lord, will the men who know the secrets of the magic of the rulers of all the aeons and the sphere, as taught by the fallen angels, be able to use this evil magic to prevent good deeds in the future?" Jesus answered, "They will not be able to use it as effectively as before because I have taken away a third of their power. However, they will still seek help from those who know the secrets of the magic of the thirteenth aeon."And if they call upon the mystical powers of those in the thirteenth aeon, they will achieve their goals effectively and surely, because I have not removed power from that region, as ordered by the First Mystery.

CHAPTER 21

After Jesus finished speaking, Mary asked, "My Lord, won't astrologers and fortune-tellers still be able to predict the future for people?" Jesus replied, "If astrologers find the Fate and the sphere turned to the left, as it was originally, their predictions will come true, and they will accurately say what will happen. But if they find the Fate or the sphere turned to the right, their predictions will be false, because I have altered their influences and geometric configurations. Originally, these influences were always turned to the left. Now, I have made them alternate, spending six months turned to the left and six months turned to the right. 

Anyone who calculates based on my changes, observing the six-month shifts, will understand their influences accurately and predict events correctly. Similarly, fortune-tellers who call upon the names of the rulers and find them facing left will provide accurate answers to those seeking guidance about their future."On the contrary, if people call upon their names while facing right, they won't respond, because their names change depending on whether they are facing left or right. If they call upon them while facing right, they won't tell the truth but will confuse and threaten them. Those who don't know the correct way, their triangles, squares, and other shapes, will find nothing true and will be greatly confused and deceived, because I have changed their previous works done while facing left. I made them spend six months forming all their shapes while facing right, to confuse them completely.

Additionally, I made them spend six months facing left, doing their work and forming their shapes, so that the rulers in the aeons, spheres, heavens, and all regions would be confused and deluded, unable to understand their own paths.**Chapter 22**

When Jesus finished speaking, Philip was writing down everything Jesus said. Afterward, Philip came forward, knelt, and worshipped at Jesus' feet, saying, "My Lord and Savior, please give me permission to speak and ask you questions about these words before you tell us about the places you went for your ministry." The compassionate Savior replied, "You have permission to speak and ask your questions." Philip then asked Jesus, "My Lord, why did you change the paths and destinies of the rulers, their aeons, and their regions, causing them confusion and leading them astray? Did you do this for the salvation of the world or for another reason?"

**Chapter 23**

Jesus replied to Philip and all the disciples, "I changed their paths for the salvation of all souls. Truly, I tell you, if I had not changed their paths, many souls would have been lost, and they would have suffered for a long time. The rulers of the aeons, Fate, and the sphere, and all their regions and heavens, had to be nullified. Otherwise, souls would have remained outside for a long time, delaying the completion of the number of perfect souls who are meant to be counted in the Inheritance of the Height through the mysteries and be in the Treasury of the Light."### Chapter 24

After Jesus finished speaking to his disciples, Mary, known for her eloquence and blessed nature, approached him. She fell at Jesus' feet and said, "My Lord, please allow me to speak, and don't be angry if I often trouble you with my questions." The compassionate Savior replied, "Speak what you wish, and I will reveal everything to you openly." Mary then asked Jesus, "My Lord, how will the souls delay themselves here, and how will they be quickly purified?"

### Chapter 25

Jesus responded to Mary, "Well said, Mary. Your question is excellent and sheds light on everything with clarity. From now on, I will hide nothing from you and will reveal everything with certainty and openness. Listen, Mary, and all disciples: Before I made the proclamation to all the rulers of the aeons, Fate, and the sphere, they were all bound in their respective bonds, spheres, and seals, as Yew, the Overseer of the Light, had bound them from the beginning. Each of them stayed in their order and followed their course as Yew had established."When the time came for Melchisedec, the great Receiver of the Light, he would enter the midst of the aeons and all the rulers bound in the sphere and in Fate. He would take the purified light from all these rulers, which caused them agitation. He then set in motion the hastener over them, making their cycles move quickly. The hastener took their power, the breath from their mouths, the tears from their eyes, and the sweat from their bodies.

Melchisedec, the Receiver of the Light, purified these powers and took their light to the Treasury of the Light. The servants of all the rulers gathered all the matter from them. The servants of the rulers of Fate and the sphere below the aeons used this matter to create the souls of humans, animals, reptiles, wild beasts, and birds, sending them into the world of mankind. 

Additionally, the receivers of the sun and moon, when looking above and seeing the paths of the aeons, Fate, and the sphere, would take the light-power from them. The sun receivers would prepare it and hand it over to the receivers of Melchisedec, the Light-purifier. They would take the material residue to the sphere below the aeons, fashioning it into souls of humans, reptiles, cattle, wild beasts, and birds according to the rulers' cycles and the sphere's configurations. They would then send these souls into the world of mankind, where they became souls in this region, as I have explained to you.**CHAPTER 26**

They continued their work until their power diminished, and they became weak and exhausted. When they lost their power, their light faded, their kingdom was destroyed, and the universe rose quickly. When they realized this, and when the number of Melchisedec, the Receiver of the Light, was reached, he came out and entered among the rulers of all the aeons, the Fate, and the sphere. He caused them great agitation, making them quickly abandon their positions.

Immediately, they were forced to release their power through their breath, tears, and sweat. Melchisedec, the Receiver of the Light, purified them as he always does, carrying their light to the Treasury of the Light. The rulers of the aeons, the Fate, and the sphere turned to their refuse matter. They consumed it, preventing it from becoming souls in the world. They did this to avoid becoming weak and exhausted, to prevent their power from ceasing and their kingdom from being destroyed, and to delay the process until the number of perfect souls in the Treasury of the Light was complete.

Pistis Sophia, by G.R.S.**Chapter 27**

When the rulers of the aeons, Fate, and the sphere continued their activities—recycling their matter and preventing souls from being born into the world to prolong their rule and keep souls outside—they did this continually for two cycles.

When I wanted to ascend for the mission I was called to by the First Mystery, I entered the midst of the rulers of the twelve aeons, wearing my shining light-vesture. The light around me was immeasurable. When the tyrants saw the great light, Adamas, the Tyrant, and all the rulers of the twelve aeons began to fight against the light of my vesture, wanting to hold it and delay their loss of power. They did this without knowing whom they were fighting.

When they rebelled and fought against the light, I, by command of the First Mystery, changed the paths and courses of their aeons, Fate, and sphere. I made them face six months towards the triangles on the left, the squares, and their aspects and octagons, as they had before. But I changed their direction to face another order for six months towards the influences in the squares on the right, their triangles, aspects, and octagons.I caused the rulers of the aeons, the Fate, and the sphere to be deeply confused and deluded. I agitated them greatly, so they could no longer consume the leftover matter to sustain their regions and extend their rule.

When I took away a third of their power, I altered their spheres, making them alternate between facing left and right. I changed their entire path to speed up their purification and elevation. I shortened their cycles and made their paths faster, causing them to be confused and unable to consume the leftover purified light. I also shortened their time periods, so the perfect number of souls who receive the mysteries and enter the Treasury of Light would be completed quickly.

Had I not altered their courses and shortened their periods, they would have prevented any soul from entering the world by consuming the leftover matter, destroying many souls. This is why I said before, "I have shortened the times for the sake of my elect; otherwise, no soul could be saved." I shortened the times and periods for the perfect number of souls, the "elect," so they could be saved. Without this, no material soul would have been saved; they would have perished in the fire within the rulers' flesh. This is the precise answer to your question.After Jesus finished speaking to his disciples, they all fell down together, worshiped him, and said, "We are blessed above all men because you have revealed these great deeds to us."

---

Then Jesus continued speaking to his disciples, saying, "Listen to what happened to me among the rulers of the twelve aeons, their lords, authorities, angels, and archangels. When they saw the garment of light around me, each of them saw the mystery of their name on my garment of light. They all fell down together, worshiped the garment of light around me, and cried out, 'How did the lord of the universe pass through us without us knowing?' They all sang praises to the deepest core. All their powerful beings, ancestors, gods, light-sparks, and light-bearers—essentially all their great ones—saw that their power was weakened. They became extremely fearful. They looked at the mystery of their name on my garment and wanted to come and worship it but couldn't because of the great light around me. So, they worshiped from a little distance away, praising the light of my garment and singing praises to the deepest core."It happened that when this occurred among the tyrants below the rulers, they all lost their power, fell to the ground in their realms, and became like the dead, with no breath in them, just as they were when I took their power from them. 

Afterward, when I left those realms, everyone in the twelve realms was bound to their order. They continued their work as I had established, spending six months turned to the left, working in their squares and triangles, and another six months turned to the right, also working in their squares and triangles. This is how those in Fate and the sphere will travel.

CHAPTER 29

After that, I ascended to the veils of the thirteenth realm. When I arrived, the veils parted and opened for me. I entered the thirteenth realm and found Pistis Sophia below it, all alone. She was grieving and mourning because she had not been allowed into the higher thirteenth realm. She was also suffering from the torments inflicted by Self-willed, one of the three triple-powers. I will explain this mystery to you later.

When Pistis Sophia saw me shining with an immeasurable light, she was greatly agitated and stared at the light of my robe.She saw the mystery of her name on my clothing and the full glory of its meaning. Previously, she was in the thirteenth aeon, in the higher region, where she used to sing praises to the higher light she saw in the veil of the Treasury of the Light. When she continued praising the higher light, all the rulers with the two great triple-powers, along with her invisible partner and the other twenty-two invisible emanations, looked at the light. Pistis Sophia and her partner, together with the other twenty-two emanations, make up the twenty-four emanations created by the great invisible Forefather and the two great triple-powers.

CHAPTER 30

After Jesus had said this to his disciples, Mary stepped forward and asked, "My Lord, I have heard you say before that Pistis Sophia is one of the twenty-four emanations. Why isn't she in their region? You said you found her below the thirteenth aeon."

Jesus replied to his disciples, "When Pistis Sophia was in the thirteenth aeon, among all her invisible brethren, the twenty-four emanations of the great Invisible, she looked up by the command of the First Mystery and saw the light of the veil of the Treasury of the Light. She longed to reach that region but could not. She stopped performing the mystery of the thirteenth aeon and sang praises to the light of the height, which she saw in the veil of the Treasury of the Light."When she praised the higher realm, all the rulers in the twelve aeons below started to hate her. They were angry because she had stopped participating in their rituals and wanted to ascend above them. The powerful Self-willed being in the thirteenth aeon also hated her. He had not completed his purification and wanted to rule over the thirteenth aeon and those below it. 

The rulers of the twelve aeons were enraged with Pistis Sophia, who was above them, because she aimed to reach a higher light. The Self-willed being joined the rulers in their anger and hatred towards her. He created a powerful lion-faced entity and other violent beings from his essence, sending them to the chaotic regions below to trap Pistis Sophia and strip her of her power. She had ceased their rituals, continuously sought the light she had seen, and lamented.

The rulers and the guards at the aeon gates also hated her for abandoning their mysteries. Following the First Commandment, the powerful Self-willed being, one of the three primary forces, took action against her.### Chapter 31

Sophia looked down and saw a light-power below. She didn't realize it belonged to the Self-willed being with triple powers; instead, she thought it was part of the original light she had seen above, coming from the Treasury of Light. She decided to go down and take this light to create her own light-aeons, hoping to reach the ultimate Light above.

With this thought, she left her region in the thirteenth aeon and went down to the twelve aeons. The rulers of these aeons chased her angrily because she aspired to greatness. She continued further into the chaotic regions and approached the lion-faced light-power to absorb it. However, the material emanations of Self-willed surrounded her, and the lion-faced light-power consumed all her light.

Her light was taken, and her matter was thrown into chaos. She became a lion-faced ruler in this chaos, half fire and half darkness, known as Yaldabaoth, whom I have mentioned to you before. Exhausted, Sophia was left with no light-powers, and the material powers of Self-willed pressed against her harshly.Pistis Sophia cried out desperately to the Light of lights, which she had believed in from the beginning, and expressed her repentance in these words:

1. "O Light of lights, in whom I have had faith from the beginning, listen to my repentance. Save me, O Light, for evil thoughts have entered my mind.

2. I looked, O Light, into the lower regions and saw a light. I thought: 'I will go to that place to take that light.' But when I went, I found myself in the darkness of the chaos below. I could not escape and return to my place, because I was overwhelmed by the forces of Self-willed, and the lion-faced power took away my inner light.

3. I cried for help, but my voice did not reach out of the darkness. I looked up to the height, hoping that the Light, in which I had faith, would help me.

4. When I looked up, I saw all the rulers of the aeons looking down on me and rejoicing over my plight, even though I had done them no wrong. They hated me without reason. When the forces of Self-willed saw the rulers of the aeons rejoicing, they realized that the rulers would not help me. Encouraged, these forces took the light from me that I had not taken from them.

5. Now, O Light of Truth, you know that I acted in innocence, thinking the lion-faced light-power belonged to you. The sin I have committed is clear before you.

6. Do not let me suffer any longer, O Lord, for I have had faith in your light from the beginning. O Lord, O Light of the powers, do not let me lack my light.

7. Because of your influence and for the sake of your light, I have fallen into this suffering, and shame has covered me.

8. And because of...The illusion of your light has made me a stranger to my brothers, the invisible beings, and the great emanations of Barbelo. 

This happened to me, O Light, because I have been devoted to your dwelling; and the wrath of Self-willed has come upon me—he who did not listen to your command to emanate from the emanation of his power—because I was in his realm without performing his mystery.

All the rulers of the realms mocked me.

I was in that place, mourning and seeking the light I had seen above. The guards of the gates of the realms searched for me, and everyone involved in their mystery mocked me. But I looked up to you and had faith in you. Now, O Light of lights, I am deeply troubled in the darkness of chaos. If you will come to save me—great is your mercy—then hear me truly and save me.

Save me from the matter of this darkness, so that I may not be submerged in it, and from the emanations of the god Self-willed which press upon me, and from their evil actions. Let not this darkness submerge me, and let not this lion-faced power completely devour all my power, and let not this chaos shroud my power.

Hear me, O Light, for your grace is precious, and look down upon me with your great mercy. Do not turn your face from me, for I am greatly tormented. Hurry, listen to me, and save my power. Save me because of the rulers who hate me, for you know my great suffering and my torment and the torment of my power which they have taken from me. Those who have caused me all this evil are before you; deal with them as you see fit.My power emerged from the chaos and darkness, and I waited for my partner to come and fight for me. But he did not come, and I hoped he would lend me strength, but he was nowhere to be found.

When I sought the light, they gave me darkness; when I sought my power, they gave me matter. 

Therefore, O Light of lights, let the darkness and matter that Self-willed's emanations have brought upon me become a trap for them. Let them be ensnared and stumble, unable to reach their self-willed region.

May they remain in darkness and never see the light; let them look upon chaos forever and never aspire to the heights. 

Bring vengeance upon them, and may your judgment take hold of them. Let them no longer enter their region to their god Self-willed, and let his emanations no longer come into their regions. Their god is wicked and self-willed, believing he did this evil on his own, not knowing that if I hadn't been brought low by your command, he would have had no power over me.

But when you commanded that I be brought low, they pursued me even more, and their emanations added to my suffering. They have taken light-power from me and continue to oppress me to drain all the light from me. Because of this, do not let them ascend to the thirteenth aeon, the region of Righteousness.

Do not count them among those who purify themselves and the light, nor among those who quickly repent and receive mysteries in the Light. For they have taken my light from me, and my power has started to fade, leaving me destitute of my light.Now, therefore, O Light that is within you and with me, I sing praises to your name, O Light, in glory.

31. May my song of praise please you, O Light, as an excellent mystery that leads to the gates of the Light. Those who repent will say it, and its light will purify them.

32. Now, let all things rejoice; seek the Light so that the power of the stars within you may live.

33. For the Light has heard everything and will purify all.

34. Let souls and all things praise the Lord of all ages, and let everything within them praise Him.

35. For God shall save their souls from all things, and a city will be prepared in the Light. All saved souls will live in that city and inherit it.

36. The souls that receive mysteries will dwell in that region, and those who received mysteries in its name will stay there.

CHAPTER 33

When Jesus had spoken these words to his disciples, he said: "This is the song of praise that Pistis Sophia uttered in her first repentance, repenting of her sin and recounting all that happened to her. Now, let anyone who has ears to hear, listen."

Mary came forward and said: "My Lord, my inner light has ears, and I hear with my light-power. Your spirit with me has sobered me. Listen then, so I may speak about the repentance that Pistis Sophia uttered, speaking of her sin and all that happened to her. Your light-power prophesied this before through the prophet David in Psalm 68:

1. Save me, O God, for the waters have come up to my soul.

2. I sank in the slime of the abyss, and I had no power. I have gone down into the depths of the sea; a tempest has submerged me."I have kept crying; my voice is gone, my eyes are tired, waiting for God. 

4. Those who hate me without reason are more than the hairs on my head; powerful are my enemies who pursue me violently. They demand things I did not take from them.

5. God, you know my foolishness, and my faults are not hidden from you.

6. Don't let those who wait on you, O Lord, be ashamed because of me; don't let those who seek you be disgraced because of me, O God of Israel.

7. For your sake, I have endured shame; disgrace has covered my face.

8. I have become a stranger to my siblings, an outsider to my own family.

9. My passion for your house consumes me; the insults of those who insult you fall on me.

10. I humbled myself with fasting, and it became a source of scorn.

11. I wore sackcloth, and I became a joke to them.

12. Those who sit at the gates gossip about me; and those who drink wine make songs about me.

13. But I pray to you, O Lord, in your good time; in the abundance of your love, answer me with your salvation.

14. Save me from sinking in the mud; rescue me from those who hate me, and from the deep waters.

15. Don't let the floodwaters engulf me; don't let the deep swallow me up, don't let the pit close its mouth over me.

16. Answer me, O Lord, for your love is good; in your great mercy, turn to me.

17. Do not hide your face from your servant; I am in trouble. Answer me quickly.

18. Come near and rescue me; deliver me because of my enemies.

19. You know how I am scorned, disgraced, and shamed; all my enemies are before you.

20. My heart is broken by scorn and misery; I looked for sympathy, but there was none, for comforters, but I found none.They gave me bitter food and vinegar to drink when I was thirsty. 

22. Let their feast become a trap, a punishment, and a stumbling block.

23. May you bend their backs forever.

24. Pour out your anger on them, and let your wrath overtake them.

25. Let their camp be deserted, with no one living in their homes.

26. For they persecuted the one you struck and added to his pain.

27. They increased their sins; do not let them be part of your righteousness.

28. Erase their names from the book of life and do not include them among the righteous.

29. I am poor and heartbroken, but your salvation has taken hold of me.

30. I will praise God's name in song and thank Him.

31. This will please God more than an ox with horns and hooves.

32. Let the poor see and be glad; seek God so your souls may live.

33. For God hears the needy and does not despise the prisoners.

34. Let heaven and earth, the sea and everything in it, praise the Lord.

35. For God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah. People will live there and inherit it.

36. The descendants of His servants will possess it, and those who love His name will live there.

CHAPTER 34

After Mary finished speaking these words to Jesus among the disciples, she said to him: "My Lord, this is the meaning of the repentance of Pistis Sophia." When Jesus heard Mary speak, he said to her: "Well said, Mary, blessed one, who will be called blessed in all generations."Jesus continued speaking and said, "Pistis Sophia continued and sang praises in a second repentance, saying:

"'1. Light of lights, in whom I have faith, do not leave me in darkness until the end of my days.
"'2. Help me and save me through your mysteries; listen to me and save me.
"'3. May the power of your light save me and carry me to the higher realms; for you will save me and lead me to the heights of your realms.
"'4. Save me, O Light, from the hand of this lion-faced power and from the hands of the emanations of Self-willed.
"'5. For it is you, O Light, in whom I have had faith and trusted from the beginning.
"'6. I have had faith in you since you brought me into existence; you made me emanate, and I have had faith in your light from the start.

"'7. When I had faith in you, the rulers of the realms mocked me, saying: She has lost her mystery. You are my savior, my deliverer, and my mystery, O Light.
"'8. My mouth was filled with praise, so I may always speak of the mystery of your greatness.
"'9. Now, therefore, O Light, do not leave me in chaos for the rest of my time; do not abandon me, O Light.
"'10. All the emanations of Self-willed have taken my entire light-power and have surrounded me. They wanted to take all my light away and have watched over my power,

"'11. Saying to one another: The Light has forsaken her, let us seize her and take all the light within her.
"'12. Therefore, O Light, do not leave me; turn to me, O Light, and save me from the hands of the merciless.
"'13. May those who want to take away my power fall and become powerless. May those who want to take my light-power be wrapped in darkness and lose their strength.'"Here is the text converted into modern English:

---

This is the second repentance that Pistis Sophia has expressed, praising the Light.

**CHAPTER 36**

After Jesus finished speaking to his disciples, he asked them, "Do you understand what I am saying to you?" Peter stepped forward and said to Jesus:

"Lord, we cannot tolerate this woman because she takes every opportunity to speak and doesn't let any of us speak, but she talks many times." 

Jesus replied to his disciples, "Anyone whose spirit is stirred and understands what I am saying should come forward and speak. But now, Peter, I see that you understand the meaning of the repentance that Pistis Sophia has expressed. Therefore, Peter, explain her repentance to your fellow disciples."

Peter answered and said to Jesus, "Lord, listen as I explain her repentance, which your power previously prophesied through the prophet David in the seventieth Psalm:

1. O God, my God, I have trusted in you; let me never be put to shame. 
2. Save me in your righteousness and set me free; listen to me and save me. 
3. Be my strong protector and secure place to save me; for you are my strength and refuge. 
4. My God, save me from the hand of the sinner, the transgressor, and the wicked. 
5. For you are my endurance, O Lord; you have been my hope since my youth. 
6. I have relied on you since my mother's womb; you brought me out of my mother's womb. My trust is always in you. 
7. I have become like a madman to many; you are my help and my strength, you are my deliverer, O Lord.
8.

---

This simplified version maintains the original meaning while using contemporary language.My mouth was filled with praise, so I could glorify your splendor all day long. 

"Do not cast me away in old age; do not abandon me if my strength fades. 

"For my enemies have spoken against me, and those who seek my life have plotted against me, 

"saying: God has forsaken him; pursue and seize him, for there is no one to save him. 

"God, help me. 

"Let those who slander me be ashamed and destroyed. Let those who seek to harm me be covered in shame and disgrace." 

This is the meaning of the second repentance that Pistis Sophia has spoken.

---

CHAPTER 37

The Savior answered Peter: "Well done, Peter; this is the meaning of her repentance. You are blessed above all people on earth because I have revealed these mysteries to you. Truly, I say to you: I will perfect you completely from the inner mysteries to the outer mysteries and fill you with the spirit, so you will be called 'spiritual, perfected in all fullness.' Truly, I say to you: I will give you all the mysteries of all the regions of my Father and the First Mystery, so that whoever you admit on earth will be admitted into the Light above; and whoever you expel on earth will be expelled from my Father's kingdom in heaven. Listen carefully and pay attention to all the repentances that Pistis Sophia has spoken. She continued and spoke the third repentance, saying:

"O Light of powers, heed me and save me. 

"May those who try to take away my light be in darkness. May those who try to take away my power fall into chaos and be ashamed. 

"May they be quickly cast into darkness, those who press me hard and say: We have become lords over her."Let everyone who seeks the Light rejoice and celebrate, and those who desire your mystery always say: May the mystery be exalted.

Save me now, O Light, for I have lost my light, which they have taken from me, and I lack my power, which they have taken from me. You, O Light, are my savior and my deliverer. Save me quickly from this chaos.

CHAPTER 38

After Jesus had finished speaking these words to his disciples, saying: "This is the third repentance of Pistis Sophia," he said to them: "Let anyone who has a sensitive spirit come forward and speak the thought of the repentance that Pistis Sophia has expressed." 

Before Jesus had finished speaking, Martha came forward, fell at his feet, kissed them, cried aloud, and wept humbly, saying: "My Lord, have mercy on me and show compassion, and let me speak the explanation of the repentance that Pistis Sophia has expressed."

Jesus gave his hand to Martha and said: "Blessed is everyone who humbles themselves, for they shall receive mercy. Therefore, Martha, you are blessed. Proclaim the explanation of the thought of the repentance of Pistis Sophia." 

Martha answered and said to Jesus in front of the disciples: "Concerning the repentance that Pistis Sophia has expressed, my Lord Jesus, your light-power in David prophesied long ago in the sixty-ninth Psalm, saying:

1. O Lord God, pay attention to my help.
2. Let those who seek my soul be put to shame and confused.
3. May those who mock me be turned back and put to shame.
4. May all who seek you be joyful and celebrate because of you, and those who love your salvation always say: May God be exalted.
5. But I am miserable and poor; O Lord, help me.You are my helper and protector; O Lord, do not delay. This is the conclusion of the third repentance that Pistis Sophia expressed, praising the highest power.

CHAPTER 39

When Jesus heard Martha say these words, he responded: "Well said, Martha, and very nicely." Then Jesus continued speaking to his disciples: "Pistis Sophia proceeded with the fourth repentance, reciting it before she was oppressed a second time, to prevent the lion-faced power and all the material emanations sent by Self-willed into chaos from taking away all her light. She expressed this repentance as follows:

"'1. O Light, in whom I have trusted, listen to my repentance, and let my voice reach your dwelling place. "'2. Do not turn your light from me, but pay attention to me if I am oppressed; save me quickly when I call out to you. "'3. For my time has disappeared like a breath, and I have become mere matter. "'4. They have taken my light, and my power is dried up. I have forgotten the mystery I used to perform. "'5. Because of the voice of fear and the power of Self-willed, my power has vanished. "'6. I have become like a demon who dwells in matter without light, and like a counterfeit spirit in a material body without light-power. "'7. I am like a decan who is alone in the air. "'8. The emanations of Self-willed have greatly oppressed me, and my counterpart has thought to himself:

"'9. Instead of being filled with light, she is filled with chaos. I have consumed the sweat of my own matter and the anguish of the tears from my eyes, so that those who oppress me cannot take the rest. "'10. All this has happened to me, O Light, because of your..."Your command has brought me down, and I have descended into chaos, feeling powerless. 

But you, O Lord, are eternal light and visit those who are forever oppressed. 

Now, therefore, O Light, rise and seek the power and soul within me. Your command has been fulfilled, as you decreed during my afflictions. The time has come for you to seek my power and soul, as you planned. 

Your saviors have sought the power within my soul because the appointed time is complete, and its matter needs to be saved. 

At that time, all rulers of the material realms will fear your light, and all beings of the thirteenth material realm will fear the mystery of your light, so others may purify their light. 

The Lord will seek the power of your soul and has revealed his mystery,

So that he may acknowledge the repentance of those in lower regions and has not ignored their repentance. 

This mystery has become a model for the future generations, who will praise the heights. 

For the Light has looked down from its height and will look down on all matter,

To hear the sighs of those in chains and to free the power of the souls whose power is bound,

So that it may place its name in the soul and its mystery in the power."### Chapter 40

While Jesus was speaking to his disciples, he said: "This is the fourth repentance that Pistis Sophia has expressed. Let those who understand, understand."

After Jesus spoke, John approached him, worshiped, and said: "My Lord, allow me to explain the meaning of the fourth repentance that Pistis Sophia has uttered." Jesus replied, "I give you permission to explain the meaning of her repentance."

John then said: "My Lord and Savior, in regard to this repentance that Pistis Sophia has spoken, your divine power, which was in David, prophesied about it long ago in Psalm 101:

1. "Lord, listen to my prayer and let my voice reach you.
2. "Do not turn away from me; listen to me when I am in distress; quickly answer me when I call out to you.
3. "For my days vanish like smoke, and my bones are dry like stone.
4. "I am withered like grass, and my heart is dry; I have even forgotten to eat.
5. "From my groaning, my bones cling to my flesh.
6. "I am like a pelican in the desert, like an owl in a ruined house.
7. "I stay awake all night; I am like a lonely bird on the roof.
8. "My enemies insult me all day long, and even those who honor me have hurt me.
9. "I have eaten ashes instead of bread and mixed my drink with tears,
10. "Because of your anger and wrath; you have lifted me up and thrown me down.
11. "My days are like a shadow that declines, and I am withered like grass.
12. "But you, O Lord, will endure forever, and your name will be remembered for generations.
13.Arise and have mercy upon Zion, for the time has come to show her mercy; the appointed time is here. 

14. Your servants have longed for her stones and will pity her land. 
15. The nations will fear the name of the Lord, and the kings of the earth will respect your sovereignty. 
16. The Lord will rebuild Zion and reveal himself in his glory. 
17. He has listened to the prayers of the humble and has not ignored their pleas. 
18. This will be recorded for future generations, and the people yet to be created will praise the Lord. 
19. Because he has looked down from his holy height; the Lord has looked down from heaven to earth,

20. To hear the groans of the prisoners and to free those condemned to death,
21. To declare the name of the Lord in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem.

This, my Lord, is the explanation of the repentance that Pistis Sophia has spoken.

CHAPTER 41

When John finished speaking these words to Jesus among his disciples, Jesus said to him: "Well said, John, the Virgin, who will rule in the kingdom of Light." Jesus then continued and said to his disciples: "Once again, the emanations of Self-willed oppressed Pistis Sophia in the chaos and tried to take all her light from her; and her deliverance was not yet complete, and the command to save her had not yet reached me through the First Mystery. When all the material emanations of Self-willed oppressed her, she cried out and uttered her fifth repentance, saying:

1. Light of my salvation, I praise you in the highest regions and also in the chaos.I sing praise to you in my hymn, the same hymn I sang in the heights and in the chaos. Let it reach your presence and listen, O Light, to my repentance.

3. My power is filled with darkness, and my light has descended into chaos.

4. I have become like the rulers of chaos, who have fallen into darkness; I am like a material body with no one in the heights to save it.

5. I am also like materials whose power has been taken away, cast into chaos, not saved by you, and condemned by your command.

6. They have put me into the darkness below, into lifeless and powerless matters.

7. You have brought your command upon me and everything you decreed.

8. Your spirit has withdrawn and abandoned me. By your command, the emanations of my eon have not helped me; they have hated me and separated from me, yet I am not utterly destroyed.

9. My light within me has diminished, and I have cried out to the light with all my remaining light, stretching out my hands to you.

10. So now, O Light, will you not fulfill your command in the chaos? Will the deliverers not arise in the darkness according to your command and come to be your disciples?

11. Will they not declare the mystery of your name in the chaos?

12. Or will they not instead declare your name in a matter of chaos that you will not purify?

13. But I have sung praises to you, O Light, and my repentance will reach you in the heights.

14. Let your light come upon me,

15. For they have taken my light, and I am in pain because of the Light since the time I was emanated.### CHAPTER 42

After Jesus had spoken these words to his disciples, he said, "Anyone who has ears to hear, let them hear; and let those whose spirits are stirred come forward and explain the meaning of Pistis Sophia's fifth repentance."

When Jesus finished speaking, Philip stepped forward. He held up and laid down the book he was carrying, for he was the scribe who recorded all of Jesus' teachings and actions. Philip then said to Jesus, "My Lord, surely I am not the only one tasked with taking care of the world and writing down everything we say and do? You have not allowed me to come forward and explain the mysteries of Pistis Sophia's repentance. Many times, my spirit has been stirred, urging me to step forward and speak about the repentance of Pistis Sophia, but I couldn't because I am responsible for recording all the teachings."When Jesus heard Philip, he said to him, "Listen, Philip, blessed one, so I can speak with you. It is you, Thomas, and Matthew who are tasked by the First Mystery to record all my teachings, actions, and everything you witness. Your task of recording these teachings is not yet complete. When it is done, you can step forward and speak as you wish. Therefore, the three of you must write down everything I say and do, and all that you see, so that you can bear witness to the kingdom of heaven."

CHAPTER 43

After Jesus said this, he told his disciples, "Anyone with ears to hear should listen." Mary then stepped forward, stood next to Philip, and said to Jesus, "My Lord, I am ready to listen and understand your words. You said, 'Anyone with ears to hear should listen.' Regarding what you told Philip—that he, Thomas, and Matthew are appointed by the First Mystery to write down all the teachings of the kingdom of Light and bear witness—let me explain. This fulfills the prophecy given through Moses: 'By two or three witnesses, every matter will be established.' The three witnesses are Philip, Thomas, and Matthew." When Jesus heard this, he said, "Well said, Mary, that is the correct interpretation."Now, therefore, Philip, come forward and explain the fifth repentance of Pistis Sophia. After that, sit down and write all the teachings I will give until you have completed your part of recording the words of the Kingdom of Light. Then you can come forward and speak what you understand. But first, declare the solution of the fifth repentance of Pistis Sophia.

Philip answered Jesus, "My Lord, listen as I explain her repentance. Your power previously prophesied about it through David in Psalm 87, saying:

1. Lord, God of my salvation, I have cried to you day and night.
2. Let my weeping come before you; listen to my plea, O Lord.
3. My soul is full of evil, and my life is close to the world below.
4. I am counted among those who have gone down into the pit; I am like a man with no helper.
5. I am among the dead, like the slain who are discarded and sleep in tombs, whom you no longer remember, and they are destroyed by your hands.
6. You have placed me in a pit, in darkness and the shadow of death.
7. Your wrath has settled upon me, and all your cares have overwhelmed me. (Selah)
8. You have distanced my acquaintances from me; they have made me an abomination. They have abandoned me, and I cannot go out.
9. My eyes are dim with misery; I have cried to you, O Lord, all day and have stretched out my hands to you.
10. Will you not perform your wonders for the dead? Will the physicians not rise and praise you?
11. Will they not proclaim your name in the tombs,
12. And your righteousness in a forgotten land?
13. But I have cried to you, O Lord, and my prayer will reach you early in the morning.---

Please do not turn your face away from me.  
"For I am miserable and have been in sorrow since my youth. When I tried to exalt myself, I humbled myself and rose again.  
"Your anger has come upon me and your terrors have deluded me.  
"They have surrounded me like water and have seized me all day long.  
"You have kept my companions far from me and my acquaintances away from my misery."  
This is the explanation of the fifth repentance that Pistis Sophia expressed when she was oppressed in chaos.

CHAPTER 44

When Jesus heard Philip speak these words, he said, "Well said, Philip, my beloved. Now, come and take your seat to write down all the discourses I will speak, everything I do, and all that you will see." Philip sat down and wrote. Then Jesus continued speaking to his disciples: "Pistis Sophia cried to the Light. The Light forgave her sin for leaving her region and descending into darkness. She uttered the sixth repentance, saying:

"I have sung praises to you, O Light, in the darkness below.  
Hear my repentance, and may your light listen to my plea.  
O Light, if you remember my sin, I will not be able to stand before you, and you will abandon me,  
For you, O Light, are my savior; because of the light of your name, I have had faith in you, O Light.  
My power has had faith in your mystery; it trusted in the Light when it was among those of the height, and it trusted in it when it was in the chaos below.  
Let all the powers in me trust in the Light when I am in the darkness below, and may they trust in the Light again if they come into the region of the height."

---**Chapter 45**

After Jesus finished speaking these words to his disciples, he asked them, "Do you understand how I am speaking to you?" Andrew stepped forward and said, "My Lord, regarding the interpretation of the sixth repentance of Pistis Sophia, your light-power prophesied through David in the one-hundred-and-twenty-ninth Psalm, saying:

1. "Out of the depths I have cried to you, O Lord.
2. Listen to my voice; let your ears pay attention to my plea for mercy.
3. O Lord, if you keep track of sins, who can stand?
4. But forgiveness is in your hands; for the sake of your name, I have waited for you, O Lord.
5. My soul has waited for your word.
6. My soul has hoped in the Lord from morning until evening. Let Israel hope in the Lord from morning until evening.
7. For grace is with the Lord, and with him is great redemption.
8. And he will deliver Israel from all his sins."

Jesus said to him, "Well said, Andrew, blessed one. This is the interpretation of her repentance. Truly, I say to you: I will complete you in all mysteries of the Light and all knowledge, from the innermost to the outermost, from the Ineffable to the deepest darkness, from the Light of lights down to the darkest of darknesses."From all the gods down to the demons, from all the lords down to the decans, from all the authorities down to the servants, from the creation of humans to that of wild beasts, cattle, and reptiles, so that you may be called perfect, perfected in all fullness. Amen, amen, I say to you: In the place where I will be in the kingdom of my Father, you will also be with me. And when the perfect number is reached, and the Mixture is dissolved, I will command that all tyrant gods, who haven't given up the purification of their light, be brought, and I will instruct the wise fire, over which the perfect pass, to consume those tyrants until they give up the last bit of their light.

When Jesus finished speaking these words to his disciples, he asked them, "Do you understand what I am saying to you?" Mary replied, "Yes, Lord, I have understood your words. Concerning what you said about the dissolution of the Mixture, you will take your seat on a light-power, and we, your disciples, will sit on your right, and you will judge the tyrant gods who haven't given up the purification of their light. The wise fire will consume them until they surrender the last light within them. This word, your light-power, was prophesied through David in the eighty-first Psalm, saying:

'God shall sit in the assembly of the gods and judge the gods.'"

Jesus said to her, "Well said, Mary."CHAPTER 46

Jesus continued speaking to his disciples: "When Pistis Sophia completed her sixth repentance seeking forgiveness for her transgression, she looked up to see if her sins were forgiven and if she would be led out of chaos. However, by the command of the First Mystery, she was not yet heard, and her sins were not forgiven, nor was she led out of chaos. When she looked up to see if her repentance was accepted, she saw the rulers of the twelve aeons mocking and rejoicing over her because her repentance was not accepted. Seeing them mock her, she became very distressed and cried out in her seventh repentance, saying:

"'1. O Light, I have lifted up my power to you, my Light. 
"'2. I have faith in you. Do not let me be scorned; do not let the rulers of the twelve aeons, who hate me, rejoice over me. 
"'3. All who have faith in you shall not be put to shame. Let those who have taken away my power remain in darkness; let them gain no profit from it, but let it be taken away from them.
"'4. O Light, show me your ways, and I will be saved through them; show me your paths, so I can be saved from the chaos.
"'5. Guide me in your light, and let me know, O Light, that you are my savior. I will trust you all my life. 
"'6. Save me, O Light, for your mercy endures forever. 
"'7. For my transgression, which I committed in ignorance from the beginning, do not hold it against me, O Light, but save me through your great mystery of the forgiveness of sins because of your goodness, O Light. 
"'8. The Light is good and sincere. For this reason, it will show me the way to be saved from my transgression.'"And for my powers, which are weakened by the fear of Self-willed's material influences, it will come near after its command and will teach my weakened powers its knowledge because of the merciless. 

For all knowledge of the Light brings salvation and holds mysteries for those who seek its inheritance and secrets. For the sake of your name's mystery, O Light, forgive my great transgression. To everyone who trusts in the Light, it will give the mystery that suits them. 

And their soul will dwell in the regions of the Light, and their power will inherit the Treasury of the Light. The Light gives power to those who have faith in it, and the mystery of its name belongs to those who trust in it. It will show them the region of the Inheritance, which is in the Treasury of the Light. But I have always had faith in the Light, for it will save me from the bonds of darkness. 

Listen to me, O Light, and save me, for they have taken away my name in the chaos. Because of all the emanations, my afflictions and oppression have greatly increased. Save me from my transgression and this darkness. Look upon my suffering and forgive my transgression. Pay attention to the rulers of the twelve aeons, who hate me out of jealousy. Watch over my power and save me, and do not let me remain in this darkness, for I have had faith in you. They have made a fool of me for having faith in you, O Light. Now, therefore, O Light, save my powers from the influences of Self-willed, by whom I am oppressed.

"Now, therefore, let those who are sober stay sober." When Jesus had said this to his disciples, Thomas stepped forward and said: "My Lord, I am sober, I am very sober, and my spirit is ready within me. I am exceedingly glad that you have revealed these words to us."I have been patient with my brothers until now so as not to anger them. Instead, I have waited for each one to come before you and speak about the repentance of Pistis Sophia. Now, my Lord, regarding the seventh repentance of Pistis Sophia, your light-power has prophesied through the prophet David in the 24th Psalm, as follows:

1. O Lord, I lift up my soul to you, O my God.
2. I have placed my trust in you; do not let me be put to shame, and do not let my enemies mock me.
3. All who wait on you will not be put to shame; let those who do wrong without cause be put to shame.
4. O Lord, show me your ways and teach me your paths.
5. Lead me in your truth and teach me, for you are my God and my savior; I will wait on you all day long.
6. Remember your mercies, O Lord, and your grace, for they are eternal.
7. Do not remember the sins of my youth or my ignorance. Remember me according to your great mercy because of your goodness, O Lord.
8. The Lord is gracious and sincere; he will instruct sinners in the right way.
9. He will guide the humble in judgment and teach them his ways.
10. All the ways of the Lord are grace and truth for those who seek his righteousness and testimonies.
11. For your name's sake, O Lord, forgive my great sin.
12. Who is the person who fears the Lord? He will guide them in the way they should choose.
13. Their soul will prosper, and their descendants will inherit the land.
14. The Lord is the strength of those who fear him; his name belongs to them who fear him, to reveal his covenant to them.
15. My eyes are always on the Lord, for he will free my feet from the snare.Look down on me and be gracious, for I am alone and miserable. The troubles in my heart have increased; bring me out of my difficulties. Look at my suffering and sorrow, and forgive all my sins. See how my enemies have multiplied and hate me unjustly. Protect my soul and save me; do not let me be ashamed, for I have hoped in you. The innocent and sincere have joined me, for I have waited on you, O Lord. God, deliver Israel from all his troubles."

After hearing Thomas's words, Jesus said: "Well said, Thomas. This is the meaning of the seventh repentance of Pistis Sophia. Truly, I tell you: All generations will bless you because I have revealed this to you, and you have received my spirit and become understanding and spiritual. From now on, I will fill you with the complete light and power of the spirit, so you can understand everything that will be said to you and that you will see. Soon, I will speak to you about the higher mysteries."

CHAPTER 47

Jesus continued speaking to his disciples: "When Pistis Sophia uttered the seventh repentance in the chaos, the command to save her through the First Mystery had not yet come to me. However, out of compassion, I led her to a somewhat spacious region in the chaos, even without a command. When the material forces of Self-willed noticed that she had been led to a more spacious area in the chaos, they stopped oppressing her as much, thinking she would soon be led out of the chaos altogether."When this happened, Pistis Sophia did not know that I was helping her; she didn't recognize me at all. She kept praising the Light of the Treasury, which she had seen before and believed in, thinking it was the same Light that was aiding her. Because she had faith in the true Light of the Treasury, she will eventually be rescued from the chaos and her repentance will be accepted. However, the command of the First Mystery had not yet been fulfilled to accept her repentance. Listen as I explain everything that happened to Pistis Sophia.

When I brought her to a more spacious area within the chaos, the forces of Self-willed stopped oppressing her, thinking she would be freed from the chaos completely. But when they noticed she wasn't being freed, they resumed their intense oppression. Because of this, she made her eighth repentance, as they continued to oppress her harshly. She prayed:

"1. I have hoped in you, O Light. Do not leave me in the chaos; deliver and save me with your wisdom.
2. Listen to me and save me. Be my savior, O Light, and lead me to your light.
3. You are my savior and will bring me to you. Because of the mystery of your name, lead me and give me your mystery.
4. Save me from this lion-faced power that ensnares me, for you are my savior.
5. In your hands, I place the purification of my light; you have saved me, O Light, with your wisdom."You have become angry with those who watch over me and cannot completely capture me. But I have had faith in the Light.

7. I will rejoice and sing praises because you have shown mercy to me, listened to me, and saved me from the oppression I was in. You will free my power from the chaos.

8. You have not left me in the hands of the lion-faced power; instead, you have led me to a place where there is no oppression.

CHAPTER 48

After Jesus said this to his disciples, he continued: "It happened that when the lion-faced power noticed Pistis Sophia had not been completely lifted out of chaos, it returned with all the other material emanations of Self-willed, and they oppressed Pistis Sophia again. When they oppressed her, she cried out in repentance, saying:

9. Have mercy on me, O Light, for they have oppressed me again. Because of your command, the light within me is disturbed, along with my power and understanding.

10. My power has started to weaken while I am in these afflictions and in the chaos. My light is diminished, as they have taken my power from me, and all my powers are unsettled.

11. I have become powerless in front of all the rulers of the aeons who hate me, and in front of the twenty-four emanations in whose region I was. My brother, my pair, was afraid to help me because of the situation they put me in.

12. All the rulers of the heights see me as matter with no light. I have become like a material power that has fallen from the rulers.

13. All those in the aeons said: She has become chaos. Then, all the merciless powers surrounded me, intending to take away all the light within me.Sure, here is the text converted into modern English, corrected, and simplified without changing its original meaning:

---

But I have trusted in you, O Light, and said: You are my savior. My commandment, which you have decreed for me, is in your hands. Save me from the hands of the Self-willed emanations that oppress and persecute me. Send your light over me, for I am nothing before you, and save me according to your compassion. Let me not be despised, for I have sung praises to you, O Light. Let chaos cover the Self-willed emanations; let them be led into darkness. Shut the mouths of those who would deceive and devour me, who say: Let us take all the light in her, though I have done them no harm.

---

Chapter 49

And when Jesus had spoken, Matthew came forward and said: "My Lord, your spirit has stirred me and your light has made me clear-minded to proclaim this eighth repentance of Pistis Sophia. For your power prophesied it earlier through David in the thirtieth Psalm, saying:

"'1. In you, O Lord, I have hoped. Let me never be put to shame; save me according to your righteousness. "'2. Listen to me, save me quickly. Be my protecting God and a house of refuge to save me. "'3. For you are my support and my refuge; for your name's sake, you will guide and feed me. "'4. You will draw me out of this snare, which they have secretly laid for me; for you are my protection. "'5. Into your hands, I commit my spirit; you have redeemed me, O Lord, God of Truth. "'6. You hate those who hold onto vain emptiness, but I have trusted you. "'7. I will rejoice because of my Lord and celebrate your grace. For you have looked down upon my humility and saved my soul from my troubles. "'8. You have not handed me over to my enemies; you have set my feet in a broad space. "'9. Be gracious to me, O Lord, for I am afflicted; my eye is troubled with grief, as are my soul and my body.'"

This version preserves the original meanings and sentiments while updating the language for modern readers.Here is the text converted into modern English, corrected, and simplified without altering its original meaning:

---

10. My years have wasted away in sadness, and my life is filled with sighing. My strength is weakened by misery, and my bones are distressed.

11. I have become a mockery to all my enemies and my neighbors. I have become a fright to my acquaintances, and those who saw me have fled from me.

12. I am forgotten in their hearts like a dead person, and I have become like a broken vessel.

13. I have heard the scorn of many who surround me. They gather together against me and plot to take my life.

14. But I have trusted in you, O Lord. I said: You are my God.

15. My fate is in your hands. Save me from my enemies and free me from my persecutors.

16. Show your favor to me, your servant, and save me by your grace, O Lord.

17. Do not let me be put to shame, for I have called out to you. Let the wicked be put to shame and turn towards hell.

18. Let the deceitful lips be silenced, those who speak against the righteous in pride and scorn.

CHAPTER 50

And when Jesus heard these words, he said: "Well said, Matthew. Now, truly, I say to you: When the perfect number is completed and the universe is raised, I will take my seat in the Treasury of the Light, and you will sit on twelve light-powers, until we have restored all the orders of the twelve saviors to their rightful places."

After saying this, he asked: "Do you understand what I am saying?" Mary came forward and said: "Lord, regarding this matter, you have previously told us in a parable: 'You have stayed with me through my trials, and I will give you a kingdom, just as my Father has given to me, so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and you will sit on twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel.'"

He said to her: "Well said, Mary."Jesus continued speaking to his disciples and said: "After the Self-willed powers in the chaos oppressed Pistis Sophia, she spoke her ninth repentance, saying:

"'1. O Light, destroy those who have taken my power and take their power away. "'2. For I am your power and your light. Come and save me. "'3. Let great darkness cover my oppressors. Tell my power: I am the one who will save you. "'4. Let those who want to take my light lose their power. Let them be powerless and return to chaos. "'5. Let their power become dust, and let your angel, Yew, strike them. "'6. If they try to ascend, let darkness seize them and drag them back to chaos. Let your angel Yew chase them and cast them into the darkness below. "'7. They have set a lion-faced power as a trap for me, though I have done no wrong. They seek to take my light, but they won't succeed. "'8. Therefore, O Light, take away the purification from the lion-faced power without its knowledge. Remove its light, as Self-willed intended to take my light. "'9. But my power will rejoice in the Light and celebrate its salvation. "'10. All parts of my power will declare: There is no savior but you. You will save me from the lion-faced power that took my power and light. "'11. They have lied about me, saying I know the mystery of the Light in the height, in which I have believed.And they have pressured me, saying: Tell us the mystery of the Light above, which I do not know. They have repaid me with all this harm because I have had faith in the Light above, and they have drained my power. 

But when they pressured me, I sat in darkness, my soul mourning. And you, O Light, I praise you for this reason—save me. I know you will save me because I have always followed your will since I was in my realm. I have followed your will like the invisible beings in my region, and like my counterpart. I mourned, constantly looking and searching for the Light.

Now, all the emanations of Self-willed have surrounded me, rejoiced over me, and severely oppressed me without my understanding them. They fled and ceased their attacks but showed no mercy. They returned and tested me, oppressed me greatly, and ground their teeth against me, wanting to take away my light completely.

How long, O Light, will you let them oppress me? Save my power from their evil thoughts and save me from the lion-faced power; for I am the only one of the invisibles in this region. I will sing praises to you, O Light, in the midst of all who gather against me, and I will cry out to you among all who oppress me.

Now, O Light, do not let those who hate me and wish to take away my power rejoice over me—they who hate me and glare at me, although I have done nothing to them. They have flattered me with sweet words, asking me about the mysteries of the Light that I do not know, and have deceitfully spoken against me and been enraged because I have had faith in the Light above. They have opened their mouths against me and said...We will take away her light. 

22. Now, therefore, O Light, you know their deceit; do not allow them to succeed and stay close to help me. 23. Quickly, O Light, defend and avenge me, 

24. And judge me according to your goodness. Now, therefore, O Light of lights, do not let them take away my light from me, 

25. And do not let them say in their hearts: Our power is satisfied with her light. And do not let them say: We have consumed her power. 26. Instead, let darkness come upon them, and let those who wish to take away my light become powerless, and let them be engulfed in chaos and darkness, who say: We will take away her light and her power. 27. Now, therefore, save me so I can rejoice, for I long for the thirteenth aeon, the region of Righteousness, and I will say forever: May the light of your angel Yew shine more and more. 28. And my tongue will sing praises to you in your knowledge for all my time in the thirteenth aeon.

It happened, when Jesus had finished saying these words to his disciples, that he said to them: "Who among you is clear-minded, let him explain the solution." James came forward, kissed Jesus' chest, and said: "My Lord, your spirit has made me clear-minded, and I am ready to explain the solution. Concerning this, your power has prophesied through David in the thirty-fourth Psalm, referring to the ninth repentance of Pistis Sophia:

1. Give judgment, O Lord, on those who wrong me, and fight against those who fight against me. 2. Take up weapon and shield and stand up to help me. 3. Draw forth a sword and conceal it from my oppressors. Say to my soul: I am your salvation. 4. Let them be put to shame and embarrassed who seek my soul; let them fall back and be put to shame who think evil against me. 5. Let them be as chaff.Before the wind, let the angel of the Lord chase them. 

6. Let their path be dark and slippery, and let the angel of the Lord oppress them. 

7. For they have set a trap for me without cause, and they have mocked me in vain. 

8. Let an unexpected trap catch them, and let them fall into the snare they set for me. 

9. But I will rejoice in the Lord and celebrate His salvation. 

10. My whole being will say: "O Lord, who is like You? You rescue the poor from those too strong for them, the poor and needy from those who rob them."

11. Unjust witnesses came forward and questioned me about things I knew nothing of. 

12. They repaid me evil for good and left me feeling desolate. 

13. But when they troubled me, I wore sackcloth and humbled myself with fasting, and my prayer returned to me. 

14. I was devoted to You like a friend or brother; I mourned as though in sorrow for my own family.

15. They rejoiced over my distress and gathered against me without my knowledge; they attacked and troubled me. 

16. They mocked me and gnashed their teeth at me.

17. O Lord, when will You look upon me? Rescue my soul from their evil deeds and save me from these enemies.

18. I will praise You, O Lord, in the great assembly and sing Your praises among many people.

19. Do not let those who wrongfully oppose me rejoice over me, nor let those who hate me without reason mock me.

20. For they speak peaceably with me, but in their hearts, they plot harm.They opened their mouths wide against me and said: "Look, our eyes have seen him."

22. You have seen, O Lord. Do not stay silent, O Lord, do not withdraw from me.

23. Arise, O Lord, and pay attention to my vindication and my cause, my God and my Lord.

24. Judge me, O Lord, according to your justice; do not let them rejoice over me, my God.

25. Do not let them say: "Well done, we have defeated him."

26. Let those who rejoice at my misfortune be put to shame and dishonor. Let those who speak arrogantly against me be covered with shame and disgrace.

27. Let those who desire my righteousness rejoice and be glad. Let those who seek my peace say: "May the Lord be praised."

28. My tongue will celebrate your righteousness and your honor all day long.

CHAPTER 52

After James said this, Jesus replied: "Well said, James. This is the meaning of the ninth repentance of Pistis Sophia. Truly, I tell you, you will be the first in the kingdom of heaven before all invisible beings, all gods, and rulers in the thirteenth and twelfth aeons. Not only you, but anyone who fulfills my mysteries will also be first."

Then he asked them: "Do you understand how I speak to you?"

Mary stepped forward and said: "Yes, Lord, this is what you told us earlier: 'The last shall be first and the first shall be last.' The first created were the invisible beings, gods, and rulers, for they existed before humanity. But those who receive mysteries will be first in the kingdom of heaven."

Jesus said to her: "Well said, Mary."Jesus continued speaking to his disciples: "When Pistis Sophia had proclaimed her ninth repentance, the lion-faced power oppressed her again, trying to take away all her powers. She cried out to the Light, saying:

"'O Light, in whom I have had faith from the beginning, for whose sake I have endured these great pains, help me.'

"At that moment, her repentance was accepted. The First Mystery heard her, and I was sent at His command. I came to help her and led her out of chaos because she had repented and had faith in the Light, enduring great pains and dangers. She had been deceived by the god-like Self-willed, and not by anything else, except for a light-power that resembled the Light she believed in. For this reason, I was sent to help her secretly. I did not go to the region of the aeons but passed through them without any power noticing, except the First Mystery.

"When I entered the chaos to help her, she saw me. I was full of understanding, shone brightly, and had compassion for her. I was not self-willed like the lion-faced power, which had taken away her light-power and oppressed her to take all the light from her. Sophia saw that I shone much more brightly than the lion-faced power and that I was compassionate. She realized I came from the highest place, in whose light she had believed from the beginning. Pistis Sophia then found courage and uttered her tenth repentance, saying:

"'1.'"I have cried out to you, O Light of lights, in my suffering, and you have listened to me.

2. O Light, save me from unjust and deceitful words and from cunning traps.

3. The light that was being taken from me through deceitful means will not be brought to you.

4. For the traps of the Self-willed and the snares of the merciless are set out.

5. Woe to me, that my dwelling was far away, and I was in the chaos.

6. My power was in regions that are not mine.

7. I pleaded with those merciless ones; and when I pleaded with them, they fought against me without reason.

CHAPTER 53

After Jesus said this to his disciples, he told them: "Now, let anyone whose spirit is moved come forward and explain the tenth repentance of Pistis Sophia." Peter responded: "O Lord, your light-power was prophesied by David in the one-hundred-and-nineteenth Psalm, saying:

1. I cried out to you, O Lord, in my suffering, and you listened to me.

2. O Lord, save my soul from unjust words and deceitful tongues.

3. What will be given to you or added to you with a deceitful tongue?

4. The arrows of the strong are made sharp with the coal of the desert.

5. Woe to me, that my dwelling is far away, and I lived in the tents of Kedar.

6. My soul has lived in many regions as a guest.

7. I was peaceful with those who hate peace; if I spoke to them, they fought against me without reason.

This, O Lord, is the explanation of the tenth repentance of Pistis Sophia, which she uttered when the material emanations of the Self-willed and his lion-faced power oppressed her greatly." Jesus said to him: "Well said, Peter. This is the explanation of the tenth repentance of Pistis Sophia."### Chapter 54

Jesus continued speaking to his disciples: "When the lion-faced power saw me approaching Pistis Sophia, shining very brightly, it became even more furious and created many extremely violent emanations. As this happened, Pistis Sophia uttered her eleventh repentance, saying:

1. Why has the mighty power risen in evil?
2. Its plotting constantly takes away my light, like sharp iron taking away my strength.
3. I chose to descend into chaos rather than stay in the thirteenth aeon, the region of Righteousness.
4. They wanted to cunningly lead me to consume all my light.
5. Because of this, the Light will take away all their light and their entire matter will be destroyed. It will take away their light, not allowing them to stay in the thirteenth aeon, their dwelling place, and will not include their name among those who will live.
6. The twenty-four emanations will see what has happened to you, lion-faced power, and will be afraid. They will not be disobedient but will give the purification of their light.
7. They will see you and rejoice, saying: Look, an emanation that did not give the purification of its light to be saved, but boasted in the abundance of its power's light, saying it would take away the light from Pistis Sophia, which will now be taken from it."

"Now, let the one whose power is raised come forward and explain the eleventh repentance of Pistis Sophia."

Then Salome came forward and said: "My Lord, your light-power previously prophesied through David in the fifty-first Psalm, saying:

1. Why does the mighty one boast of his wickedness?"Your tongue has spoken evil all day long, like a sharp razor practicing deceit. You loved wickedness more than goodness, and preferred speaking lies over truth. You loved all words that deceive and a deceitful tongue. Therefore, God will utterly destroy you, uproot you from your home, and remove you from among the living. The righteous will see and be afraid, and they will mock you, saying:

"Look, a man who did not make God his helper, but trusted in his great wealth and was proud in his vanity. But I am like a fruitful olive tree in the house of God. I have trusted in God's grace forever. And I will praise You, for You have dealt faithfully with me; and I will wait on Your name, for it is good in the presence of Your holy ones."

This, my Lord, is the solution to the eleventh repentance of Pistis Sophia. Your light-power has awakened me, and I have spoken according to Your will." When Jesus heard these words from Salome, he said: "Well said, Salome. Truly, I say to you: I will perfect you in all mysteries of the kingdom of Light."

CHAPTER 55

Jesus continued speaking to his disciples: "Then it happened that I approached the chaos, shining very brightly, to take away the light from that lion-faced power. As I shone brightly, it was afraid and cried out to its self-willed god for help. Immediately, the self-willed god looked out from the thirteenth aeon, down into the chaos, very angry and wanting to help his lion-faced power. Immediately, the lion-faced power and all its emanations surrounded it.Pistis Sophia wanted to take away the whole light in Sophia. When they oppressed Sophia, she cried out for help to the highest point. Looking up, she saw Self-willed very angry, and this made her afraid. She then made her twelfth plea for help because of Self-willed and his followers. She cried out to me, saying:

"1. Oh Light, don't forget my songs of praise.
2. Self-willed and his lion-faced power have opened their mouths against me and acted deceitfully.
3. They have surrounded me, wanting to take away my power and hating me because I praised you.
4. Instead of loving me, they slandered me. But I continued to sing praises.
5. They plotted to take away my power because I praised you, Oh Light, and hated me because I loved you.
6. Let darkness come over Self-willed, and let the ruler of the outermost darkness stay at his right hand.
7. When you judge, take away his power and take his light from him as he tried to take mine.
8. Let all his light powers fade, and let another of the three triple-powers take his place.
9. May all his emanations be without light, and let his substance be lightless.
10. May his emanations stay in chaos and not dare to go to their region. May their light fade away, and let them not reach the thirteenth aeon, their region.
11. May the Receiver, the Purifier of the lights, purify all the lights in Self-willed and take them away.
12. May the rulers of the lower darkness control his emanations, and let no one give them shelter; let no one listen to their power in chaos."Take away the light from his beings and erase their name from the thirteenth realm. Remove his name from that region forever.

14. Let the lion-faced power bear the sin of the one who created it before the Light, and do not erase the wrongdoing of the one who brought him forth (Self-willed).

15. May their sin always be before the Light, and do not let them look beyond the chaos or remove their names from any regions.

16. They did not spare me and oppressed the one whose light and power they took away. They wanted to take all my light from me. 

17. They loved to descend into chaos, so let them stay there and never be brought back. They did not want to live in the region of Righteousness, and they will not be taken there from now on.

18. He wore darkness like a garment, and it entered him like water and oil into all his powers.

19. Let him wrap himself in chaos like a garment and wear darkness like a leather belt forever.

20. Let this happen to those who did this to me for the Light's sake and said: Let's take away all her power.

21. But you, O Light, have mercy on me for the sake of your name's mystery, and save me with your grace.

22. They took away my light and power; I couldn't stand strong among them.

23. I have become like fallen matter, tossed around like a demon in the air.

24. My power has perished because I have no mystery; my matter has dwindled because my light was taken away.

25. They mocked me, nodding at me.

26. Help me according to your mercy.Now, let anyone who is ready come forward and share the solution to the twelfth repentance of Pistis Sophia.

CHAPTER 56

Andrew stepped forward and said, "My Lord and Savior, your light-power has previously prophesied through David about this repentance that Pistis Sophia has expressed, as it is written in the one-hundred-and-eighth Psalm:

1. God, do not be silent at my praise.

2. For the mouths of sinners and deceivers have opened against me and spoken deceitfully behind my back.
3. They have surrounded me with hateful words and fought against me without reason.
4. Instead of loving me, they have slandered me. But I prayed.
5. They repaid my good with evil and my love with hatred.
6. Appoint a sinner over him, and let an accuser stand at his right hand.
7. When he is judged, let him be found guilty, and may his prayers be counted as sin.
8. May his days be few, and let another take his position.
9. May his children become orphans and his wife a widow.
10. May his children be homeless and beg, driven from their ruined homes.
11. May creditors seize all he has, and may strangers plunder his efforts.
12. Let no one show him kindness or take pity on his orphans.
13. May his descendants be cut off and his name erased in a single generation.
14. Let the guilt of his fathers be remembered before the Lord, and the sin of his mother never be blotted out.
15. May these sins always be before the Lord, and may his memory be wiped out from the earth;

16. Because he did not show mercy but persecuted the poor and needy and sought to kill the brokenhearted.
17. He loved cursing, so let it come to him. He did not delight in blessing, so let it be far from him.He dressed himself in curses like a garment, and they entered his body like water and penetrated his bones like oil. 

19. May it be like clothing that he always wears, and like a belt he is always girded with.

20. This is the fate of those who slander me before the Lord and speak wickedly against my soul.

21. But you, O Lord God, be gracious to me; save me for the sake of your name.

22. For I am poor and miserable; my heart is in turmoil within me.

23. I am fading away like a shadow at sunset; I am shaken off like a locust.

24. My knees are weak from fasting, and my body is gaunt from lack of nourishment.

25. I have become a joke to them; they see me and shake their heads.

26. Help me, O Lord God, and save me according to your grace.

27. Let them know that this is your doing, that you, O Lord, have done it.

This is the prayer of the twelfth repentance which Pistis Sophia spoke when she was in chaos.

CHAPTER 57

And Jesus continued speaking to his disciples: "It happened again that Pistis Sophia cried out to me, saying:

'O Light of lights, I have sinned in the twelve aeons and descended from them; therefore, I have uttered the twelve repentances, one for each aeon. Now, O Light of lights, forgive me my great sin, for I have left the high regions and come to dwell in chaos.' When Pistis Sophia said this, she continued with the thirteenth repentance, saying:

1. Listen to me singing praises to you, O Light of lights."Listen to me as I express my repentance for the thirteenth aeon, the place from which I have descended, so that the thirteenth repentance of the thirteenth aeon can be completed—those aeons which I have passed through and descended from.

Now, therefore, O Light of lights, hear me as I sing praises to you in the thirteenth aeon, my place of origin from which I have descended.

Save me, O Light, through your great mystery and forgive my transgressions with your forgiveness.

Grant me baptism, forgive my sins, and purify me from my wrongdoing.

My transgression is the lion-faced power, which cannot be hidden from you; it is because of this that I have descended.

I alone among the invisible beings, in whose regions I was, have transgressed and descended into chaos. Furthermore, I have transgressed so that your commandment may be fulfilled.

This, then, is what Pistis Sophia said. Now, let anyone whose spirit urges them to understand her words come forward and explain her thoughts. 

Martha stepped forward and said: "My Lord, my spirit urges me to explain what Pistis Sophia has spoken; your power has prophesied about it through David in the fiftieth Psalm, saying:

Be gracious to me, O God, according to your great grace; according to the fullness of your mercy, erase my sin.

Wash me from my iniquity.

And may my sin always be before you,

So that you may be justified in your words and prevail when you judge me.

This is the meaning of the words that Pistis Sophia has spoken."

Jesus said to her: "Well said, Martha, blessed one."CHAPTER 58

Jesus continued speaking to his disciples: "When Pistis Sophia had spoken, the time had come for her to be rescued from the chaos. On my own, without the help of the First Mystery, I sent a light-power from within myself down to the chaos to guide Pistis Sophia out of the deep chaos and bring her to the higher regions of it. This was until the First Mystery would command that she be completely freed from the chaos. My light-power led Pistis Sophia to the higher regions of the chaos.

When the beings of Self-willed saw that Pistis Sophia was being led to the higher regions, they quickly followed her, trying to bring her back down to the lower chaos. But my light-power, which I had sent to help her, shone very brightly. As the Self-willed beings chased Sophia when she was in the higher regions of the chaos, she sang praises and called out to me, saying:

"'1. I will sing praises to you, O Light, because I wanted to come to you. I will sing praises to you, O Light, because you are my savior. "'2. Do not leave me in the chaos. Save me, O Light of the Height, because you are the one I have praised. "'3. You sent me your light from yourself and saved me. You have led me to the higher regions of the chaos. "'4. May the Self-willed beings that chase me sink down into the lower chaos and not reach the higher regions to find me. "'5. May great darkness cover them and deeper gloom surround them. Let them not see me in the light of your power, which you sent to save me, so they cannot control me again.'"Don't let their plan to take away my power succeed. Instead, let them lose their light as they have tried to take mine.

7. They wanted to take all of my light but couldn't because Your light-power was with me.
8. Since they acted without Your command, Light, they couldn't take my light.
9. Because I have faith in the Light, I won't be afraid; the Light is my deliverer, and I won't fear.

Now, let the one whose power is greatest explain the words that Pistis Sophia has spoken. When Jesus finished speaking to his disciples, Salome stepped forward and said, "My Lord, I feel compelled to explain what Pistis Sophia has said. Your power spoke through Solomon, saying:

1. I will thank you, Lord, for you are my God.
2. Don't abandon me, Lord, for you are my hope.
3. You have saved me freely, and I am safe through you.
4. Let my pursuers fall and not see me.
5. Let their eyes be clouded with smoke and mist so they cannot see the day and capture me.
6. May their plans fail and backfire on them.
7. Their plans have not succeeded.
8. They are defeated, even though they are strong, and their wicked schemes have fallen on them.
9. My hope is in the Lord, and I will not be afraid, for you are my God and Savior."

After Salome finished speaking, Jesus said to her, "Well said, Salome. This is the correct explanation of Pistis Sophia's words."### Chapter 59

Jesus continued speaking to his disciples: "When Pistis Sophia finished saying these words in the chaos, I transformed the light-power I had sent to save her into a light-wreath on her head. This wreath prevented the forces of Self-willed from having control over her. As the light-wreath encircled her head, all the evil within her was shaken out and purified. The impurities stayed behind in the chaos, and the forces of Self-willed looked upon them and rejoiced. The pure light within Pistis Sophia empowered the light-wreath around her head.

"When the light-wreath surrounded the pure light in Sophia, her pure light did not leave it, preventing the forces of Self-willed from stealing it. As this happened, Sophia's pure light began to sing praises. She praised my light-power, which was now a wreath around her head, and sang:

1. The Light has become a wreath around my head, and I will not leave it, so the forces of Self-willed cannot take it from me.
2. Even if all things are shaken, I will not be shaken.
3. Even if all that is mine perishes and stays in the chaos, seen by the forces of Self-willed, I will not perish.
4. For the Light is with me, and I am with the Light.

"These were the words of Pistis Sophia. Now, if anyone understands the meaning of these words, let them come forward and explain."

Then Mary, the mother of Jesus, came forward and said: "My son in this world, my God and Savior from above, allow me to explain the meaning of the words that Pistis Sophia has spoken."And Jesus replied, "Mary, you have received a form from Barbelo, according to matter, and a likeness from the Virgin of Light, according to light. You and the other Mary, the blessed one, are the reason darkness has arisen. Moreover, from you came the material body I am in, which I have purified and refined. Now, I ask you to explain the words that Pistis Sophia has spoken."

Mary, the mother of Jesus, answered, "My Lord, your divine power has prophesied these words through Solomon in the nineteenth Ode:

'1. The Lord is on my head like a wreath, and I will not leave him.
2. The wreath is truly woven for me and has caused your branches to sprout in me.
3. It is not like a withered wreath that does not sprout. You are alive on my head and have sprouted upon me.
4. Your fruits are full and perfect, filled with your salvation.'"

When Jesus heard his mother Mary say these words, he said to her, "Well said, truly. Amen, amen, I tell you: They will call you blessed from one end of the earth to the other, for the pledge of the First Mystery resides with you, and through that pledge, everyone on earth and in the heavens will be saved. That pledge is the beginning and the end."

CHAPTER 60

Jesus continued speaking to his disciples, "When Pistis Sophia had completed her thirteenth repentance, the commandment of all the tribulations decreed for her fulfillment of the First Mystery, from the beginning, was accomplished. It was time to save her from the chaos and lead her out of all the darkness."Her repentance was accepted by the First Mystery, which sent me a great light-power from above to help Pistis Sophia and lead her out of chaos. I looked up towards the aeons and saw the light-power sent by the First Mystery to save Pistis Sophia from the chaos. When I saw it coming down to me from the aeons, another light-power went out from me to help her as well. The light-power from the First Mystery met with my light-power, and together they formed a great stream of light.

Jesus then asked his disciples if they understood his words. Mary responded, saying she understood. She explained that the light-power Jesus mentioned was prophesied in the eighty-fourth Psalm by David, where it says:

"Grace and truth met together, and righteousness and peace kissed each other. Truth sprouted forth from the earth, and righteousness looked down from heaven."

Mary explained that "Grace" is the light-power sent by the First Mystery, which had mercy on Pistis Sophia. "Truth" is the power from Jesus, fulfilling the truth to save her from chaos. "Righteousness" is the power from the First Mystery that will guide Pistis Sophia.And 'peace' is the power that came from you, so it could enter the emanations of Self-willed and retrieve the lights they took from Pistis Sophia. This way, you can gather them back into Pistis Sophia and bring harmony to her power. 'Truth,' on the other hand, is the power that came from you when you were in the lower regions of chaos. For this reason, your power spoke through David, saying, 'Truth sprouted from the earth,' because you were in the lower regions of chaos. 'Righteousness,' which 'looked down from heaven,' is the power that descended from above through the First Mystery and entered into Pistis Sophia.

CHAPTER 61

When Jesus heard these words, he said, "Well said, Mary, blessed one, who will inherit the whole Light-kingdom." Then Mary, the mother of Jesus, stepped forward and said, "My Lord and Savior, allow me to speak this word also." Jesus replied, "Anyone who has understanding, I do not hinder but encourage to speak their thoughts. Now, therefore, Mary, my mother in the physical world, you in whom I lived, I ask you to share your thoughts on this discourse." And Mary answered, "My Lord, concerning the prophecy your power spoke through David: 'Grace and truth met together, righteousness and peace kissed each other. Truth sprouted from the earth, and righteousness looked down from heaven,'—your power foretold this about you."When you were little, before the spirit had come upon you, while you were in a vineyard with Joseph, the spirit came to me in my house, looking just like you. I didn't recognize him and thought he was you. The spirit asked me, "Where is Jesus, my brother, so I can meet him?" I was confused and thought it was a trick, so I tied him to the foot of the bed in my house. Then, I went to find you and Joseph in the vineyard. I found you both there, with Joseph working. When you heard me speak to Joseph, you understood and were happy. You asked, "Where is he, so I can see him? Otherwise, I'll wait here." Joseph was surprised when he heard you, and we went back to the house together. We found the spirit still tied to the bed. We saw that he looked just like you. The spirit was untied, and he hugged and kissed you, and you kissed him back. You became one.

This is the meaning: 'Grace' is the spirit that came down from the highest place through the First Mystery. It had mercy on humanity and sent its spirit to forgive the sins of the whole world, so people could receive the mysteries and inherit the Light-kingdom. 'Truth' is the power that stayed with me. When it came from Barbelo, it became your physical body and spoke about the region of Truth. 'Righteousness' is your spirit, which brought the mysteries from the highest place to give them to humanity.**Modern English Conversion:**

---

**Chapter 62**

"Peace," on the other hand, is the power that has dwelled in your physical body according to the world. It has baptized humanity, making it free from sin and bringing it into harmony with your spirit. This helps them to be in harmony with the emanations of the Light, which means "Grace and truth have come together." As it is said, "Truth sprouted from the earth"—this 'truth' is your physical body, which came from me according to the world of men and has proclaimed the region of Truth. And again, as it is said, "Righteousness looked down from heaven"—this 'righteousness' is the power that looked down from above, giving the mysteries of the Light to humanity so that they may become righteous and good, and inherit the Light-kingdom.

When Jesus heard these words spoken by his mother Mary, he said, "Well said, very well, Mary."

Then, another Mary stepped forward and said, "My Lord, please be patient with me and do not be angry. Since your mother spoke to you about the meaning of these words, I felt compelled to come forward and also explain them." Jesus said to her, "I ask you to explain their meaning." Mary said, "My Lord, 'Grace and truth met together'—'grace' is the spirit that came upon you when you were baptized by John. 'Grace' is the divine spirit that came upon you; it had mercy on humanity, came down, and met with the power of Sabaoth, the Good within you, and proclaimed the regions of Truth. It is also said, 'Righteousness and peace kissed each other'—'righteousness' is the spirit of the Light, which came upon you and brought the mysteries of the heights."

---To give them to humanity. 'Peace,' on the other hand, is the power of Sabaoth, the Good, within you—he who has baptized and forgiven humanity—and has brought peace to the children of the Light. Furthermore, as your power has said through David: 'Truth sprouted from the earth,'—this refers to the power of Sabaoth, the Good, which sprouted from Mary, your mother, who lived on earth. 'Righteousness,' which 'looked down from heaven,' is the spirit from above that has brought all the mysteries of the heavens and given them to humanity; they have become righteous and good and inherited the Light-kingdom."

When Jesus heard Mary speak these words, he said: "Well said, Mary, inheritor of the Light." Mary, the mother of Jesus, again approached, fell at his feet, kissed them, and said: "My Lord, my son, and my Savior, do not be angry with me, but forgive me, so I may explain these words once more. 'Grace and truth met together,'—this refers to me, Mary, your mother, and Elizabeth, John's mother, whom I met. 'Grace' is the power of Sabaoth within me, which came forth from me, which is you. You have shown mercy to all of humanity. 'Truth,' on the other hand, is the power within Elizabeth, which is John, who came and proclaimed the way of Truth, which is you—who proclaimed before you. And again, 'Grace and truth met together,'—this is you, my Lord, who met John on the day you were baptized. And again, you and John are 'Righteousness and peace kissed each other.'—'Truth sprouted from the earth, and righteousness looked down from heaven,'—this refers to the time when you ministered to yourself, took on the form of Gabriel, looked down upon me from heaven, and spoke with me."When you spoke to me, the truth and the power of goodness grew within me, symbolizing the 'truth' that emerged from the earth. When Jesus heard his mother Mary say these words, he replied: "Well said. This explains all the prophecies my light-power foretold through the prophet David."

[THE NOTE OF A SCRIBE]

Here are the names I will provide from the Boundless onward. Write them with a sign, so the Sons of God may be revealed. The name of the Immortal is 'aaa, ooo'; the name of the Voice, which the Perfect Man activated, is 'iii.' The interpretations of these names are as follows:
- 'aaa' means 'fff'
- 'mmm' or 'ooo' means 'aaa'
- 'ps ps ps' means 'ooo'
- 'fff' means 'nnn'
- 'ddd' means 'aaa'
The one on the throne is 'aaa.' The interpretation of the second name is 'aaaa, aaaa, aaaa,' which is the full name's interpretation.

THE SECOND BOOK OF PISTIS SOPHIA

CHAPTER 63

John also stepped forward and said: "Lord, may I also explain the words your light-power prophesied through David?" Jesus replied: "Yes, John, you may explain the words my light-power prophesied through David:

'Grace and truth met together, and righteousness and peace kissed each other. Truth sprouted from the earth, and righteousness looked down from heaven.'"And John replied, "This is what you told us before: 'I have come from the Heights and entered into Sabaoth, the Good, and embraced the light-power within him.' Now, 'Grace and truth' which 'met together'--you are 'grace,' sent from the Heights by your Father, the First Mystery, who looks inward, to have mercy on the whole world. 'Truth,' on the other hand, is the power of Sabaoth, the Good, which you cast out to the Left--you, the First Mystery, looking outward. The little Sabaoth, the Good, took it and cast it into the matter of Barbelo, proclaiming the regions of Truth to those on the Left. This matter of Barbelo is your body today.

'Righteousness and peace' which 'kissed each other'--'righteousness' is you, bringing all the mysteries through your Father, the First Mystery, looking inward, and baptizing the power of Sabaoth, the Good; you went to the region of the rulers and gave them the mysteries of the Heights, making them righteous and good. 'Peace,' on the other hand, is the power of Sabaoth, your soul, which entered into the matter of Barbelo, and all the rulers of the six aeons of Yabraoth have made peace with the mystery of the Light.

'Truth' which 'sprouted forth out of the earth' is the power of Sabaoth, the Good, which came from the region of the Right, outside the Treasury of the Light, and entered into the region of the Left; it entered the matter of Barbelo and proclaimed the mysteries of the region of Truth.""Righteousness," which looked down from heaven, is the First Mystery that observes from above. You came from the heights with the mysteries of the Light Kingdom and descended upon the light-vesture you received from Barbelo. This vesture is Jesus, our Savior, upon whom you descended like a dove. When John spoke these words, the First Mystery that observes from above said to him, "Well said, John, beloved brother."

CHAPTER 64

The First Mystery continued saying, "It happened that the power from the Heights, sent by my Father to save Pistis Sophia from chaos, combined with my power and the soul I received from Sabaoth, the Good. They merged into a single stream of light that shone brightly. I summoned Gabriel and Michael from the aeons, as commanded by my Father, the First Mystery that observes from within, and gave them the light-stream. They went into the chaos to assist Pistis Sophia and retrieve the light-powers that the emanations of Self-willed had taken from her.

"As soon as they brought the light-stream into the chaos, it shone brilliantly throughout all the regions. The emanations of Self-willed were terrified when they saw the great light of the stream."The stream of light took back all the light-powers that had been taken from Pistis Sophia. The emanations of Self-willed could not capture this light-stream in the dark chaos, nor could they manipulate it. Gabriel and Michael guided the light-stream over Pistis Sophia’s body and restored all the light-powers to her. Her body became radiant, and all her powers, which had lost their light, regained it. This light was given to them through me. Michael and Gabriel, who brought the light-stream into the chaos, will also provide the mysteries of the Light. They did not take any light for themselves from Sophia’s lights that were taken from Self-willed’s emanations.

When the light-stream returned all the light-powers to Pistis Sophia, she became radiant again. The light-powers within her, which had not been taken by Self-willed’s emanations, became joyful and filled with light. The lights revived the parts of Pistis Sophia that were nearly perished and restored all her powers. They regained their light-power and returned to their former state, increasing in their sense of the Light. All the light-powers of Sophia recognized each other through my light-stream and were saved by its light.And my light stream, after reclaiming the lights taken by the emanations of Self-willed from Pistis Sophia, returned those lights to Pistis Sophia and then ascended out of the chaos. When the First Mystery explained this to the disciples regarding what had happened to Pistis Sophia in the chaos, he asked them: "Do you understand how I am explaining this to you?"

CHAPTER 65

Peter stepped forward and said: "My Lord, regarding the meaning of your words, your light-power had previously prophesied through Solomon in his Odes:

1. A stream emerged and became a vast flood.
2. It overpowered everything and turned against the temple.
3. Dams and buildings could not contain it, nor could those who controlled the waters.
4. It spread across the entire land and took hold of everything.
5. Those who were on dry sand drank; their thirst was satisfied when the Highest provided the drink.
6. Blessed are those entrusted with that drink, the water of the Lord.
7. They have refreshed parched lips; those who had lost their strength found joy and revived souls, preventing death.
8. They raised fallen limbs, gave strength, and light to their eyes.
9. They have recognized themselves in the Lord and are saved through the water of eternal life.

Listen, my Lord, and I will explain further. As your power prophesied through Solomon: 'A stream emerged and became a vast flood,'--this means: The light-stream has spread itself in the chaos across all regions of the emanations of Self-willed."And again, the word spoken through Solomon: 'It pulled everything to itself and brought it to the temple,'--meaning: It drew all the light-powers from the emanations of Self-willed, which they had taken from Pistis Sophia, and gave them back to her.

And again, the word spoken: 'The dams and buildings couldn't hold it,'--meaning: The emanations of Self-willed couldn't contain the light-stream within the darkness of chaos.

And again, the word spoken: 'It spread over the whole land and filled everything,'--meaning: When Gabriel and Michael led it over Pistis Sophia's body, they returned all the lights taken from her, making her body shine.

And the word spoken: 'Those in the dry sand drank,'--meaning: All within Pistis Sophia who had lost their light, regained it.

And the word spoken: 'Their thirst was quenched,'--meaning: Her powers no longer lacked light because the light taken from them was returned.

And again, as your power has spoken: 'The draught through the Highest was given to them,'--meaning: The light was given to them through the light-stream that came from you, the First Mystery.

And as your power has spoken: 'Blessed are the ministers of that draught,'--this means: Michael and Gabriel, who ministered, brought the light-stream into the chaos and led it out again. They will give the mysteries of the Light of the Height to those entrusted with the light-stream.

And again, as your power has spoken: 'They refreshed parched lips,'--meaning: Gabriel and Michael did not keep the lights of Pistis Sophia for themselves, which they took from the emanations of Self-willed, but returned them to Pistis Sophia.Here's a modern English version of the text:

---

And again, the word it spoke:

"Those whose power was taken away have found joy in their hearts." This means: All the other powers of Pistis Sophia, which the emanations of Self-willed have not taken, are now very happy and have filled themselves with light from their fellow beings, who have shared their light with them.

"And the word which your power spoke: 'They have revived souls by breathing into them, so they would not die.' This means: When they poured the lights into Pistis Sophia, they revived her material body, which had previously lost its lights and was about to perish.

"And again, the word your power spoke: 'They have raised up limbs that were fallen, or so they would not fall.' This means: When they poured her lights back into her, they restored all her powers that were on the verge of dissolving.

"And again, as your light-power has spoken: 'They have regained their light and are as they were before.' And again, the word it spoke: 'They have given light to their eyes.' This means: They have gained understanding in the Light and recognized the light-stream, knowing it belongs to the Height.

"And again, the word it spoke: 'They all have known themselves in the Lord.' This means: All the powers of Pistis Sophia have come to know each other through the light-stream.

"And again, the word it spoke: 'They are saved through the water of eternal Life.' This means: They are saved through the entire light-stream.

"And again, the word it spoke: 'The light-stream gathered everything to itself and enveloped the temple.' This means: When the light-stream took all the light-powers of Pistis Sophia and freed them from the emanations of Self-willed, it poured them into Pistis Sophia and then moved out of chaos to come over to you—you, who are the temple.Here is the simplified and modernized version of the text:

---

This is the meaning of all the words spoken by your light-power through the Ode of Solomon. When the First Mystery heard Peter say this, he replied, "Well said, blessed Peter. This is the meaning of the words spoken."

Chapter 66

The First Mystery continued, "Before I rescued Pistis Sophia from chaos, as I had not yet been commanded by my Father, the First Mystery who sees within, the emanations of Self-willed noticed that my light had taken back the light-powers they had stolen from Pistis Sophia and returned them to her. When they saw that Pistis Sophia shone as before, they became angry and called out to Self-willed for help to take away her powers again.

"Self-willed sent another great light-power from the thirteenth aeon down into the chaos like a flying arrow to assist his emanations in taking the lights from Pistis Sophia once more. When that light-power arrived, the emanations of Self-willed in chaos took courage and pursued Pistis Sophia with great terror and alarm. Some of the emanations oppressed her, one transforming into a great serpent, another into a seven-headed basilisk, and another into a dragon."

---

This version retains the original meaning while using simpler and more modern language.The first power of Self-willed, the lion-faced being, and all his numerous followers came together and oppressed Pistis Sophia, driving her back into the lower regions of chaos and frightening her greatly. Then Adamas, the Tyrant, who ruled over the twelve aeons, grew angry with Pistis Sophia because she wished to go to the Light of lights, which was above them all.

When Adamas saw that Self-willed's followers were oppressing Pistis Sophia to strip her of all her lights, he descended into chaos to join them. The demon Adamas attacked Pistis Sophia, and the lion-faced power, along with serpent, basilisk, dragon, and many other forms of Self-willed's emanations, surrounded her. They sought to take away her powers and oppressed her greatly, threatening her.

In her distress, Pistis Sophia cried out to the Light and sang praises, saying:

"1. O Light, you have helped me; let your light come over me.

2. For you are my protector, and I come to you with faith, O Light.

3. For you are my savior from the emanations of Self-willed and Adamas, the Tyrant, and you will save me from all his violent threats."

When Pistis Sophia said this, my Father, the First Mystery who looks within, commanded me to send Gabriel, Michael, and the great light-stream to help her.I commanded Gabriel and Michael to carry Pistis Sophia so her feet wouldn't touch the dark regions below. I also instructed them to guide her through the chaotic areas she needed to leave. 

When the angels and the light-stream entered the chaos, all the beings of Self-willed and Adamas saw the exceptionally bright light and were terrified. They left Pistis Sophia, and the great light-stream surrounded her completely, forming a wreath of light around her head.

With the light-stream surrounding her, Pistis Sophia gained courage and was no longer afraid of the beings of Self-willed or the new power of Self-willed that was cast into the chaos like a flying arrow. She also no longer trembled at the demon power of Adamas from the aeons.

By my command, as the First Mystery, the light-stream shone even brighter around her, and Pistis Sophia remained in the midst of the light. The light formed a wreath around her head, and the beings of Self-willed could not change their appearance or withstand the intense light of the stream surrounding her.And all the emanations of Self-willed—many of them fell to her right because she shone so brightly, and many others fell to her left, unable to get close to Pistis Sophia due to her great light. They all fell on each other or gathered near one another, but they could not harm Pistis Sophia because she trusted in the Light. 

"Following the command of my Father, the First Mystery who looks within, I went down into chaos, shining very brightly. I approached the lion-faced power, which also shone brightly, and took its entire light within me. I restrained all the emanations of Self-willed so they could no longer return to their region, the thirteenth aeon. I took away the power of all Self-willed's emanations, rendering them powerless in the chaos. I then led Pistis Sophia out, placing her to the right of Gabriel and Michael. The great light-stream re-entered her, and she saw her enemies who had lost their light-power.

I guided Pistis Sophia out of chaos; she trampled the serpent-faced emanation of Self-willed, the seven-faced basilisk emanation, and the lion- and dragon-faced power. I made her stand on the seven-headed basilisk emanation of Self-willed, which was the most evil of all. I, the First Mystery, stood by it, took all its powers, and destroyed its entire substance so that no seed would arise from it ever again."

When the First Mystery said this to his disciples, he asked them, "Do you understand how I am speaking to you?"James stepped forward and said, "My Lord, regarding the meaning of your words, your light-power has already foretold this through David in the 91st Psalm:

"'1. Whoever lives under the protection of the Most High will stay in the shadow of the God of heaven.
"'2. He will say to the Lord: You are my support and my refuge, my God, in whom I trust.
"'3. For He will save me from the trap of the hunters and from powerful words.
"'4. He will cover you with His feathers, and you will find trust under His wings; His truth will be your shield.

"'5. You will not fear the terror of the night nor the arrow that flies by day,
"'6. Nor the things that lurk in the darkness, nor the disaster or demon at noon.
"'7. A thousand will fall at your left, and ten thousand at your right hand, but they will not come near you.
"'8. You will see with your eyes the punishment of the wicked.
"'9. For you, Lord, are my hope. You have made the Most High your refuge.
"'10. No harm will come near you; no plague will come near your home.
"'11. For He will command His angels to guard you in all your ways,
"'12. They will lift you up in their hands, so you will not strike your foot against a stone.
"'13. You will step on the serpent and the basilisk and trample the lion and the dragon.
"'14. Because he trusts in me, I will save him; I will protect him because he knows my name.
"'15. He will call to me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble and will deliver him and honor him,
"'16. I will give him a long life and show him my salvation.'

"This, my Lord, is the interpretation of your words. Listen, so I may speak openly."The word spoken by your power through David: "Whoever dwells under the protection of the Most High will stay in the shadow of the God of heaven," means: When Sophia trusted in the Light, she remained under the light that came from you from on high.

And the word spoken by your power through David: "I will say to the Lord: You are my help and my refuge, my God, in whom I trust," is the same praise that Pistis Sophia sang: "You are my help, and I come to you."

And the word spoken by your power: "My God, in whom I trust, you will save me from the snare of the hunters and from mighty words," reflects what Pistis Sophia said: "O Light, I have faith in you, for you will save me from the emanations of Self-willed and Adamas, the Tyrant, and from all their powerful threats."

And the word spoken through David: "He will cover you with his feathers, and you will find refuge under his wings," means: Pistis Sophia was in the light that came from you, and she firmly trusted in the light on her left and right, which are the wings of the light.

And the word prophesied through David: "Truth will surround you as a shield," means the light surrounded Pistis Sophia like a shield.

And the word spoken: "He will not be afraid of terror by night," means Pistis Sophia was not afraid of the terrors and alarms in the chaos, which is the "night."He will not be afraid of an arrow that flies by day. This means that Pistis Sophia is not scared of the power sent by Self-willed from above, which entered the chaos like a flying arrow. Your light-power has said, "You will not be afraid of an arrow that flies by day," because that power comes from the thirteenth aeon, which rules over the twelve aeons and gives light to them all. This is why "day" is mentioned.

And again, the phrase "He will not be afraid of something that lurks in the darkness" means that Sophia is not afraid of the lion-faced emanation that caused fear for Pistis Sophia in the chaos, referred to as "darkness."

Moreover, the phrase "He will not be afraid of a misfortune or a demon at midday" means that Pistis Sophia is not afraid of the demon emanation of Tyrant Adamas, which caused great misfortune for Pistis Sophia and came from Adamas in the twelfth aeon. This is why your light-power said, "He will not be afraid of the demon misfortune at midday"—"midday" because it comes from the twelve aeons, which is "midday"; and "night" because it comes from the chaos, which is "night," and from the twelfth aeon that lies between both. Therefore, your light-power said "midday" because the twelve aeons lie between the thirteenth aeon and the chaos.Here is a simplified and modernized version of the text:

"And again, the word spoken by your light-power through David: 'A thousand will fall on his left, and ten thousand on his right hand, but they will not come near him.' This means that when the numerous emanations of Self-willed couldn’t handle the great light of the light-stream, many fell on the left side of Pistis Sophia and many on her right, but none could come close enough to harm her.

And the word spoken by your light-power through David: 'With your eyes, you will see the punishment of the sinners, for you, O Lord, are my hope.' This means that Pistis Sophia saw her enemies, the emanations of Self-willed, fall upon each other. Not only did she witness this, but you, my Lord, the First Mystery, also took the light-power from the lion-faced power and the power of all the emanations of Self-willed. You imprisoned them in chaos, preventing them from returning to their own region. Therefore, Pistis Sophia saw her enemies, the emanations of Self-willed, just as David prophesied: 'With your eyes, you will see the punishment of the sinners.' She saw them fall upon each other in chaos and witnessed their punishment. Just as the emanations of Self-willed tried to take Sophia's light, you repaid them by taking their light-power, in place of the light of Sophia, who had faith in the Light of the Height."And as your light-power spoke through David: 'You have made the Most High your refuge; no harm will come near you, no scourge will come near your dwelling,'—that means: When Pistis Sophia had faith in the Light and was troubled, she praised it, and the forces of Self-willed could not harm her or come near her.

And the word your light-power spoke through David: 'He will command his angels to guard you in all your ways and carry you so you do not strike your foot against a stone,'—again, this is your word: You commanded Gabriel and Michael to guide Pistis Sophia through the chaos until they led her out, lifting her so her feet did not touch the darkness below, preventing those from the lower darkness from seizing her.

And the word your light-power spoke through David: 'You will tread on serpent and basilisk, and on lion and dragon; because he trusted in me, I will save him and protect him, because he knows my name,'—this means: When Pistis Sophia was about to leave the chaos, she stepped on the forces of Self-willed, and on the serpent-faced and basilisk-faced ones with seven heads, and on the lion-faced and dragon-faced powers. Because she had faith in the Light, she was saved from all of them.

This, my Lord, is the meaning of the words you have spoken.

CHAPTER 68

When the First Mystery heard these words, he said: "Well said, James, beloved one."The First Mystery continued speaking to the disciples and said:

"When I had led Pistis Sophia out of the chaos, she cried out and said:

'1. I am saved from the chaos and freed from the darkness. I have come to you, O Light. 
2. You were light all around me, saving and helping me. 
3. The forces of Self-willed that fought against me were stopped by your light, and they could not reach me because your light was with me and saved me through its stream. 
4. The forces of Self-willed had taken away my power and cast me into the chaos without light, making me feel heavy compared to them. 
5. Then a stream of light came to me through you and saved me, surrounding me on all sides so that no part of me was without light. 
6. You covered me with the light of your stream, purging all my evil matters, and I will be relieved of all my burdens because of your light. 
7. Your light-stream raised me up and removed the forces of Self-willed that constrained me. 
8. I have become confident in your light, purified by your stream. 
9. The forces of Self-willed have withdrawn from me, and I shone with your great power, for you save forever.'

This is the repentance that Pistis Sophia expressed when she came out of the chaos and was freed from its bonds. Therefore, anyone who has ears to hear, let them hear."

Pistis Sophia, by G.R.S.**Chapter 69**

When the First Mystery finished speaking to his disciples, Thomas stepped forward and said, "My Lord, my inner light has heard and my mind has understood your words. Now, please give me permission to clearly explain their meaning." The First Mystery replied to Thomas, "I give you permission to explain the song that Pistis Sophia sang to me."

Thomas said, "My Lord, regarding the song that Pistis Sophia sang because she was saved from chaos, your light-power foretold it through Solomon, the son of David, in his Odes:

"'1. I am saved from the bonds and have fled to you, O Lord.
"'2. For you have been at my right hand, saving and helping me.
"'3. You have hindered my enemies, and they have not been revealed because your presence was with me, saving me by your grace.
"'4. I was despised and cast out by many; I became like lead in their eyes.
"'5. Through you, I gained a power that helped me; you set lamps on my right and left, so I am surrounded by light.
"'6. You overshadowed me with your grace, and I was relieved of my burdens.
"'7. Your right hand raised me up, and you took sickness from me.
"'8. I became powerful in your truth and purified by your righteousness.
"'9. My enemies withdrew from me, and I am justified by your goodness, for your rest endures forever.'

"My Lord, this is the meaning of the repentance that Pistis Sophia expressed when she was saved from chaos. Listen, so I may explain it clearly."The words spoken by your light-power through Solomon: "I am saved from the bonds and have fled to you, O Lord," are the same as what Pistis Sophia said: "I am freed from the darkness and have come to you, O Light."

The words spoken by your power: "You were on my right hand, saving and helping me," are the same as what Pistis Sophia said: "You have become a light all around me, saving and helping me."

The words spoken by your light-power: "You have hindered my adversaries and they have not been revealed," are the same as what Pistis Sophia said: "The emanations of Self-willed that fought against me were hindered by your light, and they could not approach me."

The words spoken by your power: "Your face was with me, saving me in your grace," are the same as what Pistis Sophia said: "Your light was with me, saving me through your light-stream."

The words spoken by your power: "I was despised and cast out in the sight of many," are the same as what Pistis Sophia said: "The emanations of Self-willed constrained me and took my power, and I was despised and cast into chaos, with no light in me."

The words spoken by your power: "I became like lead in their sight," are the same as what Pistis Sophia said: "When they took my light, I became like heavy matter to them."

The words spoken by your power: "Through you, I gained a power that helped me," are the same as what Pistis Sophia said: "A light-power came to me through you, saving me.""And the word spoken by your power: 'You have set lamps on my right and on my left, so that no side of me is without light,'--this is the word that Pistis Sophia spoke:

'Your power shone on my right and left and surrounded me completely, so that no part of me was without light.'"

"And the word spoken by your power: 'You have overshadowed me with the shadow of your grace,'--this is also the word that Pistis Sophia spoke: 'You have covered me with the light of the stream.'"

"And the word spoken by your power: 'I was freed from the coats of skin,'--this is also the word that Pistis Sophia spoke: 'They purified me of all my evil, and I rose above them in your light.'"

"And the word spoken by your power through Solomon: 'Your right hand raised me up and took away my sickness,'--this is the word that Pistis Sophia spoke: 'Your light-stream raised me up and took away the emanations of Self-willed that constrained me.'"

"And the word spoken by your power: 'I have become powerful in your truth and purified in your righteousness,'--this is the word that Pistis Sophia spoke: 'I have become powerful in your light and purified in your stream.'"

"And the word spoken by your power: 'My adversaries have withdrawn from me,'--this is the word that Pistis Sophia spoke: 'The emanations of Self-willed that constrained me have withdrawn from me.'"

"And the word spoken by your power through Solomon: 'I am justified in your goodness, for your rest endures forever,'--this is the word that Pistis Sophia spoke: 'I am saved in your goodness, for you save everyone.'"Here is the text converted into modern English, corrected, and simplified without altering its original meaning:

---

This, my Lord, is the complete explanation of the repentance that Pistis Sophia expressed when she was saved from chaos and freed from the bonds of darkness.

---

**Chapter 70**

When the First Mystery heard Thomas say these words, he replied, "Well said, Thomas, blessed one. This is the explanation of the song that Pistis Sophia sang." The First Mystery continued, speaking to the disciples: "Pistis Sophia continued to praise me, saying:

1. "I sing a song to you. By your command, you led me down from the higher aeon above and brought me to the regions below.
2. "By your command, you saved me from the regions below. Through you, I have seen the matter in my light-powers.
3. "You scattered away the emanations of Self-willed that constrained and opposed me, giving me the power to free myself from the bonds of Adamas' emanations.
4. "You struck down the basilisk with seven heads, cast it out through my hands, and set me above its matter. You destroyed it so its seed cannot rise again.
5. "You were with me, giving me power in all of this, and your light surrounded me in all regions. Through you, you made all the emanations of Self-willed powerless.
6. "You took the power of their light from them and made my path straight to lead me out of chaos.
7. "You removed me from material darkness and took back all my powers from which the light had been taken.
8. "You put purified light into them and into all my limbs, which had no light. You gave purified light from the Light of the Height.
---

This version maintains the original meaning but uses simpler, more modern language.And you have made the path straight for my limbs, and the light of your face has given me everlasting life.

You have raised me above the chaos, the region of disorder and destruction, so that everything there could be released, and all my strengths could be renewed in your light, and your light would be in all of them.

You have placed the light of your stream in me, and I have become purified light.

This is the second song that Pistis Sophia has sung. Whoever understands this repentance, let them come forward and explain it.

CHAPTER 71

After the First Mystery finished speaking, Matthew stepped forward and said, "I understand the meaning of the song that Pistis Sophia has sung. Please give me permission to explain it openly." 

The First Mystery replied, "I give you permission, Matthew, to explain the meaning of the song that Pistis Sophia has sung."

Matthew said, "Regarding the interpretation of the song that Pistis Sophia has sung, your light-power prophesied about it previously in the Ode of Solomon:

1. He who led me down from the higher regions above has brought me up from the lower regions below.
2. He who took those in the middle has taught me about them.
3. He who scattered my enemies and adversaries has given me the power to break their bonds.
4. He who struck the seven-headed serpent with my hands has set me above its root so that I can destroy its seed.
5. And you were with me, helping me; your name surrounded me in all regions.
6. Your right hand has destroyed the venom of the slanderer; your hand has cleared the way for your faithful."You have freed them from the tombs and removed them from among the corpses. You have taken dead bones and given them bodies, and to those who were lifeless, you have given the activity of life. Your path has become indestructible, and so has your presence. You have led your era above decay, so that they all may be released and renewed, and your light has become a foundation for them all. You have bestowed your riches upon them, and they have become a holy dwelling place.

This, my Lord, is the interpretation of the song which Pistis Sophia has sung. Listen, so I may explain it clearly. The word your power spoke through Solomon: 'Who has led me down from the higher regions above and also brought me up from the lower regions below,' is the same word Pistis Sophia spoke: 'I sing praises to you; by your command, you led me down from the higher realm above and brought me to the regions below. And again, by your command, you saved me and brought me up from the lower regions.' 

And the word your power spoke through Solomon: 'Who has taken those in the middle and taught me about them,' is the same word Pistis Sophia spoke: 'By your command, you purified the matter within my power, and I have seen it.' 

Moreover, the word your power spoke through Solomon: 'Who has scattered my foes and adversaries,' is the same word Pistis Sophia spoke: 'You have scattered far from me all the emanations of Self-willed that constrained and opposed me.' 

And the word your power spoke: 'Who has granted me wisdom over the bonds, to unbind them,' is the same word Pistis Sophia spoke: 'And he has granted me wisdom to free myself from the bonds of those emanations.'The text you provided has been converted into modern English and simplified for clarity:

"And the word your power has spoken: 'Who has struck the serpent with seven heads with my hands, has set me above its root to extinguish its seed,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia has spoken: 'You have struck the serpent with seven heads through my hands and set me above its matter. You have destroyed it so its seed cannot rise again.'

"And the word your power has spoken: 'And you were with me, helping me,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia has spoken: 'And you were with me, giving me power in all of this.'

"And the word your power has spoken: 'And your name surrounded me in all regions,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia has spoken: 'And your light surrounded me in all their regions.'

"And the word your power has spoken: 'And your right hand has destroyed the venom of the slanderers,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia has spoken: 'And through you the emanations of Self-willed became powerless because you took their light of power.'

"And the word your power has spoken: 'Your hand has cleared the way for your faithful,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia has spoken: 'You made my way straight to lead me out of the chaos because I had faith in you.'

"And the word your power has spoken: 'You have freed them from the tombs and removed them from among the corpses,'--it is the word which Pistis Sophia has spoken: 'You have freed me from the chaos and removed me from the material darkness, that is, from the dark emanations in the chaos, from which you took their light.'"Sure, here is the text converted into modern English:

"And the word spoken by your power: 'You have taken dead bones and clothed them with a body, and given life to those who were inactive,'—this is the word that Pistis Sophia spoke: 'You have taken all my powers that had no light and bestowed purified light on them, and given life-light to all my limbs that had no light.'

"And the word spoken by your power: 'Your way has become indestructible, and your face too,'—this is the word that Pistis Sophia spoke: 'You have straightened your way for me, and the light of your face has become my indestructible life.'

"And the word spoken by your power: 'You have led your aeon above decay, so that all might be freed and renewed,'—this is the word that Pistis Sophia spoke: 'You have led me, your power, above chaos and decay, so that everything in that region may be freed, and all my powers renewed in the Light.'

"And the word spoken by your power: 'And your light has become the foundation for them all,'—this is the word that Pistis Sophia spoke: 'And your light has been in them all.'

"And the word spoken by your light-power through Solomon: 'You have placed your riches over him, and he has become a holy dwelling-place,'—this is the word that Pistis Sophia spoke: 'You have stayed the light of your stream over me, and I have become a purified light.'

"This then, my Lord, is the meaning of the song that Pistis Sophia has sung."

CHAPTER 72

It happened that when the First Mystery heard Matthew speak these words, he said: "Well said, Matthew, and beautifully done, beloved. This is the meaning of the song that Pistis Sophia has sung." And the First Mystery continued and said:

"1.I will declare: You are the higher Light, for you have saved me and led me to you, and you have not let the emanations of the Self-willed, which are hostile to me, take my light.

"O Light of lights, I sing praises to you; you have saved me.
O Light, you have led my power out of chaos; you have saved me from those who have fallen into darkness."

Pistis Sophia has spoken these words. Now, those who understand what she has said, let them come forward and explain their meaning.

When the First Mystery finished speaking to the disciples, Mary stepped forward and said: "My Lord, my mind is always ready to understand and explain the words she has spoken, but I am afraid of Peter because he threatened me and hates women."

The First Mystery replied: "Anyone filled with the spirit of light may come forward and explain what I say; no one can stop them. So, Mary, go ahead and explain the words of Pistis Sophia."

Mary then spoke to the First Mystery among the disciples: "My Lord, regarding the explanation of the words of Pistis Sophia, your light-power previously prophesied through David:

'I will exalt you, O Lord, for you have lifted me up, and you have not let my enemies rejoice over me.
O Lord, my God, I cried to you, and you healed me.
O Lord, you have brought my soul up from the grave; you have saved me from those who go down into the pit.'"

Pistis Sophia, by G.R.S. Mead, [1921], at sacred-texts.com

CHAPTER 73

After Mary said this, the First Mystery replied, "Well said, Mary, blessed one." And he continued...The First Mystery continued speaking to the disciples and said:

"Sophia continued singing and said:

'1. The Light has become my savior.
'2. It has turned my darkness into light, and it has broken the chaos around me and surrounded me with light.'"

After the First Mystery finished these words, Martha stepped forward and said: "My Lord, your power has previously prophesied through David about these words:

'10. The Lord has become my helper.
'11. He has turned my sorrow into joy; he has torn apart my mourning clothes and surrounded me with joy.'"

When the First Mystery heard Martha speak, he said: "Well said, Martha."

The First Mystery continued and said to the disciples: "Pistis Sophia continued in the song and said:

'1. My power, sing praises to the Light and do not forget all the powers the Light has given you.
'2. And the powers within you, sing praises to the name of his holy mystery;
'3. Who forgives all your transgressions, who saves you from the afflictions caused by the emanations of Self-willed;
'4. Who saved your light from the destructive emanations of Self-willed; who surrounded you with light in his compassion, until he saved you;
'5. Who filled you with purified light; and your beginning will renew itself as an invisible of the Height.'

With these words, Pistis Sophia sang praises, remembering all the things I had done for her."

After the First Mystery finished explaining these words to the disciples, he said: "Whoever understands the meaning of these words, come forward and explain it openly."Mary stepped forward again and said, "My Lord, regarding the words with which Pistis Sophia praised you, your light-power prophesied through David:

"'1. My soul, praise the Lord; let everything within me praise his holy name.
"'2. My soul, praise the Lord and don't forget all his rewards.
"'3. He forgives all your sins and heals all your illnesses;
"'4. He saves your life from decay and crowns you with grace and compassion;
"'5. He fulfills your desires with good things; your youth is renewed like an eagle's.'

This means: Sophia will be like the invisible beings in the Height. He mentioned 'like an eagle' because an eagle's home is high up, just like the invisibles are in the Height. This signifies that Pistis Sophia will shine like the invisibles, as she did from the beginning."

When the First Mystery heard Mary say these words, he replied, "Well said, Mary, blessed one." Then, the First Mystery continued speaking to the disciples, "I took Pistis Sophia and led her to a region below the thirteenth aeon, and gave her a new Light mystery, different from that of her aeon, the region of the invisibles. Additionally, I gave her a song of the Light, so that from now on, the rulers of the aeons would not be able to overpower her. I placed her in that region until I could come and bring her to her higher region."

When I had moved her to that region, she sang this song:

"'1. I have had faith in the Light, and it remembered me and listened to my song.
"'2. It led my power up out of the chaos and the lower darkness of all matter and lifted me up. It has moved me to a higher and more secure aeon, lofty and firm; it has changed my path towards my region.'"And it has given me a new mystery, not of my age, and a song of the Light. Now, O Light, all the rulers will see what you have done for me, and be afraid and believe in the Light.' This song was then sung by Pistis Sophia, rejoicing that she had been brought up out of chaos and into regions below the thirteenth aeon. Therefore, anyone who understands the meaning of the song that Pistis Sophia has sung, step forward and explain it."

Andrew stepped forward and said: "My Lord, this relates to what your light-power previously prophesied through David:

"'1. I waited patiently for the Lord; he listened to me and heard my cry. "'2. He brought my soul out of the pit of misery and the filthy mire; he set my feet on a rock and made my steps secure. "'3. He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God. Many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord.'"

When Andrew explained Pistis Sophia's thought, the First Mystery said to him: "Well said, Andrew, blessed one."

CHAPTER 75

He continued speaking to the disciples: "These are the events that happened to Pistis Sophia. When I had led her to the region below the thirteenth aeon, and was about to go to the Light and leave her, she said to me:

"'O Light of lights, you are going to the Light and leaving me. Tyrant Adamas will know that you have left me and will know that my savior is not near.'"And he will return to this region, bringing all his rulers who despise me, and Self-willed will grant power to his lion-faced emanation. They will all come together to overpower me and take all my light, leaving me weak and without light again. Therefore, O Light, take away their power so they cannot overpower me anymore.

When I heard these words from Pistis Sophia, I replied: "My Father, who sent me, has not yet commanded me to take their light away. But I will seal the regions of Self-willed and his rulers who hate you because you believed in the Light. I will also seal the regions of Adamas and his rulers so that none of them can fight you until their time is up and my Father commands me to take their light."

CHAPTER 76

Then I said to her again: "Listen while I tell you about their time, when what I have said will happen. It will occur when the three times are completed." Pistis Sophia asked me: "O Light, how will I know when the three times will happen, so I can rejoice that the time is near for you to bring me to my region, and also rejoice that the time has come for you to take the light-power from those who hate me because I believed in your light?" I replied: "If you see the gate of the Treasury of the Great Light open after the thirteenth aeon, and it is the left gate—when that gate is open, then the three times are completed."Pistis Sophia responded, "O Light, how will I know that the gate is open, since I am in this region?"

I replied, "When the gate is open, everyone in the aeons will know because a Great Light will shine throughout their regions. Don't worry, I have ensured that no harm will come to you until the three times are completed. You will have the power to move through the twelve aeons whenever you wish and return to your current region, which is below the thirteenth aeon. However, you won't be able to pass through the gate in the thirteenth aeon to return to your original region.

Once the three times are completed, Self-Willed and his rulers will try to take your light, believing you have imprisoned his power in chaos and taken its light. He will be angry and will try to take your light to send it back into chaos, so his emanation can rise from it. Adamas will attempt this. But I will remove all your powers from him and return them to you. If they try to constrain you, sing praises to the Light, and I will come quickly to help you. I will come to their regions to take their light and then return to the region where I placed you, below the thirteenth aeon, until I bring you back to your original region."

When Pistis Sophia heard this, she rejoiced greatly.I moved her to the area below the thirteenth aeon. I went to the Light and left her there." The First Mystery shared these events with the disciples, explaining that they would happen to Pistis Sophia. He sat on the Mount of Olives, recounting these stories to his disciples. He continued, saying: "While I was still in the world among men, sitting here on the Mount of Olives, before my garment was sent to me, which I had placed in the twenty-fourth mystery from the inside but the first from the outside, the Great Uncontainable, which I wear, and before I went to the Height to receive my second garment--

[p. 143]

while I was with you here on the Mount of Olives, the time came that I had told Pistis Sophia about: 'Adamas and all his rulers will constrain you.'"

CHAPTER 77

"When that time arrived, I was among men, sitting with you on the Mount of Olives, and Adamas looked down from the twelve aeons into the regions of chaos. He saw his demon power in chaos, which had no light because I had taken it. Seeing it was dark and unable to return to his region, the twelve moons, Adamas became extremely angry at Pistis Sophia. He believed she had imprisoned his power in chaos and taken its light. Enraged, he sent out dark, chaotic, and evil forces to torment Pistis Sophia. He created a dark region to trap her."And he took many of his rulers; they chased after Sophia to lead her into the dark chaos made by Adamas. They intended to trap her there and torment her until they could take all her light. Adamas wanted to extract the light from Pistis Sophia and give it to the two dark emanations, who would then take it to the great dark chaos and throw it into his chaotic power, hoping it would reach his region, because it had become very dark after I took its light-power. 

When they pursued Pistis Sophia, she cried out and praised the Light, for I had told her, "If you are trapped and sing praises to me, I will come quickly to help you." When she was trapped—and I was with you on the Mount of Olives—she sang praises to the Light:

1. "O Light of lights, I have faith in you. Save me from these rulers who chase me, and help me,

2. So they may never take my light, as the lion-faced power did. Your light is not with me, and your light-stream is not here to save me. Adamas is even more enraged against me, saying: 'You have imprisoned my power in the chaos.'

3. Now, O Light of lights, if I have done this and imprisoned it, if I have done any injustice to that power,

4. Or if I have trapped it as it trapped me, then let all these rulers who chase me take my light and leave me empty;

5. And let Adamas pursue my power, seize it, take my light, cast it into his dark power in the chaos, and keep my power in the chaos."Now, therefore, O Light, grab hold of me in your anger and raise your power above my enemies who have risen against me to the very end.

"'7. Revive me quickly, as you have promised: I will help you.' Pistis Sophia, by G.R.S. Mead, [1921], at sacred-texts.com

CHAPTER 78

After the First Mystery finished speaking to the disciples, he said: "Whoever understands the words I have spoken, come forward and explain them." James stepped forward and said: "My Lord, regarding this song that Pistis Sophia has sung, your light-power has previously prophesied through David in the seventh Psalm:

"'1. O Lord, my God, I have placed my hope in you. Free me from my pursuers and save me,

"'2. So that they may never steal my soul like a lion, with no one to deliver and save me.

"'3. O Lord, my God, if I have done wrong, if there is injustice in my actions,

"'4. If I have repaid those who harmed me with evil, then let me fall empty before my enemies.

"'5. Let my enemy chase my soul, capture it, trample my life into the ground, and lay my honor in the dust. (Selah.)

"'6. Arise, O Lord, in your anger, rise up against the end of my enemies.

"'7. Arise according to the command you have given.'"

When the First Mystery heard James speak these words, he said: "Well said, beloved James." Pistis Sophia, by G.R.S. Mead, [1921], at sacred-texts.com

CHAPTER 79

The First Mystery continued and said to the disciples: "After Pistis Sophia finished singing, she turned to see if Adamas and his rulers had returned to their realm. She saw them still chasing her. Then she turned to them and said:

"'1. Why do you pursue me and say that I should not have help, that the Light should not save me from you?2. Now, therefore, my defender is the Light and it is powerful; but it is patient until the time it has promised to come and help me. It will not always be angry with you. But now is the time it spoke of. 

3. So, if you don't stop chasing me, the Light will prepare its power and get ready in all its might. 

4. It has prepared its power to take the light within you, making you dark, and it will take your power away, causing you to fall.

When Pistis Sophia said this, she looked at the region of Adamas and saw the dark and chaotic area he had created. She also saw the two dark, violent forces Adamas had sent to capture her and throw her into the chaos, to torment her and take her light. Seeing this, Pistis Sophia was afraid and cried out to the Light:

1. O Light, look! Adamas, the violent one, is angry; he has created a dark force.

2. He has also created another chaos and readied another dark and chaotic force.

3. So, O Light, the chaos he has made to trap me and take my light-power, take his power instead.

4. The plan he made to take my light should be turned against him; and the injustice he intended for me should befall him.

These are the words that Pistis Sophia spoke in her song.Now, therefore, anyone who is clear-minded, come forward and explain the meaning of the words that Pistis Sophia has sung."

### CHAPTER 80

Martha came forward and said, "My Lord, I am clear-minded and understand your words. Therefore, give me permission to explain their meaning openly." The First Mystery replied to Martha, "I give you permission, Martha, to explain the meaning of the words that Pistis Sophia has sung." Martha then said, "My Lord, these are the words that your light-power prophesied long ago through David in the seventh Psalm:

"'12. God is a righteous avenger, strong and patient, not bringing his wrath every day.

"'13. If you do not repent, he will sharpen his sword; he has bent his bow and made it ready.

"'14. He has prepared deadly weapons; he has made his arrows for those who will be destroyed.

"'15. Look, injustice has labored, conceived wrong, and given birth to iniquity.

"'16. It has dug a pit and hollowed it out. It will fall into the hole it has made.

"'17. Its wrong will return on its own head, and its injustice will come down on its own skull.'"

After Martha said this, the First Mystery who looks outside said to her, "Well said, nicely done, Martha, blessed one."

### CHAPTER 81

When Jesus had finished telling his disciples all the ordeals that Pistis Sophia had faced in the chaos, and the wayShe had sung praises to the Light, asking it to save her, lead her out of chaos, and guide her into the twelve aeons. She also praised how it had saved her from all the troubles caused by the rulers of chaos, as she longed to reach the Light. Jesus continued speaking to his disciples, saying: "After all this, I took Pistis Sophia and led her into the thirteenth aeon, where I shone exceedingly bright, with light beyond measure. I entered the region of the twenty-four invisibles, shining brilliantly. They were greatly disturbed; they saw Sophia with me. They recognized her but did not know who I was, thinking I was an emanation from the Light-land.

"When Pistis Sophia saw her fellow invisibles, she rejoiced greatly and wanted to share the wonders I had performed for her on earth, saving her. She went into their midst and sang praises to me, saying:

"'1. I thank you, O Light, for you are a savior; you are a deliverer for all time. 
"'2. I will sing this song to the Light, for it has saved me from the hands of my enemies. 
"'3. You have preserved me in all regions, saving me from the height and the depth of chaos and from the aeons of the rulers of the sphere. 
"'4. When I left the Height, I wandered in regions without light and could not return to the thirteenth aeon, my home. 
"'5. I had no light or power; my strength was utterly weakened. 
"'6. The Light saved me in all my troubles. I sang praises to the Light, and it listened to me when I was in distress.'"It guided me in creating the aeons to lead me up into the thirteenth aeon, my dwelling place.

8. I will thank you, O Light, for saving me and for your wonderful works for humanity.

9. When I lost my power, you gave me strength; and when I lost my light, you filled me with pure light.

10. I was in darkness and the shadow of chaos, bound by the strong chains of chaos, and had no light in me.

11. I disobeyed the command of the Light and did wrong, making the Light's command angry because I left my place.

12. When I went down, I lost my light and became without light, and no one helped me.

13. In my suffering, I sang praises to the Light, and it saved me from my troubles.

14. It broke all my bonds and led me out of the darkness and chaos.

15. I will thank you, O Light, for saving me and for your wonderful works among humans.

16. You shattered the upper gates of darkness and the strong bolts of chaos.

17. You let me leave the place where I had done wrong, and my light was taken because I had transgressed.

18. I stopped my mysteries and went down to the gates of chaos.

19. When I was in distress, I sang praises to the Light. It saved me from all my troubles.

20. You sent your stream; it gave me strength and saved me from all my afflictions.

21. I will thank you, O Light, for saving me and for your wonderful works among humans.This is the song that Pistis Sophia sang among the twenty-four invisibles, wanting them to know all the amazing things I did for her and that I went to the world of men to give them the mysteries of the Height. So, anyone who understands this should step forward and explain the song Pistis Sophia sang.

CHAPTER 82

After Jesus finished speaking, Philip stepped forward and said, "Jesus, my Lord, I understand the meaning of the song Pistis Sophia sang. The prophet David predicted this in Psalm 106:

1. "Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever.
2. Let those redeemed by the Lord say so, for he has rescued them from their enemies.
3. He has gathered them from different lands, from east, west, north, and south.
4. They wandered in the desert, in a dry land, and couldn't find their way to a city to live in.
5. Hungry and thirsty, they felt faint.
6. They cried out to the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress.
7. He led them on a straight path to a place they could live.
8. Let them thank the Lord for his steadfast love and his wonderful works for humanity.
9. He satisfies the thirsty soul and fills the hungry with good things.
10. Those who sat in darkness and the shadow of death, bound in misery and iron,
11. Because they rebelled against God's words and despised the plans of the Most High."
Their hearts were humbled in their suffering; they became weak and no one helped them.

13. They cried out to the Lord in their distress, and he saved them from their troubles.
14. He led them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke their chains.
15. Let them thank the Lord for his kindness and his wondrous deeds for humanity.
16. For he shattered the bronze gates and broke the iron bars.
17. He saved them from their sins. They were brought low because of their wrongdoings.
18. They lost their appetite and were close to death.
19. They cried out to the Lord in their distress, and he saved them from their troubles.
20. He sent his word and healed them, freeing them from their suffering.
21. Let them thank the Lord for his kindness and his wondrous deeds for humanity.

This, my Lord, is the meaning of the song Pistis Sophia has sung. Listen, my Lord, and I will explain it clearly. The words David spoke: "Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his grace is eternal," are the same as what Pistis Sophia said: "I will give thanks to you, O Light, for you are a savior and deliverer forever."

And the words David spoke: "Let the redeemed of the Lord say this, for he has delivered them from the hand of their foes," are the same as what Pistis Sophia said: "I will sing this song to the Light, for it has saved me from the hand of the rulers, my foes." And so on for the rest of the Psalm.This, my Lord, is the meaning of the song that Pistis Sophia sang among the twenty-four invisibles. She wanted them to understand the wonderful deeds you performed for her and to know that you shared your mysteries with humanity. When Jesus heard Philip say this, he responded, "Well said, blessed Philip. This is the meaning of the song that Pistis Sophia sang."

After all this, Mary approached and worshiped at Jesus' feet, saying, "My Lord, please do not be angry with me for asking questions. We seek clarity and certainty in everything. You previously told us, 'Seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who seeks will find, and to everyone who knocks, it will be opened.' So, my Lord, who should I seek, or who should we knock for? Who can provide us with answers to our questions? Who understands the power of the words we ask about? You have given us enlightenment and elevated thoughts. No one else in the world or in the heights of the aeons can answer our questions, except you, who knows and is perfected in the universe. We do not ask questions like ordinary people; we ask with the understanding and knowledge of the Height that you have given us, following the method of excellent questioning that you have taught us."Now, therefore, my Lord, please don't be angry with me, but tell me about the matter I want to ask you." When Jesus heard Mary Magdalene say this, he responded: "Ask whatever you want, and I will explain it to you clearly and precisely. Truly, I say to you: Be very joyful and celebrate. If you ask with precision, I will be very happy because you are asking in the right way. So, ask what you want, and I will tell you with joy." When Mary heard Jesus say this, she was very happy and said: "My Lord and Savior, what are the twenty-four invisibles like? What type or quality is their light?"

CHAPTER 84

Jesus answered Mary: "What in this world is like them, or what region can compare to them? To what can I compare them, or what can I say about them? Nothing in this world is similar to them, and no form can represent them. Nothing here has the quality of heaven. But truly, I say to you: Each one of the invisibles is nine times greater than heaven, the sphere above it, and the twelve aeons combined, as I have said to you before. And no light in this world is greater than the light of the sun."Truly, truly, I tell you: The twenty-four invisibles shine ten thousand times brighter than the light of the sun in this world, as I have mentioned before. The true light of the sun is not of this world, for its light penetrates through many veils and regions. However, the true light of the sun, which resides in the region of the Virgin of Light, shines ten thousand times brighter than the twenty-four invisibles, the great invisible forefather, and the great triple-powered god, as I have mentioned before.

Mary, there is nothing in this world—no form, no light, no shape—that can compare to the twenty-four invisibles. Soon, I will guide you and your fellow disciples into all the regions of the Height and into the three spaces of the First Mystery, except for the regions of the space of the Ineffable. You will see all their true forms without comparison.

When I lead you into the Height and you witness their glory, you will be greatly amazed. If I lead you into the region of the rulers of Fate, you will see their immense glory. Because of their overwhelming greatness, you will view this world as the darkest of darknesses. You will see the world of men as insignificant as a speck of dust due to the vast distance and the immense greatness that separates it from you.If I lead you into the twelve aeons, you will see their glory. The region of the rulers of Fate will seem like complete darkness to you because of the immense distance and the much greater glory of the aeons.

If I then take you into the thirteenth aeon, you will witness even greater glory. The twelve aeons will appear to you as utter darkness, like a tiny speck of dust in comparison, due to the vast distance and superior glory of the thirteenth aeon.

If I guide you to the region of the Midst, you will see their splendor. The thirteen aeons will seem like total darkness to you. Looking back at the twelve aeons, the whole Fate, and all the spheres, they will appear as mere specks of dust because of the great distance and the much greater glory of the Midst.

If I lead you to the region of those on the Right, you will behold their glory. The region of the Midst will seem as dark as night on earth. When you look back at the Midst, it will appear as a tiny speck of dust due to the vast distance and far superior glory of the region of the Right.If I guide you to the Land of Light, specifically the Treasury of Light, and you witness their glory, the region of those on the Right will seem as insignificant as midday light on a cloudy day. If you compare it to the Treasury of Light, it will appear like a speck of dust due to the vast distance between them. Similarly, if I lead you to the region of those who have received their inheritances and the mysteries of the Light, their glory will make the Land of Light seem like the sun's light in the human world. And if you look upon the Land of Light, it will also seem like a speck of dust because of the great distance and the immense difference in greatness between the two.

CHAPTER 85

After Jesus finished speaking to his disciples, Mary Magdalene stepped forward and said, "My Lord, please don't be angry if I ask questions, for we wish to understand everything clearly." Jesus replied, "Ask what you wish, and I will reveal everything openly and precisely. I will empower and complete you in all knowledge, from the deepest depths to the outermost reaches, from the Ineffable to the darkest darkness, so you will be known as 'the perfected in all knowledge.' Now, Mary, ask your questions, and I will answer them with great joy."Upon hearing the Savior's words, Mary was filled with great joy and exclaimed, "My Lord, will the people of the world who have received the mysteries of the Light be greater than the emanations of the Treasury in your kingdom? I've heard you say that if you lead us into the region of those who have received the mysteries of the Light, then the region of the emanations of the Light-land will seem like a speck of dust because of the vast distance and the great light there. The Light-land is the Treasury, the region of the emanations. So, my Lord, will those who have received the mysteries be superior to the Light-land and its emanations in the kingdom of the Light?"

CHAPTER 86

Jesus replied to Mary, "Your questions are precise and clear. Listen, Mary, as I explain about the end of the age and the ascension of the universe. It will not happen yet. I told you that if I lead you to the region of the inheritances of those who receive the mystery of the Light, then the Treasury of the Light, the region of the emanations, will seem like a speck of dust and as bright as the sun during the day. This will happen at the time of the completion and ascension of the universe."The twelve saviors of the Treasury and their twelve orders, which come from the seven Voices and the five Trees, will be with me in the region of the Light's inheritances. They will be kings with me in my kingdom, each ruling over their own emanations. Each will be a king according to their own glory: the great according to their greatness and the small according to their smallness.

The savior of the emanations of the first Voice will be in the region of the souls who have received the first mystery of the First Mystery in my kingdom. The savior of the emanations of the second Voice will be in the region of the souls who have received the second mystery of the First Mystery. Similarly, the savior of the emanations of the third Voice will be in the region of the souls who have received the third mystery of the First Mystery in the inheritances of the Light.

The savior of the emanations of the fourth Voice of the Treasury of the Light will be in the region of the souls who have received the fourth mystery of the First Mystery in the inheritances of the Light. The fifth savior of the fifth Voice of the Treasury of the Light will be in the region of the souls who have received the fifth mystery of the First Mystery in the inheritances of the Light.

The sixth savior of the emanations of the sixth Voice of the Treasury of the Light will be in the region of the souls who have received the sixth mystery of the First Mystery. The seventh savior of the emanations of the seventh Voice of the Treasury of the Light will be in the region of the souls who have received the seventh mystery of the First Mystery in the Treasury of the Light.The eighth savior, who is the savior of the emanations of the first Tree of the Treasury of Light, will be with the souls who have received the eighth mystery of the First Mystery in the inheritances of Light. 

The ninth savior, who is the savior of the emanations of the second Tree of the Treasury of Light, will be with the souls who have received the ninth mystery of the First Mystery in the inheritances of Light.

The tenth savior, who is the savior of the emanations of the third Tree of the Treasury of Light, will be with the souls who have received the tenth mystery of the First Mystery in the inheritances of Light.

Similarly, the eleventh savior, who is the savior of the emanations of the fourth Tree of the Treasury of Light, will be with the souls who have received the eleventh mystery of the First Mystery in the inheritances of Light.

The twelfth savior, who is the savior of the emanations of the fifth Tree of the Treasury of Light, will be with the souls who have received the twelfth mystery of the First Mystery in the inheritances of Light.

The seven Amens, the five Trees, and the three Amens will be on my right, as kings in the inheritances of Light. The Twin-saviors, who are the Child of the Child, and the nine guards will be on my left, also as kings in the inheritances of Light.

Each savior will rule over their orders of emanations in the inheritances of Light, as they did in the Treasury of Light. The nine guards of the Treasury of Light will outrank the saviors in the inheritances of Light. The Twin-saviors will outrank the nine guards, and the three Amens will outrank the Twin-saviors in the kingdom.The five Trees will be superior to the three Amens in the inheritances of the Light. "Yew, the guardian of the Great Light's veil, the receiver of Light, the two great guides, and the great Sabaoth the Good, will be leaders in the first savior of the first Voice of the Treasury of the Light. This savior will be in the region of those who have received the first mystery of the First Mystery. Indeed, Yew, the guardian of the region of the Right, Melchisedec, the great receiver of the Light, and the two great guides have emerged from the pure and utterly purified light of the first to the fifth Trees.

"Yew is the overseer of the Light, emerging first from the pure light of the first Tree. The guardian of the veil of the Right emerged from the second Tree, and the two guides came forth from the pure and purified light of the third and fourth Trees of the Treasury of the Light. Melchisedec emerged from the fifth Tree, and Sabaoth the Good, whom I call my father, came from Yew, the overseer of the Light.

"These six, by the command of the First Mystery, have been placed in the region of the Right by the last Helper to gather the upper light from the aeons of the rulers, the worlds, and all races within them. I will explain each one's role in the expansion of the universe. Because of their important roles, they will be co-leaders in the first savior of the first Voice of the Treasury of the Light, in the region of the souls who have received the first mystery of the First Mystery.The Virgin of Light and the great guide of the Midst, known as the Great Yew by the rulers of the aeons, along with the Virgin of Light and his twelve ministers—who gave you your shape and power—will be kings with the first savior of the first Voice in the region of the souls who receive the first mystery of the First Mystery in the inheritances of the Light.

The fifteen helpers of the seven virgins of the Light in the Midst will spread out in the regions of the twelve saviors. The other angels of the Midst, each according to his glory, will rule with me in the inheritances of the Light, and I will rule over all of them.

All that I have told you will not happen now but at the end of the aeon, which is the ascension and dissolution of the universe and the complete ascension of the perfect souls in the inheritances of the Light. Until then, everyone will stay in their designated region from the beginning, until the gathering of all perfect souls is complete.

The seven Voices, the five Trees, the three Amens, the Twin-saviors, the nine guards, the twelve saviors, and those from the regions of the Right and the Midst will remain in their assigned regions until all the perfect souls of the inheritances of the Light are raised together.

All rulers who have repented will also stay in their assigned regions until all the souls of the Light are raised together.All the souls will come when it is their time to receive the mysteries. The repentant rulers will move through the regions and reach the Midst. In the Midst, they will be baptized, receive spiritual anointing, and be sealed with the mysteries. They will pass through all regions of the Midst, the Right, and the areas guarded by the nine guards, the Twin Saviors, the three Amens, the twelve Saviors, the five Trees, and the seven Voices. They will receive seals of the mysteries from each region and move into the Inheritance of the Light, where they will stay according to the mysteries they have received.

In short, all human souls who receive the mysteries of the Light will come before the repentant rulers, those in the Midst, and those in the Right and the Treasury of the Light. They will move through all regions and enter the Inheritance of the Light, staying according to their received mysteries. Those in the Midst, the Right, and the Treasury will remain in their designated regions until the universe is uplifted.Here is a modernized and simplified version of the text:

---

Each of them fulfills their duty related to gathering souls who have received the mysteries. Their role is to seal all the souls who will receive the mysteries and pass through their inner selves towards the Inheritance of the Light. "Now, Mary, this is the answer to your precise and certain question. Anyone who has ears to hear should listen."

CHAPTER 87

After Jesus finished speaking, Mary Magdalene stepped forward and said:

"My Lord, I understand every word you say. You have said that all human souls who receive the mysteries of the Light will enter the Inheritance of the Light before all the rulers who repent and before those in the entire region of the Right and the Treasury of the Light. Because of this, my Lord, you previously said: 'The first will be last and the last will be first.' This means that the entire human race, who are considered 'last,' will enter the Light-kingdom before those from the region of the Height, who are the 'first.' That is why you said: 'Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear,' to see if we understand your words. This is the meaning, my Lord."

When Mary finished speaking, Jesus was greatly impressed by her understanding. He said to her: "Well done, spiritual and pure Mary. This is the correct interpretation."

---CHAPTER 88

After saying all these things, Jesus continued speaking to his disciples: "Listen, so I can talk to you about the glory of those in the Highest place, just as I have told you before. If I take you to the realm of the last Helper, who surrounds the Treasury of the Light, and you see his glory, you will see that the region of the Inheritance of the Light would seem as small as a city in this world, because of the greatness of the last Helper and his immense light.

"After that, I will also tell you about the glory of the Helper who is above the little Helper. But I cannot describe the regions of those above all Helpers, because there is nothing in this world to compare them to. There is no likeness, greatness, or light in this world that matches them, nor even from the Height of Righteousness upwards. Therefore, I cannot describe them here because of their immense glory and immeasurable greatness."

When Jesus finished speaking, Mary Magdalene stepped forward and said to him: "My Lord, please do not be angry with me for asking more questions. I ask because I want to understand everything clearly. Please, do not be angry with me for wanting precise and certain answers."My brothers will announce it to all people so they can hear, repent, and be saved from the violent judgments of the evil rulers and reach the Light-kingdom. We are compassionate not only towards ourselves but towards all humanity, so they can be saved from these violent judgments. Because of this, my Lord, we seek certainty in all matters, as my brothers spread the message to all people, so they can escape the dark rulers and be saved from the violent beings in the deepest darkness."

When Jesus heard Mary say these words, he responded with great compassion: "Ask whatever you wish, and I will reveal it to you clearly and precisely."

CHAPTER 89

When Mary heard the Savior say these words, she was filled with great joy and asked Jesus: "My Lord, how much greater is the second Helper compared to the first? How much farther or brighter is he?"

Jesus answered Mary among the disciples: "Truly, the second Helper is vastly greater and more distant than the first in terms of height, depth, length, and breadth. He is exceedingly distant through the angels, archangels, gods, and all the unseen beings. He is significantly greater than the first Helper by an immeasurable degree through all these beings."He shines far brighter than the previous one, with an immeasurable light. No angel, archangel, god, or invisible being can measure it, as I previously told you. Similarly, the third, fourth, and fifth Helpers each shine more brilliantly than the one before them, and are separated by a vast, immeasurable distance through angels, archangels, gods, and all invisibles, as I have mentioned before. I will also explain the nature of each one as they expand.

CHAPTER 90

After Jesus finished speaking to his disciples, Mary Magdalene stepped forward and asked, "My Lord, what will be the state of those who have received the mystery of the Light among the last Helper?"

Jesus replied to Mary in front of the disciples, "Those who have received the mystery of the Light, when they leave the physical body, will be placed in their respective orders according to the mystery they have received. Those with higher mysteries will be in higher orders, and those with lower mysteries will be in lower orders. Essentially, each person will be in the region corresponding to the mysteries they have received, in the Inheritance of the Light. That is why I have previously said, 'Where your heart is, there will your treasure be.' This means that each person will be in the place that matches the mysteries they have received."When Jesus had finished speaking to his disciples, John approached him and said, "Lord and Savior, please allow me to speak and don't be angry if I ask detailed questions. You promised to reveal everything I ask. So, Lord, please don't hide anything from us."

Jesus, with great compassion, replied, "Blessed and beloved John, I give you permission to speak freely, and I will answer all your questions clearly."

John then asked, "Lord, will each person stay in the region where they have received the mysteries? Can they move to higher or lower orders?"

In Chapter 91, Jesus answered, "You ask very precise and detailed questions, John. Listen carefully. Anyone who has received the mysteries of the Light will stay in the region corresponding to those mysteries. They cannot move to higher orders. However, someone who has received the mysteries of the first Commandment can move to the lower orders, but not to the higher ones."Anyone who receives the secrets of the First Mystery, which is the 24th mystery from outside and the leader of the first space outside, has the ability to enter all the orders below them but cannot access or pass through the regions above them.

Those who receive the mysteries within the orders of the 24 mysteries will each go to the region where they received their mysteries and can pass through all the orders and spaces below them, but they cannot enter the higher orders above them or pass through them.

Anyone who has received mysteries in the orders of the First Mystery in the third space can enter all the lower orders below them and pass through them all. However, they do not have the ability to enter or pass through the regions above them.

Anyone who has received the mysteries of the first Thrice-spiritual, which governs the 24 mysteries together that rule the space of the First Mystery, can descend into all the orders below them but cannot enter the higher orders above them in the space of the Ineffable.

Anyone who has received the mysteries of the second Thrice-spiritual has the power to enter and pass through all the orders of the first Thrice-spiritual and all their orders but cannot enter the higher orders of the third Thrice-spiritual.Here is the text converted into modern English, simplified, and corrected without altering its original meaning:

---

Anyone who has received the mystery of the third Thrice-spiritual, which governs the three Thrice-spirituals and the three spaces of the First Mystery, has the power to enter all the orders below him. However, he does not have the power to ascend to the higher orders, specifically those in the space of the Ineffable.

Anyone who has received the master-mystery of the First Mystery of the Ineffable, which includes the twelve mysteries of the First Mystery that govern all its spaces, has the power to traverse all the orders within the spaces of the three Thrice-spirituals and the three spaces of the First Mystery. This person can move through all the orders of the inheritances of the Light, moving from outside to inside, inside to outside, above to below, below to above, and in all directions. In summary, this person can pass through all regions of the Light's inheritance and can reside wherever they choose within the Light-kingdom.

Truly, I tell you: That person will, at the end of the world, be king over all the orders of the Light's inheritance. Whoever receives the mystery of the Ineffable that I am,

will understand why darkness and light have arisen. This mystery reveals the reasons behind the emergence of the deepest darkness and the greatest light. It explains the origins of chaos and the treasury of light.

This mystery also explains why judgments have come to be and why the land of light and the region of the light's inheritances have arisen.And that mystery knows why the punishments of sinners have come about and why the blessings of the kingdom of light have come about.

And that mystery knows why murmuring has arisen and why innocence and humility have arisen. 

And that mystery knows why sin has arisen and why purity has arisen.Here is the text converted into modern English, simplified without altering its original meaning:

CHAPTER 92

After Jesus finished speaking to his disciples, they were filled with great joy and celebrated when they heard his words. Jesus continued his teaching and said to them: "Listen further, my disciples, as I explain the complete knowledge of the mystery of the Ineffable.

This revision maintains the original meaning while making the language more contemporary and easier to understand.And the mystery knows why the waters of the earth and everything in them have come to be, and why the earth itself has come to be.

"And that mystery knows why the seas and the creatures within them have come to be. "And that mystery knows why the matter of the world has come to be and why it will eventually be destroyed."

CHAPTER 93

Jesus continued and said to his disciples: "Furthermore, my disciples and companions and brothers, let everyone be sober in spirit and understand all the words I will say to you; for now I will begin to speak to you about all the knowledge of the Ineffable. "That mystery knows why the west has come to be and why the east has come to be. "And that mystery knows why the south has come to be and why the north has come to be. Furthermore, my disciples, listen and continue to be sober and listen to the complete knowledge of the mystery of the Ineffable.

CHAPTER 94

And Jesus continued again and said to his disciples: "Furthermore, O my disciples, be sober, and let each of you bring forth the power to perceive the Light before you, so that you may sense it with certainty."Starting from now, I will speak to you truthfully about the entire region of the Ineffable and explain its nature." When the disciples heard Jesus say this, they became silent and stopped questioning. Then Mary Magdalene approached, fell at Jesus' feet, kissed them, and cried out: "Have mercy on me, Lord, for my brothers heard your words but did not understand them. You told me you would explain the complete knowledge of the mystery of the Ineffable, but you didn't finish your explanation. This is why my brothers have stopped trying to understand your words. If the knowledge of all this is within that mystery, who in this world is capable of understanding it and the meaning of what you have said?"

CHAPTER 95

When Jesus heard Mary speak and realized that the disciples had given up, he reassured them: "Do not be troubled about the mystery of the Ineffable, thinking you cannot understand it. Truly, this mystery is for you and everyone who listens to you, provided they renounce this world and all its concerns and reject all evil thoughts. Now, I tell you..."For anyone who renounces the entire world and everything in it and submits to the divine, that mystery is much easier to understand than all the mysteries of the Light-kingdom. It is simpler to grasp compared to them all. Whoever attains the knowledge of this mystery will abandon this whole world and all its worries. 

This is why I have previously said to you, "All who are burdened, come to me, and I will refresh you. For my burden is light and my yoke is gentle." Therefore, anyone who accepts this mystery renounces the entire world and all its concerns. For this reason, my disciples, do not be troubled, thinking you won't understand the mystery. Truly, I tell you: This mystery is much easier to understand than all other mysteries. And truly, I tell you: This mystery belongs to you and to everyone who renounces the whole world and everything in it.

So now, listen, my disciples, companions, and brothers, so that I may guide you towards understanding the mystery of the Ineffable. I have already told you about the complete knowledge that comes with the expansion of the universe; for the expansion of the universe is its knowledge.

But now, listen as I explain to you step by step about the knowledge of that mystery. This mystery understands why the five Helpers have separated and why they came forth from the Fatherless. It understands why the great Light of lights separated and why it came forth from the Fatherless. It also understands why the first Commandment separated and divided itself into the seven mysteries, why it is called the first Commandment, and why it came forth from the Fatherless.And that mystery knows why the Great Light of the Impressions of the Light has split itself apart, why it has established itself without emanations, and why it has emerged from the Fatherless.

And that mystery knows why the Super-deeps have split themselves apart, why they have distributed themselves as a single order, and why they have come forth from the Fatherless.Here is the simplified and modernized version of the text:

"And that mystery knows why all the Uncontainables have split apart—those I have just mentioned, which are in the regions of the second space of the Ineffable, the space of the First Mystery, and why those Uncontainables and Boundless have emerged from the Fatherless."The mystery understands why the twenty-four mysteries of the first Thrice-spiritual have separated and why they are called the twenty-four spaces of the first Thrice-spiritual, and why they emerged from the second Thrice-spiritual.

**Chapter 96**

"I will explain to you about the expansion of the universe—all those I have mentioned to you: those who will arise and come, those who emanate and emerge, those who have no one over them, and those who are implanted within them. I will speak of those who will encompass the region of the First Mystery and those in the space of the Ineffable. I will reveal these to you and speak about them according to each region and order, during the expansion of the universe. I will disclose all their mysteries, which govern them all, including their Pro-thrice-spirituals and Super-thrice-spirituals that rule over their mysteries and orders.

"Therefore, the mystery of the Ineffable understands why all these beings I have openly mentioned to you have arisen, and through what means they have come into existence."

---It is the mystery within all things; it is their beginning, their ascension, and their establishment. "The mystery of the Ineffable is the same mystery present in everything I have spoken to you about, and will speak about when the universe expands. It is the one and only mystery of the Ineffable and the knowledge of all that I have mentioned and will mention, even those I haven't mentioned yet. I will explain this to you when the universe expands and how all these mysteries are interconnected and why they have emerged. It is the sole word of the Ineffable.

"I will reveal the expansion of all mysteries, their types, and how they are completed. I will explain the mystery of the One, the Ineffable, including all its types, figures, and complete structure, and why it emerged from the last part of the Ineffable. This mystery is the foundation of everything. 

"The mystery of the Ineffable is a single word, existing in the speech of the Ineffable, and it organizes the solution to all the words I have spoken to you. Whoever receives this word and understands its types, figures, and the way to accomplish its mystery—because you are perfect and complete, and you will achieve the full knowledge of this mystery with all its structure, since all mysteries are entrusted to you—listen now as I reveal this mystery to you."Who will receive the unique word of that mystery I have told you about? If someone comes out of the body controlled by the rulers, and if the retributive receivers free them from the body of matter, then the soul will be released. These receivers free all outgoing souls from the body.

When the retributive receivers free the soul that has received this one and only mystery of the Ineffable, it will immediately become a great stream of light among them. The receivers will be very afraid of the light from that soul, and they will become powerless and fall down in fear of the great light they have seen.

The soul that receives the mystery of the Ineffable will soar to great heights as a stream of light. The receivers will not be able to capture it or understand the path it takes. It becomes a great light-stream and ascends high, beyond the reach of any power. No force will be able to come near it.

The soul will pass through all the regions of the rulers and the emanations of the Light without giving any answers, apologies, or tokens. None of the powers of the rulers or the Light's emanations will be able to approach the soul. All the regions of the rulers and the emanations of the Light will sing praises to it in fear of the light enveloping the soul until it passes through them all. It will finally reach the region of the inheritance of the mystery it has received, becoming one with the One and Only, the Ineffable, and merging with its essence.Truly, I tell you, it will happen throughout all regions in the time it takes a man to shoot an arrow.

Now, truly, I tell you, every man who understands the mystery of the Ineffable and fulfills it in all its forms and symbols:

He is a man in the world, but he rises above all angels and will rise even higher above them.
He is a man in the world, but he rises above all archangels and will rise even higher above them.
He is a man in the world, but he rises above all tyrants and will elevate himself above them.
He is a man in the world, but he rises above all lords and will elevate himself above them.
He is a man in the world, but he rises above all gods and will elevate himself above them.
He is a man in the world, but he rises above all light-givers and will elevate himself above them.
He is a man in the world, but he rises above all pure beings and will elevate himself above them.
He is a man in the world, but he rises above all triple-powers and will elevate himself above them.
He is a man in the world, but he rises above all forefathers and will elevate himself above them.
He is a man in the world, but he rises above all invisible beings and will elevate himself above them.
He is a man in the world, but he rises above the great invisible forefather and will elevate himself above him.

He is a man in the world, but he rises above all those of the Midst and will elevate himself above them.
He is a man in the world, but he rises above the emanations of the Treasury of the Light and will elevate himself above them.
He is a man in the world, but he rises above the Mixture and will elevate himself completely above it.
He is a man in the world, but he rises above the entire region of the Treasury and will elevate himself completely above it.
He is a man in the world, but he will rule with me in my kingdom.He is a man in the world, but he is a king in the Light. He is a man in the world, but he doesn't belong to the world. And truly, I tell you: That man is me, and I am that man. 

At the end of the world, when the universe is uplifted, and the count of perfect souls is gathered, I will be king among the final Helper. I will rule over all the emanations of the Light, the seven Amens, the five Trees, the three Amens, the nine guards, and the Child of the Child (the Twin Saviors). I will be king over the twelve saviors and the entire assembly of perfect souls who receive the mysteries in the Light. All those who receive the mysteries in the Ineffable will be fellow-kings with me and will sit on my right and left in my kingdom.

And truly, I tell you: Those people are me, and I am them. That's why I told you before: 'You will sit on your thrones on my right and left in my kingdom and rule with me.' This is why I haven't hesitated or been ashamed to call you my brothers and companions because you will be fellow-kings with me in my kingdom. I say this, knowing that I will give you the mystery of the Ineffable; that mystery is me, and I am that mystery. 

Not only will you reign with me, but all who receive the mystery of the Ineffable will be fellow-kings with me in my kingdom. I am them, and they are me. But my throne will be above theirs. Because you will endure more sorrows in the world than anyone else until you spread all the words I speak to you, your thrones will be joined to mine in my kingdom. That's why I told you before: 'Where I am, there will be my twelve ministers also.'But Mary Magdalene and John, the virgin, will stand above all my disciples and all men who receive the mysteries in the Ineffable. They will be on my right and left. I am they, and they are I. And they will be like you in all things, except that your thrones will be higher than theirs, and my throne will be higher than yours. And all men who find the word of the Ineffable—truly, I say to you: Those who know that word will understand the knowledge of all these words which I have spoken to you, both those of the depth and those of the height, those of the length and those of the breadth. In short, they will know the knowledge of all these words I have spoken to you and those I have yet to speak, which I will speak to you, region by region and order by order, as the universe expands. Truly, I say to you: They will know how the world is established, they will know the nature of all those in the heights, and they will know the foundation from which the universe has arisen.

CHAPTER 97

After the Savior said this, Mary Magdalene stepped forward and said: "My Lord, please bear with me and do not be angry if I ask questions precisely and clearly. Now, my Lord, is the word of the mystery of the Ineffable different from the word of the whole knowledge?" The Savior answered: "Yes, the mystery of the Ineffable is different from the word of the whole knowledge." And Mary asked again: "My Lord, please bear with me if I question you further. Now, my Lord, if we do not live and know the knowledge of the whole word of the Ineffable, will we still be able to inherit the Light-kingdom?" And the Savior answered...And said to Mary, "Surely, everyone who receives a mystery of the Light-kingdom will inherit the region corresponding to the mysteries they have received. However, they will not understand the knowledge of the universe unless they know the one and only word of the Ineffable, which is the true knowledge of the universe. I am that knowledge. It is impossible to know this one word unless a person first receives the mystery of the Ineffable.

Those who receive mysteries in the Light will inherit the region corresponding to the mysteries they have received. This is why I have previously said, 'He who has faith in a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and he who has faith in a righteous person will receive a righteous person's reward.' Everyone will go to the region corresponding to the mysteries they have received. Those who receive a lesser mystery will inherit the lesser region, and those who receive a higher mystery will inherit the higher regions. Each person will remain in their region within the light of my kingdom, having power over the orders below them but not over the orders above them. They will remain in the region of the Inheritance of the Light in my kingdom, experiencing great light, joy, and jubilation.

Now listen, so I can tell you about the greatness of those who receive the mysteries of the First Mystery. When someone receives the first mystery of the First Mystery and leaves their physical body, the retributive receivers will come and guide their soul out of the body."The soul will become a powerful stream of light in the hands of the retributive receivers, and these receivers will be afraid of its light. The soul will rise and pass through all the regions of the rulers and the Light's emanations, without needing to give answers, apologies, or tokens in any region. It will move through and surpass all regions, ultimately ruling over them as the first savior.

Similarly, those who receive the second, third, fourth, and up to the twelfth mystery of the First Mystery, when they leave their physical body, will be led by the retributive receivers. These souls will also become powerful streams of light, causing the receivers to be afraid and fall powerless. The souls will soar upwards, crossing all regions of the rulers and the Light's emanations, without providing answers or tokens. They will surpass all regions and rule over those of the twelve saviors. Each will rule over the regions of the savior whose mystery they have received.

In the same way, those who receive the third, fourth, fifth, and up to the twelfth mystery of the First Mystery will rule over the regions of the savior corresponding to the mystery they have received."And anyone who receives the twelfth mystery of the First Mystery, which is the master-mystery I’m discussing with you, and thus receives all twelve mysteries of the First Mystery, will, upon leaving this world, pass through all the regions of the rulers and the Light as a great light-stream. This person will also rule over the regions of the twelve saviors, but they won’t be like those who receive the single mystery of the Ineffable. Those who receive these mysteries will remain in exalted orders and in the orders of the twelve saviors."

CHAPTER 98

When Jesus finished speaking to his disciples, Mary Magdalene stepped forward, kissed his feet, and said, "My Lord, please bear with me and do not be angry if I ask you a question. Have mercy on us and reveal everything we ask. How does the First Mystery have twelve mysteries, while the Ineffable has only one mystery?"

Jesus replied, "Indeed, the Ineffable has one mystery, but that mystery comprises three different mysteries, even though it is one. It also comprises five mysteries, yet it remains one. These five mysteries are similar in the kingdom of the Light's inheritances, but each one is different in type."Their kingdom is higher and more exalted than the entire kingdom of the twelve mysteries combined of the First Mystery. However, they are not the same as the one and only mystery of the First Mystery in the Light-kingdom. Likewise, the three mysteries are not the same in the Light-kingdom; each one is different. They are also not the same as the one and only mystery of the First Mystery in the Light-kingdom; each one of the three has a different form and configuration.

If you fully accomplish the first mystery of the First Mystery and perform it correctly in all its aspects, you will immediately leave your body, become a great stream of light, and pass through all the regions of the rulers and the Light. All will be in awe of that soul until it reaches its kingdom.

If you correctly perform the second mystery of the First Mystery in all its aspects, and if you speak this mystery over the head of someone who is leaving their body, and into their ears, if they have received the mysteries again and share in the word of truth—truly, I tell you: that person, if they leave their physical body, their soul will become a great stream of light and pass through all the regions until it reaches the kingdom of that mystery.If a person has not received any sacred teachings and does not share in the words of truth, and if someone performs a sacred ritual over the head of someone who has just died and who has not received any spiritual teachings or the words of truth, then I tell you: That person will not be judged or punished in any region of the rulers, nor will fire touch him, because of the great mystery of the Ineffable that is with him.

They will quickly pass him from one region to another, from one order to another, until they bring him before the Virgin of Light. All the regions will be in awe of the mystery and the sign of the kingdom of the Ineffable that he carries. When he is brought before the Virgin of Light, she will see the sign of the mystery of the kingdom of the Ineffable with him. She will be amazed and test him but will not allow him to enter the Light until he has completed the full purification of renouncing the world and its material aspects.

The Virgin of Light will seal him with a higher seal and will allow him, in the month he has left his physical body, to descend into a righteous body. In this new body, he will find godliness in truth and the higher mysteries so that he may inherit them and the eternal Light, which is the gift of the second mystery of the First Mystery of the Ineffable.

For the third mystery of the Ineffable, if a person completes and accomplishes that mystery, not only will he inherit the kingdom of the mystery when he leaves his body, but if he completes that mystery...If someone fully understands and completes the mystery, and speaks its name over a person who has just died and known the mystery—regardless of whether it was delayed—the person who has died will be rescued from the severe punishments and judgments of the rulers and their many fires. Truly, I say to you: If the name of this mystery is spoken on behalf of the deceased, they will be quickly transferred and handed over from one to another until they reach the Virgin of Light. The Virgin of Light will mark them with a higher seal, and in that month, she will guide them into a righteous body that truly finds the divine and the higher mystery, so they may inherit the Light-kingdom. This is the gift of the third mystery of the Ineffable.

Now, anyone who receives one of the five mysteries of the Ineffable, when they die and ascend to the region of that mystery, will find that the kingdom of those five mysteries is higher than the kingdom of the twelve mysteries of the First Mystery, and higher than all the mysteries below them. The five mysteries of the Ineffable are equal to each other in their kingdom, but they are not the same as the three mysteries of the Ineffable.

On the other hand, whoever receives the three mysteries of the Ineffable, when they die, will ascend to the kingdom of that mystery. These three mysteries are equal to each other in their kingdom and are higher and more exalted than the five mysteries of the Ineffable, but they are not the same as the one and only mystery of the Ineffable.Anyone who receives the one and only mystery of the Ineffable will inherit the entire kingdom in all its glory, as I have mentioned before. Those who receive the mystery of the universe of the Ineffable and other related mysteries, which I haven’t yet discussed, will understand their structure and purpose when I explain the universe's expansion. These mysteries are connected to the unapproachable God, the One and Only.

The extent to which one receives these mysteries in the space of the Ineffable dictates the region they will inherit. In this region, there are no signs, responses, or explanations, for it is a place beyond such things. Those who receive these mysteries will pass through all regions until they reach the kingdom of the mystery they have received.

Similarly, those who receive mysteries in the second space also encounter no signs or responses. This second space pertains to the first mystery of the First Mystery.

In the third space, every region has its own structure and purpose.Certainly! Here is the text converted into modern English, corrected, and simplified while maintaining the original meaning:

**Chapter 99**

When Jesus finished speaking to his disciples, Mary Magdalene stepped forward and asked, "My Lord, how long is a year of the Light compared to the years of the world?"

Jesus answered, "A day in the realm of the Light is a thousand years in the world. Therefore, thirty-six thousand and five hundred years in the world equal one year of the Light. 

"I will rule for a thousand years of the Light as king over all the emanations of the Light and over all the perfect souls who have received the mysteries of the Light. 

"You, my disciples, and everyone who receives the mystery of the Ineffable, will be beside me, ruling as kings in my kingdom. 

"Those who receive the three mysteries of the Ineffable will also be kings in the Light-kingdom but will be behind you who receive the mystery of the Ineffable.

"Similarly, those who receive the five mysteries of the Ineffable will also be kings but will be behind those who receive the three mysteries."

---

This version keeps the essential message intact while making it easier to understand.Those who receive the twelfth mystery of the First Mystery will stay behind the five mysteries of the Ineffable and be kings according to their order. All who receive mysteries in the space of the Ineffable will also be kings and will stand before those who receive the First Mystery, according to their glory. Those who receive higher mysteries will be in higher regions, and those who receive lower mysteries will be in lower regions, all as kings in the light of my kingdom. This is the division of the kingdom of the first space of the Ineffable.

Those who receive all the mysteries of the second space, which is the space of the First Mystery, will also be in the light of my kingdom, according to their glory and the mystery they have received. Those who receive higher mysteries will be in higher regions, and those who receive lower mysteries will be in lower regions in the light of my kingdom. This is the division for those who receive the mystery of the second space of the First Mystery.

Those who receive the mysteries of the third space, which is the first space from the outside, will stay behind the second king in the light of my kingdom, according to their glory and the mysteries they have received. Those who receive higher mysteries will be in higher regions, and those who receive lower mysteries will be in lower regions.

These are the three divisions of the Light-kingdom. The mysteries of these three divisions are very numerous and can be found in the two great Books of Yew.Sure, here's the simplified and modernized version of the text:

---

But I will share with you the great mysteries of every realm, especially those higher than all others. These mysteries are the key leaders of each realm and order, guiding humanity to higher regions according to their inheritance. You don't need the lower mysteries, but you can find them in the two Books of Yew, which Enoch wrote while I spoke to him from the tree of knowledge and the tree of life in the paradise of Adam.

Once I explain everything to you, I will reveal the great mysteries of the three divisions of my kingdom. These are the main mysteries, which I will describe to you in all their forms, symbols, codes, and final seals. I will also tell you the meanings and signs of that realm.

The second realm inside has no meanings, signs, codes, or seals, but only forms and symbols.

CHAPTER 100

After the Saviour had finished speaking to his disciples, Andrew stepped forward and said: "My Lord, please don't be angry with me, but show mercy and explain the mystery of the word I will ask about, for it has been hard for me to understand." The Saviour replied: "Ask your question, and I will reveal the answer to you directly, without any parables."

---Andrew responded, "My Lord, I am amazed and find it hard to understand how people in this world, when they leave their bodies, can pass through all these realms, rulers, lords, gods, and invisible beings, and enter the Light-kingdom. This seems very difficult to me."

Upon hearing this, the spirit of the Savior stirred within him, and he exclaimed, "How long must I tolerate you? Do you still not understand? Don’t you know that you, along with all angels, archangels, gods, lords, rulers, and invisible beings, and all those in the Midst and the Right, are made of the same essence and substance? All of you come from the same mixture.

"By the command of the First Mystery, the mixture was refined until all beings of the Light and their glory were purified from it. They did not purify themselves by their own will but out of necessity, following the plan of the Ineffable One.

"They have not suffered or changed in the regions; they have not been torn apart or placed into different bodies, nor have they experienced any affliction."You are the remnants of the Treasury, the Right region, the Midst region, and all the invisibles and rulers. In short, you are the remnants of everything. You endure great sufferings, being transferred from one body to another in the world. Despite these sufferings, you have fought and renounced the entire world and its material things. You have persistently sought until you found all the mysteries of the Kingdom of Light, which purified and transformed you into exceedingly pure light.

This is why I previously told you, "Seek, and you will find." You must seek the mysteries of the Light, which purify the body of matter and turn it into refined, exceedingly pure light. 

Truly, I say to you: For the sake of humanity, because they are material beings, I have divided myself and brought them all the mysteries of the Light to purify them. Without these purifying mysteries, no human soul could be saved, and they could not inherit the Kingdom of Light. These mysteries are not needed by the beings of Light, for they are already pure; it is humanity that needs them because they are material remnants. 

This is why I previously said, "The healthy do not need a doctor, but the sick do." In other words, those of the Light do not need the mysteries because they are purified lights, but humanity needs them because they are material remnants."Therefore, tell everyone: Do not stop seeking day and night until you find the purifying mysteries. Tell them to renounce the whole world and everything in it. Those who buy and sell, eat and drink, and live in the world's worries and associations only gather more impurities. Everything in this world is material refuse, and everyone will be questioned about their purity.

"For this reason, I have told you before: Renounce the whole world and everything in it so you do not gather more impurities. Tell everyone: Renounce the whole world and its associations so you do not gather more impurities. Tell them to seek continuously, day and night, until they find the purifying mysteries that will cleanse them and turn them into refined light, allowing them to ascend and inherit the light of my kingdom.

"Now, Andrew, and all your fellow disciples, because of your renunciations and all your sufferings in every place, and because of your transformations and experiences in different bodies, and all your afflictions, you have received the purifying mysteries and have become exceedingly purified light. For this reason, you will ascend and penetrate all the regions of the great emanations of the Light and be kings in the Light-kingdom forever."If you leave your physical body and ascend to the realm of the rulers, they will feel ashamed in your presence because you, made from their discarded matter, have become purer light than any of them. If you reach the regions of the Great Invisible, the Midst, the Right, and all the great emanations of the Light, you will be honored among them because you are the refined light from their discarded matter. All these regions will praise you until you arrive at the kingdom.

This answers your question. Now, Andrew, do you still doubt and lack understanding?

When the Savior said this, Andrew and all the disciples understood clearly that they would inherit the Light-kingdom. They all fell at Jesus' feet, crying and asking for forgiveness on behalf of their brother for his ignorance. The Savior replied, "I forgive and will continue to forgive; this is why the First Mystery sent me, so that I may forgive everyone's sins."

CHAPTER 101

[THE CONCLUSION OF ANOTHER BOOK]

Those worthy of the mysteries in the Ineffable, which have not yet manifested, exist before the First Mystery. To help you understand, think of them as the Limbs of the Ineffable. Each exists according to the glory of its position: the head according to the glory of the head, and the eye according to the glory of the eye.In simpler modern English, the text can be rewritten as follows:

---

The eyes and ears have their own importance, just like all other body parts. This shows clearly that there are many different parts, but only one body. I have spoken in metaphors and comparisons, not in literal truth. I have only revealed the mystery, not the whole truth of the Ineffable.

All the body parts, according to the metaphor I used, relate to the mystery of the Ineffable. There are three levels of this mystery. I am the keeper of all these truths, and there is no other like me. However, there are still other mysteries and regions.

Blessed is the person who finds the words of the mysteries of the first level, which is external. Such a person is like a god if they find the words of the mysteries of the second level, which is in the middle. Someone who finds the words of the mysteries of the third, innermost level is like a savior, greater than the universe and similar to those in that third level. This is because they have discovered the mystery that defines and sustains that level.

Anyone who understands these mysteries, which I have described using comparisons, is like the First, the Ineffable. I tell you truly, the person who grasps these divine mysteries is foremost in truth and similar to the Ineffable. The universe exists and is sustained by this First. Therefore, anyone who finds the words of these mysteries is like the First.

---

Tell those who spread false teachings and those who follow them: Woe to you. If you do not repent and abandon your errors, you will face the punishments of the great dragon and the outer darkness, which is extremely evil. You will never return to the world and will remain nonexistent until the end.

Tell those who abandon the true teachings of the First Mystery: Woe to you. Your punishment is sadder than that of all others. You will remain in the great cold, ice, and hail in the midst of the dragon and the outer darkness. You will never return to the world, but will be frozen in that place. At the end of the universe, you will perish and become eternally nonexistent.

Tell the people of the world: Be calm, so that you may receive the mysteries of the Light and ascend to the Light-kingdom.

---Tell them: Be good so you can receive the mysteries of the Light and ascend to the Light-kingdom. Tell them: Give up everything so you can receive the mysteries of the Light and ascend to the Light-kingdom. These are the paths for those worthy of the mysteries of the Light. For those who have renounced everything, give them the mysteries of the Light and do not hide them, even if they have sinned and committed all kinds of wrongs. I have listed these wrongs so they can repent and submit as I have described. Give them the mysteries of the Light-kingdom and do not hide them, because I brought these mysteries into the world to forgive all their sins from the beginning. This is why I said before: 'I did not come to call the righteous.' Now, I have brought the mysteries so everyone's sins can be forgiven and they can enter the Light-kingdom. The mysteries are a gift from the First Mystery to erase the sins and wrongs of all sinners.

Chapter 103

After Jesus finished speaking to his disciples, Mary stepped forward and asked, "Lord, if a person is perfectly righteous and has no sin, will they face punishment and judgment or will they be brought into the kingdom of heaven?"And the Savior answered and said to Mary: "A righteous man who has perfected all righteousness and has never committed any sin, but who has never received the mysteries of the Light, if the time comes for him to leave his body, then immediately the receivers of one of the great triple-powers come. They take the soul of that man from the hands of the retributive receivers and spend three days circling with it among all the creatures of the world. After three days, they lead it down into the chaos to experience all the punishments of judgment. The fires of chaos do not trouble it much but will affect it for a short time.

"And then they quickly take pity on it and lead it out of chaos, guiding it through all the rulers. These rulers do not harshly judge it, but the fire of their regions troubles it a little. If it reaches the region of Yachthanabas, the pitiless one, he cannot punish it with his evil judgments, but he holds it briefly while the fire of his punishments troubles it a bit. Again, they quickly take pity on it and lead it out of his regions. They do not bring it into the aeons so that the rulers of the aeons do not capture it, but instead, they bring it along the way of the sun to the Virgin of Light. She examines it and finds it pure of sins but does not allow it to enter the Light because it lacks the sign of the kingdom of the mystery. She seals it with a higher seal and sends it back into a righteous body, one that will be able to find the signs of the mysteries of the Light and inherit the Light-kingdom forever."If, on the other hand, he has sinned once, twice, or three times, he will be sent back into the world based on the type of sins he committed, which I will explain after I talk about the expansion of the universe. But truly, I tell you: Even if a righteous person has committed no sins at all, they cannot enter the Light-kingdom because they do not have the sign of the kingdom of the mysteries. In short, it is impossible to bring souls into the Light without the mysteries of the Light-kingdom.

CHAPTER 104

Once Jesus had finished speaking to his disciples, John stepped forward and said: "My Lord, what if a sinful man, who has committed many wrongdoings, stops sinning for the sake of the kingdom of heaven and renounces the entire world and everything in it? We then give him the mysteries of the Light from the beginning, and if he accepts these mysteries but later sins again, and then once more repents and stops sinning, and...Renounce the entire world and everything in it, so that he comes back and deeply repents. If we truly know that he yearns for God, we should give him the second mystery of the first space from outside. Similarly, if he turns back to sin and then repents again, renouncing the world and everything in it, and we are certain that he is sincere, we should give him the mysteries from the beginning in the first space from outside. If he sins again and continues in all kinds of sins, should we forgive him up to seven times and give him the mysteries in the first space from outside up to seven times?

The Saviour replied to John: "Not only forgive him up to seven times, but truly, I say to you, forgive him many times seven times, and each time give him the mysteries from the beginning in the first space from outside. You might save the soul of that brother, and he may inherit the Light-kingdom.

"For this reason, when you asked me before, 'If our brother sins against us, should we forgive him up to seven times?' I answered with a parable, saying, 'Not just seven times, but seventy times seven.' Therefore, forgive him many times and each time give him the mysteries in the first space from outside. You might save the soul of that brother, and he may inherit the Light-kingdom."Sure, here is the simplified and modernized version of the text:

---

Amen, amen, I tell you: Whoever saves even one soul will gain an additional honor in the Kingdom of Light, on top of the honor they already have. So, if someone saves many souls, they will receive many additional honors for each soul saved.

---

CHAPTER 105

After the Savior said this, John stepped forward and asked, "My Lord, please allow me to question you, for I want to understand how we should share this with mankind. If I give a brother one of the initial mysteries and many other mysteries, but he doesn't live up to the standards of the Kingdom of Heaven, should we let him move on to the second set of mysteries? Maybe we can help that brother repent and inherit the Kingdom of Light. Should we let him continue to the second set of mysteries or not?"

The Savior answered John, "If the brother genuinely seeks God and isn't pretending, and if you've given him the initial mysteries many times but he hasn't met the standards because of the circumstances of fate, then forgive him. Let him move on and give him the first mystery of the second set. Maybe we can save that brother's soul."If someone has not lived up to the standards of the mysteries of the Light and has committed various sins, but later repents deeply, renounces the world, and truly stops sinning, and you can be sure he is sincere in his longing for God, then you should forgive him, let him move forward, and give him the second mystery in the second space of the First Mystery. This way, you might save his soul and he may inherit the Light-kingdom.

Similarly, if he has sinned but later repents deeply, renounces the world and its matters, and stops sinning, and you truly believe he is sincere in his longing for God, then forgive him and accept his repentance. The First Mystery is compassionate and merciful. Let him pass through and give him the three mysteries in the second space of the First Mystery.

However, if he sins again after that, do not forgive him or accept his repentance. Treat him as a stumbling block and a transgressor. Truly, I say to you, those three mysteries will testify to his last repentance, and he has no further chance for repentance. From that moment onwards, his soul will not return to the higher world but will be in the realms of the dragon of outer darkness.

I have previously told you a parable about such souls, saying: 'If your brother sins against you, address it privately between you and him.'If he listens to you, you will win your brother; if he does not listen to you, take another person with you. If he still does not listen, bring him to the assembly. If he does not listen to the assembly, treat him as a transgressor and a stumbling block. This means: If he does not respond to the first mystery, give him the second; if not the second, give him the third, which is the assembly. If he still does not respond, treat him as a stumbling block and a transgressor.

And the saying: 'So that through two to three witnesses every word may be established,' means that these three mysteries will witness his final repentance. Truly, I say to you, if that person repents, no mystery can forgive his sins or accept his repentance except through the first mystery of the First Mystery and the mysteries of the Ineffable. Only these will accept his repentance and forgive his sins, for these mysteries are compassionate, merciful, and forgiving.

CHAPTER 106

After the Savior said this, John continued and asked, "My Lord, suppose a very sinful brother has renounced the entire world, all its matters, sins, and cares, and we test him and know he is sincere and truly longs for God, and we see he is worthy of the mysteries of the second or third space. Should we give him the mysteries of the second and third space before he has received the mysteries of the Inheritance of the Light? Should we give them to him or not?"And the Savior answered and said to John among the disciples: "If you know for sure that a person has renounced the whole world and all its concerns, associations, and sins, and if you truly know that they are not deceitful, not pretending, nor just curious about the mysteries, but genuinely long for God, do not hide the mysteries from them. Give them the mysteries of the second and third spaces, and test which mystery they are worthy of. Give them what they are worthy of and do not hide it from them, for if you do, you may be guilty of great condemnation.

"If you give them the mysteries of the second or third space and they sin again, you should continue to give them up to the second or third time. If they still sin, do not continue to give them, for those three mysteries will testify to their last repentance. Truly, I say to you: Whoever gives that person the mysteries of the second or third space again is guilty of great condemnation. Treat them as a transgressor and a stumbling block.

"Truly, I say to you: The soul of that person cannot return to the world from this point onwards; their place is in the jaws of the dragon of outer darkness, the region of wailing and gnashing of teeth. At the end of the world, their soul will be frozen and perish in extreme cold and fire, becoming non-existent forever.

"Even if they renounce the whole world again, with great repentance and citizenship, no mystery can accept their repentance or forgive their sins, except the mystery of the First Mystery and the mystery of the Ineffable."These alone will accept a man's repentance and forgive his sins, because these mysteries are compassionate, merciful, and forgiving of sins at all times.

CHAPTER 107

After the Savior said this, John continued and asked: "My Lord, please bear with me if I ask questions, and do not be angry with me. I seek to understand everything clearly so that we can teach it to the people of the world." The Savior replied to John: "Ask whatever you need to, and I will reveal it to you openly and clearly." John then asked: "My Lord, if we go to a city or village and the residents come to meet us, pretending to welcome us and invite us into their homes with deceitful intentions, wanting to test the mysteries of the Light-kingdom, and if they pretend to be devoted to God and we give them the mysteries, but later find out they were deceitful and only wanted to test us, and that they have revealed the mysteries to others, what will happen to them?" The Savior answered: "If you enter a city or village and they welcome you into their homes, give them a mystery."If they are worthy, you will win their souls and they will inherit the Light-kingdom. But if they are deceitful and only pretend to understand the mysteries, test you and the mysteries, then call upon the first mystery of the First Mystery, which has mercy on everyone, and say: "You Mystery, which we have shared with these impious and iniquitous souls who have not respected your mystery but have pretended to, take back the mystery and make them forever strangers to the mystery of your kingdom." Shake the dust off your feet as a witness against them, saying: "May your souls be as the dust of your house." Truly, I say to you: In that moment, all the mysteries you have given them will return to you, and all the teachings and mysteries they have received will be taken from them.

I have previously spoken to you about such people in a parable, saying: "When you enter a house and are welcomed, say to them: 'Peace be with you.' If they are worthy, let your peace remain with them; if they are not worthy, let your peace return to you." This means: If these people are worthy of the mysteries and genuinely seek God, give them the mysteries of the Light-kingdom. But if they are deceitful and only pretend to be sincere, and you give them the mysteries of the Light-kingdom, and later they betray you and the mysteries, then perform the first mystery of the First Mystery, and it will return all the mysteries you have given them back to you, and it will make them strangers to the mysteries of the Light forever.From now on, such men will not return to the world. Truly, I tell you, their place is in the jaws of the dragon of outer darkness. However, if they repent and renounce the world, all its matters, and its sins completely, and fully submit to the mysteries of the Light, no other mystery can listen to them or forgive their sins except the mystery of the Ineffable, which has mercy on everyone and forgives all their sins.

CHAPTER 108

After Jesus finished speaking to his disciples, Mary worshiped at His feet and kissed them. She said, "My Lord, please be patient with me as I ask you a question and do not be angry with me." Jesus replied, "Ask what you wish, and I will reveal it to you openly." Mary then asked, "My Lord, suppose we have a good and excellent brother who has learned all the mysteries of the Light, and he has a relative or friend who is a sinner or someone who is not a sinner but has died. The good brother is grieving because his relative is suffering in judgment and punishment. What can we do to help remove him from these harsh judgments?"

Jesus answered Mary, "I have spoken about this before, but listen again so you may be perfected in all mysteries and be called 'the perfected in every fullness.'"Now, therefore, all people, whether they are sinners or not, if you wish to save them from judgments and harsh punishments, and want them to be placed in a righteous body that will discover the mysteries of the divine, so they can ascend and inherit the Light-kingdom, then perform the third mystery of the Ineffable and say: "Carry the soul of this person we think of in our hearts, take them out of all the punishments of the rulers, and quickly lead them to the Virgin of Light. Every month, let the Virgin of Light seal them with a higher seal, and let her place them in a righteous and good body, so they can ascend and inherit the Light-kingdom."

"And if you say this, amen, I tell you: All those who serve in the judgments of the rulers will quickly pass that soul from one to another until they bring it before the Virgin of Light. The Virgin of Light will seal it with the sign of the kingdom of the Ineffable, hand it over to her receivers, and the receivers will place it in a righteous body that will find the mysteries of the Light, so it will be good, ascend, and inherit the Light-kingdom. This is what you asked me about."

CHAPTER 109

And Mary answered and said: "Now, my Lord, have you not brought mysteries into the world so that humans...""Is it possible for someone to avoid the death assigned to them by the rulers of Fate—whether by sword, drowning, torture, or any other cruel means—through the mysteries you have introduced, so they can die suddenly without suffering? Many persecute us because of you and your name, hoping to make us reveal the mystery so we can escape our bodies without enduring pain."

The Savior responded to his disciples, "I have discussed this before, but listen again: Not just you, but anyone who completes the first mystery of the First Mystery of the Ineffable, and performs it with all its steps and symbols, will not suffer through the appointed fates. After completing the mystery in all its forms, whenever they invoke the name of that mystery, they will escape the fate set by the rulers. At that moment, they will leave their physical body, and their soul will become a great light, ascending through all regions of the rulers and the Light, until it reaches its kingdom. It won't need to give explanations or apologies in any region, for it is beyond all signs."CHAPTER 110

After Jesus finished speaking, Mary approached, fell at His feet, kissed them, and said, "My Lord, I still have questions. Please reveal the answers to us openly." Jesus replied, "Ask what you wish, and I will reveal it to you clearly."

Mary asked, "My Lord, did you bring mysteries into the world because of poverty and wealth, weakness and strength, and other conditions like sickness and health? If we go to different places and people do not believe us or listen to our words, can we perform these mysteries so they may truly know we speak the words of the God of the universe?"

The Savior responded to Mary in front of the disciples, "Regarding this mystery you are asking about, I have shared it with you before, but I will explain it again:

"Mary, not just you, but anyone who performs the mystery of raising the dead, which heals demons, pains, sicknesses, the blind, the lame, the maimed, the mute, and the deaf, as I have previously given you, that person who receives and performs this mystery, if they ask for anything—be it poverty or wealth, weakness or strength, health, the healing of the body, raising the dead, or curing all ailments and pains—everything they ask for will quickly come to pass."When the Savior had said this, the disciples came forward and cried out together: "O Savior, you have made us extremely excited with the great deeds you tell us about. Our souls are yearning to leave us and come to you because we originate from you. Now, because of these great deeds, our souls are desperate to rise up to your kingdom."

CHAPTER 111

After the disciples had said this, the Savior continued and said to them: "If you go into cities, kingdoms, or countries, first tell them:

'Search constantly and do not stop until you find the mysteries of the Light that will lead you to the Light-kingdom. Warn them to be cautious of errors. Many will come in my name and say: It is I. But it will not be me, and they will lead many astray.'

"Now, to all who come to you, have faith in you, listen to your words, and act in accordance with the mysteries of the Light, give these mysteries and do not hide them. To those worthy of higher mysteries, give them. To those worthy of lower mysteries, give them as well, and do not hide anything from anyone.

"However, do not give the mystery of raising the dead and healing the sick to anyone, nor teach it, because that mystery belongs to the rulers and all its names. For this reason, keep it to yourselves."Do not teach anyone or give instructions until you have spread the faith worldwide. If you enter cities or countries that do not welcome you, do not believe, or listen to your words, you should perform miracles such as raising the dead, healing the lame, the blind, and curing various sicknesses in those areas. By doing these acts, people will believe in you, knowing that you are messengers of the God of the universe, and will trust all your words. This is why I have given you this mystery, to help you establish faith globally."

After the Savior said this, he continued speaking to Mary: "Now, listen, Mary, about the matter you asked me: Who compels a person to sin? Listen carefully:

"When a baby is born, its power, soul, and counterfeit spirit are all weak. They do not sense anything good or evil due to the heavy burden of forgetfulness. The body is also weak. The baby enjoys the pleasures of the world, and its power, soul, and counterfeit spirit each draw from these pleasures. The power absorbs from the power in the pleasures, the soul from the soul in the pleasures, and the counterfeit spirit from the evil in the pleasures and its desires. Meanwhile, the body absorbs the material that does not sense, present in the pleasures. Destiny, however, takes nothing from the pleasures since it is not mixed with them and leaves in the same state it came into the world."Gradually, the power, the soul, and the counterfeit spirit develop, each sensing according to its nature. The power seeks the light above, the soul aims for the region of mixed righteousness, and the counterfeit spirit pursues evil, lusts, and sins. The body, on the other hand, senses nothing unless energized by matter.

Immediately, the three develop their senses based on their nature. The punitive beings assign watchers to follow them and record their sins to determine how they will be judged. The counterfeit spirit creates and senses all sins and evils commanded by the rulers of fate, imposing them on the soul.

The inner power urges the soul to seek the realm of Light and divinity. The counterfeit spirit misleads the soul, forcing it to commit lawless deeds, mischiefs, and sins, continually opposing the soul and making it do evil. It incites the punitive beings to witness all the sins it causes. Whether day or night, it stirs the soul through dreams or worldly desires, making it crave worldly things, fulfilling the rulers' commands against the soul's will.

In essence, Mary, this counterfeit spirit is the soul's enemy, compelling it to commit all sins.The time for that man is completed, and destiny leads him to death through the rulers and their bonds, bound by Fate.

Then, the retributive receivers come and guide the soul out of the body. For three days, they circle around with the soul in all regions, showing it all the aeons of the world. The counterfeiting spirit and destiny follow the soul, while the power returns to the Virgin of Light.

After three days, the retributive receivers take the soul to the Amente of chaos, where they hand it over to those who punish it. The retributive receivers then return to their own regions, following the order of the rulers regarding the souls' journey.

The counterfeiting spirit becomes the soul's receiver, assigned to it and transferring it according to the necessary punishments for its sins, acting with great hostility towards the soul.

When the soul has completed its punishments in chaos for the sins it committed, the counterfeiting spirit leads it out of chaos, transferring it to different regions because of its sins. It guides the soul along the way of the rulers of the middle regions. Upon arrival, the rulers question the soul about the mysteries of destiny. If the soul cannot answer, the rulers question their destiny and punish the soul according to its sins. I will describe the nature of these punishments when the universe expands.When the time for the soul's punishment by the rulers of the middle realm is over, the counterfeit spirit leads the soul out of all the regions of those rulers and brings it before the light of the sun, following the command of the First Man, Yew. The soul is then presented to the judge, the Virgin of Light. She tests the soul, and if she finds it sinful, she stops her light-power within it to help it stand upright and because of its body and senses. The Virgin of Light then seals the soul and hands it over to one of her receivers, who will place it into a body suitable for the sins it committed.

And truly, I tell you: They will not release that soul from the cycle of reincarnation until it has completed its last cycle according to its merits. I will explain to you the types of bodies these souls will inhabit based on their sins when I discuss the expansion of the universe.

---

CHAPTER 112

Jesus continued: "If, on the other hand, the soul has not listened to the counterfeit spirit and has done good, receiving the mysteries of the Light either from the second or even the third space within, then when the time comes for that soul to leave the body, the counterfeit spirit and destiny will follow it on its journey above.Before it rises above, it reveals the secret of breaking the seals and bonds of the counterfeit spirit that the rulers have used to bind it to the soul. Once this secret is revealed, the bonds of the counterfeit spirit are broken, and it stops attaching itself to the soul, freeing it as per the rulers' commands: 'Do not release this soul until it tells you the secret of breaking all the seals binding you to the soul.'

If the soul reveals this secret and the counterfeit spirit stops binding to it, the soul immediately releases its destiny to the rulers in the middle realm and releases the counterfeit spirit to the rulers of Fate in its designated region.

At that moment, the soul transforms into a brilliant stream of light. The retributive receivers, who guided it out of the body, are afraid of its light and fall on their faces. The soul becomes a stream of light with wings of light, penetrating all the regions of the rulers and orders of the Light until it reaches the region of its kingdom, as far as its received mysteries allow.

However, if it is a soul that received mysteries in the outermost space and committed sins after fulfilling those mysteries, and its time to depart the body arrives, the retributive receivers come to lead it out. The destiny and the counterfeit spirit follow that soul.Because the counterfeit spirit is bound to the soul with the seals and bonds of the rulers, the soul that travels with the counterfeit spirit must do the following: It speaks the mystery that breaks all the bonds and seals binding the counterfeit spirit to the soul. When the soul speaks this mystery, the bonds and seals immediately break. As a result, the counterfeit spirit is released and no longer attached to the soul. In that moment, the soul speaks another mystery to restrain the counterfeit spirit and destiny, freeing itself from their influence. However, it does not have power over them; they have power over it.

At that moment, the receivers of the soul, who carry the mysteries it has received, come and rescue the soul from the hands of the retributive receivers. These retributive receivers then return to the work of the rulers, who handle the leading forth of souls.

The receivers who belong to the Light act as wings of light for the soul and provide it with garments of light. They do not lead the soul into chaos, as it is not lawful to do so for souls that have received mysteries. Instead, they guide it to the way of the rulers of the middle. When the soul reaches these rulers, they are filled with great fear and violent fire, appearing with different faces and immense fear.

At this moment, the soul speaks the mystery of their apology. The rulers are exceedingly afraid and fall on their faces, terrified by the mystery and the apology. The soul then surrenders their destiny, saying to them: "Take your destiny!"I will no longer come to your regions from now on. I have become a stranger to you forever, as I am going to the region of my inheritance. When the soul says this, the Light's receivers fly with it on high and lead it into the realms of Fate, where it gives each region its apology and seals. I will explain this when the universe expands. The soul then gives the counterfeit spirit to the rulers, tells them the mystery of the bonds holding it, and says: "Here is your counterfeit spirit! I will no longer come to your region. I have become a stranger to you forever." It gives everyone their seal and apology.

After saying this, the Light's receivers fly with the soul out of the realms of Fate and lead it into all the higher realms, giving each region its apology and seals to the tyrants of the king, Adamas. It provides the apologies of all the rulers of the regions of the Left, whose collective apologies and seals I will share when I explain the universe's expansion.

The receivers then lead the soul to the Virgin of Light. The soul gives the Virgin of Light the seals and the glory of the songs of praise. The Virgin of Light and the seven other virgins of Light examine the soul, finding their signs, seals, baptisms, and chrism within it. The Virgin of Light seals the soul, the Light's receivers baptize it, and each virgin seals it with her seals.

Finally, the Light's receivers hand the soul over to the great Sabaoth, the Good, who is at the gate of Life in the region of the Right, known as 'Father.'And that soul gives him the glory of its songs of praise, its seals, and its apologies. Sabaoth, the Great and Good, seals it with his seals. The soul then shares its knowledge, the glory of its songs of praise, and the seals with everyone in the Right. They all seal it with their seals, and Melchisedec, the great Receiver of the Light in the Right, seals the soul. All Melchisedec’s receivers seal the soul and lead it into the Treasury of the Light. 

It gives the glory, honor, and praise of the songs and all the seals from the regions of the Light. All those in the Treasury of the Light seal it with their seals, and it goes to the region of the Inheritance.

---

CHAPTER 113

After the Saviour had said this to his disciples, he asked them, "Do you understand what I am saying to you?" Mary stepped forward and replied, "Yes, my Lord, I understand your words, and I will comprehend them all. 

Regarding these words you have spoken, my mind has considered four thoughts, and my inner light-man has guided me, eager to come forth and unite with you. Now, my Lord, listen as I share the four thoughts that have arisen in me.

The first thought concerns your words: 'The soul gives the apology and seal to all the rulers in the region of the king, Adamas, and shares the apology, honor, and glory of all their seals and songs of praise with the region of the Light.' You spoke about this before when they brought you the piece of money, and you asked, 'Whose image is this?'"They said, "The king's." When you saw that it was made of silver and copper, you said, "Give the king's to the king and God's to God." This means that if the soul receives mysteries, it offers an apology to all rulers and the region of the king, Adamas. The soul gives honor and glory to those in the region of the Light.

When you saw that it was made of silver and copper, it symbolized that the soul contains the Light's power, like refined silver, and the counterfeit spirit, like material copper. This is the first thought.

The second thought refers to what you told us about the soul that receives the mysteries. If it enters the region of the rulers of the middle way, they meet it with great fear. The soul gives them the mystery of fear, and they are afraid. The soul gives destiny to its region, the counterfeit spirit to its own region, and the apology and seals to each ruler along the way. It gives honor, glory, and praise to those in the region of the Light.

You spoke about this through our brother Paul: "Give tax to whom tax is due, give fear to whom fear is due, give tribute to whom tribute is due, give honor to whom honor is due, and give praise to whom praise is due. Owe nothing to anyone." This means that the soul which receives mysteries gives an apology to all regions. This is the second thought.The third thought, on the other hand, concerns the word you previously spoke to us: "The counterfeiting spirit is hostile to the soul, making it commit all sins and mischiefs, and it transfers the soul to punishment because of these sins. In short, it is hostile to the soul in every way." Regarding this, you said to us before: "The enemies of a man are those in his own house," meaning the counterfeiting spirit and destiny, which reside in the house of the soul and are hostile to it, causing it to commit all sins and wrongdoings. My Lord, this is the third thought.

The fourth thought concerns the word you said: "If the soul leaves the body and travels with the counterfeiting spirit, and it has not found the mystery to undo all the bonds and seals tied to the counterfeiting spirit, so it may stop haunting it—if it hasn't found it, the counterfeiting spirit leads the soul to the Virgin of Light, the judge. The judge, Virgin of Light, examines the soul and finds it has sinned. If the mysteries of the Light are not found with it, she hands it over to one of her receivers, who then casts it into a body, and the soul does not escape the cycle of bodies until it completes its last circuit." Regarding this, my Lord, you previously said to us: "Make peace with your enemy while you are on the way with him, lest your enemy hands you over to the judge, and the judge hands you over to the servant, and the servant casts you into prison. You will not come out until you have paid the last penny."**Chapter 114**

When Jesus heard Mary say these words, he replied: "Well said, blessed Mary, spiritual one. These are the explanations of what I have spoken." Mary responded, "Still, my Lord, I have more questions for you, and from now on, I will ask you everything with confidence. So please be patient with us and explain everything we ask, so my brothers can share it with everyone."

After she said this, Jesus, filled with compassion, answered her: "Truly, I say to you, I will not only answer all your questions, but I will also reveal things you haven't even thought to ask about, things that haven't entered the human heart, and which even the lesser gods do not know."

---

Because this is your word: Every soul that leaves the body and travels with the false spirit, and does not find the mystery of breaking all the seals and bonds to free itself from the false spirit attached to it, that soul which hasn't discovered the mysteries of the Light and detachment from the false spirit, if it hasn’t found them, the false spirit leads the soul to the Virgin of Light. The Virgin of Light, acting as a judge, hands that soul to one of her receivers, who then casts it into the sphere of the aeons. The soul does not escape the cycle of reincarnation until it has completed its appointed rounds. This, my Lord, is the fourth thought.Now, therefore, Mary, ask whatever you wish, and I will reveal it to you directly without using metaphors."

CHAPTER 115

Mary replied, "My Lord, in what way do baptisms forgive sins? I heard you say, 'The retributive servants follow the soul, witnessing all the sins it commits so they can convict it in judgment.' So, my Lord, do the mysteries of baptism erase the sins held by these retributive servants so they forget them? Please, my Lord, explain how baptisms forgive sins; we want to understand it clearly."

The Savior answered, "You have asked well, Mary. The servants indeed witness all sins; they remain in the judgments, capturing souls and convicting sinners who have not received the mysteries. They hold these souls in chaos, punishing them. These retributive receivers cannot move beyond chaos to reach higher orders and convict souls from those regions.

It is not allowed to use force on souls that receive the mysteries and lead them into chaos, where the retributive servants could convict them. The retributive servants only convict souls of sinners who have received no mysteries to guide them out of chaos. However, the souls that receive the mysteries cannot be convicted by these servants because they do not come from the servants' regions. Even if they enter those regions, the servants cannot obstruct or lead them into chaos.

Listen, and I will explain truthfully how the mystery of baptism forgives sins."Now, if souls sin while they are still in the world, retributive spirits come and witness all their sins to ensure they can be judged when they leave the chaos realm. The counterfeiting spirit also witnesses and records all the soul's sins, marking them so that the rulers of punishment can recognize the sinful soul and know how many sins it has committed. This ensures the soul is punished according to its sins.

However, if someone receives the mysteries of baptism, this mystery becomes a powerful, purifying fire. It burns away the sins attached to the soul by the counterfeiting spirit. Once all the sins are cleansed from the soul, the fire enters the body, chases away the spirits secretly, and separates them from the soul and its power. This process divides the counterfeiting spirit, destiny, and body into one portion while the soul and its power are separated into another.Chapter 116

When the Savior had said this, he asked his disciples, "Do you understand the way I am speaking to you?" Then Mary stepped forward and said, "Yes, my Lord, I do. I pay close attention to all your words. You spoke to us about the forgiveness of sins in a metaphor before, saying, 'I have come to bring fire to the earth,' and again, 'What do I want but that it burns?' And again, you clarified it by saying, 'I have a baptism to undergo, and how distressed I am until it is completed! Do you think I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division. From now on, five in one house will be divided, three against two and two against three.' This, my Lord, is what you spoke clearly.

The words you said, 'I have come to bring fire to the earth, and what do I want but that it burns?' mean that you have brought the mysteries of baptism into the world, and you desire that they consume all the sins of the soul and purify them. You clarified it further by saying, 'I have a baptism to undergo, and how distressed I am until it is completed!' This means you will not stay in the world until the baptisms are completed and purify the perfect souls. And also, the words you spoke to us before: 'Do you think I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division.'"From now on, five people in one house will be divided: three against two, and two against three. This means that the mystery of baptisms has brought division into the world, separating the counterfeiting spirit, the body, and destiny into one group, while the soul and power are in another group. Thus, three are against two, and two against three. When Mary said this, the Savior responded, "Well said, spiritual and pure Mary. This is the meaning of the word."

---

CHAPTER 117

Mary spoke again, "My Lord, I still have questions. Please bear with me. We know how baptisms forgive sins. But what about the mysteries of the three spaces, the First Mystery, and the Ineffable? Do they forgive sins like baptisms do?"

The Savior replied, "No, the mysteries of the three spaces forgive the soul for all the sins it has committed in all regions of the rulers, from the beginning of time onwards. They also forgive future sins until the mysteries are no longer effective. I'll explain this when the universe expands.

Additionally, the mysteries of the First Mystery and the Ineffable forgive the soul for all sins and iniquities it has committed. They not only forgive all sins but also ensure that no sin is counted against the soul from this moment onward for all eternity, due to the immense glory of that great mystery."**CHAPTER 118**

After the Savior had spoken, he asked his disciples, "Do you understand what I am saying?" Mary responded, "Yes, my Lord, I understand all your words.

[p. 252]

Regarding what you said about the mysteries of the three spaces forgiving sins and covering the souls' iniquities, David the prophet foretold this, saying, 'Blessed are they whose sins are forgiven and whose iniquities are covered.' And when you spoke about the mystery of the First Mystery and the mystery of the Ineffable forgiving all who receive these mysteries—not only the sins they have committed from the beginning but also not counting them against them from now to eternity—David also prophesied this, saying, 'Blessed are those to whom the Lord God will not count sins.' This means that sins will not be counted against those who have received the mysteries of the First Mystery and the mystery of the Ineffable." The Savior said, "Well said, Mary, you are spiritual and pure in light. This is the explanation of the word." Mary continued, "My Lord, if someone receives the mysteries of the First Mystery, then sins again, but later repents and prays within any of the mysteries, will they be forgiven or not?" The Savior replied, "Truly, I say to you: Anyone who receives the mysteries of the First Mystery, if they sin again but repent and pray within the mystery of the First Mystery, even twelve times, they will be forgiven."

[p. 253]Mary continued and said, "My Lord, if those who have received the mysteries of the First Mystery turn away and sin, and if they die before repenting, will they inherit the kingdom or not, since they have received the gift of the First Mystery?" 

The Saviour replied, "Truly, I tell you, anyone who has received the mysteries of the First Mystery and sins the first, second, and third time, and if they die before repenting, their judgment is harsher than all others. They will dwell in the jaws of the dragon of the outer darkness and eventually be frozen in punishment and perish forever, because they received the gift of the First Mystery but did not remain faithful to it."

Mary responded, "My Lord, if people receive the mysteries of the Ineffable, turn away, sin, lose their faith, and then repent while still alive, how many times will they be forgiven?"The Savior answered Mary, "Truly, I tell you, anyone who receives the mysteries of the Ineffable will be forgiven if they sin, repent, and pray sincerely, no matter how many times they stray and repent again. This is because they have received the compassionate and forgiving gift of the mysteries."

Mary then asked, "Lord, what happens to those who receive the mysteries but lose their faith, sin, and die before they repent?"

The Savior replied, "Truly, I tell you, those who receive the mysteries are blessed. But if they sin and die without repenting, their judgment will be harsher than any other. They will not return to life but will be cast into outer darkness and cease to exist forever."

After saying this, the Savior asked his disciples, "Do you understand what I mean?" Mary responded, "I understand the words you have spoken."Now, therefore, my Lord, this is what you have said: 'Blessed are those souls who receive the mysteries of the Ineffable. But if they turn away, sin, and lose their faith, and die without repenting, they are no longer fit to return to the body or anything else. They are cast out into outer darkness and will perish forever.' You have also told us before, 'Salt is good; but if it becomes useless, how can it be made salty again? It is not even fit for the soil or the manure pile; it is thrown away.' This means: Blessed are all the souls who receive the mysteries of the Ineffable, but if they sin, they are not fit to return to the body or anything else and are cast into outer darkness to perish there."

When she had said this, the Saviour replied, "Well said, pure spiritual light, Mary. This is the meaning of the word." Mary then continued and asked, "My Lord, if people who receive the mysteries of the First Mystery and the Ineffable remain sincere in their faith without hypocrisy, but then sin under the force of Fate and repent and pray again in any of the mysteries, how often will they be forgiven?"And the Savior answered and said to Mary amidst his disciples: "Truly, truly, I say to you: All people who receive the mysteries of the Ineffable and the mysteries of the First Mystery will sin due to the compulsion of fate. If they repent and follow any of their mysteries while they are still alive, their sins will be forgiven because these mysteries are compassionate and forgiving always. That's why I have said before: These mysteries will not only forgive their past sins but also will not hold any future sins against them, provided they repent at any time. 

However, if those who receive the mysteries of the Ineffable and the First Mystery sin and die without repenting, they will be like those who have sinned and not repented. Their place will be in the jaws of the dragon of outer darkness, and they will perish and cease to exist forever. This is why I have said: All people who receive the mysteries should be aware of the time they will leave their body and avoid sinning, so they may inherit the Light-kingdom forever."

When the Savior had said this to his disciples, he asked them: "Do you understand what I am saying?" Mary answered: "Yes, my Lord, I have precisely followed all your words."Regarding this word you spoke to us earlier: "If the homeowner knew at what time the thief was coming to break into the house, he would stay awake and not allow the thief to break in." When Mary said this, the Savior replied: "Well spoken, spiritual Mary. This is the message." The Savior then said to his disciples: "Therefore, tell all who will receive the mysteries in the Light: Watch over yourselves and do not sin, so that you do not accumulate more evil and leave your body without having repented, becoming strangers to the Light-kingdom forever."

After the Savior said this, Mary responded: "My Lord, the compassion of those mysteries that forgive sins at all times is great." The Savior replied to Mary in the presence of the disciples: "If today a worldly king gives gifts to others like him, and forgives murderers and those who commit serious sins deserving of death, if a worldly king can do this, how much more can the Ineffable and the First Mystery, who rule the universe, forgive everyone who receives the mysteries?"

"Or if a king today clothes a soldier in royal garments and sends him to foreign lands, and the soldier commits murders and other serious sins deserving of death, the king's protection will prevent any harm from coming to him because of the royal garments. How much more, then, will those who wear the mysteries of the Ineffable and the First Mystery, who rule over everything above and below, be protected?"### Chapter 122

Jesus saw a woman who came to repent but had been baptized three times without showing any worthy actions. Jesus wanted to test Peter's compassion and forgiveness. He said to Peter, "I have baptized this soul three times, yet she has not done anything worthy of the mysteries of the Light. Why should she continue to be unproductive? Peter, perform the ritual that cuts off souls from the inheritance of the Light, and cut off this woman's soul."

Jesus was testing Peter's compassion. Peter responded, "My Lord, give her one more chance. We can provide her with the higher mysteries, and if she is worthy, she will inherit the Light-kingdom. If not, then you can cut her off."

Jesus recognized Peter's compassion and forgiveness. He then asked his disciples if they understood the lesson from the woman's story. Mary replied, "My Lord, I understand the mysteries related to this woman. You previously told us a parable: 'A man owned a fig tree in his vineyard. He came looking for fruit on it but found none. He said to the gardener, 'For three years I've come looking for fruit on this fig tree and found none. Cut it down; why should it waste the soil?'"Sure, here is the text converted into modern English and simplified:

---

But he responded and said to him: "My lord, please be patient with it for one more year, until I dig around it and fertilize it. If it bears fruit next year, then you can let it be. But if it doesn't produce any fruit, then you can cut it down." Look, my Lord, this is the meaning of the word." The Savior answered and said to Mary: "Well said, spiritual one. This is the meaning of the word."

CHAPTER 123

Mary continued and asked the Savior: "My Lord, if a man has received mysteries and has not acted worthily, but has sinned and then repented deeply, is it lawful for my brethren to renew the mystery for him, or should they give him a lower mystery instead? Is it lawful or not?" The Savior answered and said to Mary: "Truly, I tell you, neither the mystery he received nor the lower mysteries can forgive his sins. It is the higher mysteries that will listen to him and forgive his sins. Therefore, Mary, let your brethren give him the higher mystery, and they should accept his repentance and forgive his sins. The higher mystery will forgive his sins because he has received it again, and because he has risen above the lower mysteries. The lower mysteries cannot forgive his sins, but the higher mystery will."

---

This version maintains the original meaning while using modern language for clarity.If a person has received the three mysteries in either the two spaces or the third space, and they turn away and sin, no mystery will help them repent, except the First Mystery and the mysteries of the Ineffable. These are the only ones that will listen and accept their repentance."

Mary asked, "My Lord, if someone has received mysteries up to the second or third space and has not sinned but remains faithful and sincere, what will happen to them?"

The Savior replied, "Anyone who has received mysteries in the second or third space and has not sinned but remains faithful and sincere can receive mysteries in any space they choose, from the first to the last, because they have not sinned."

CHAPTER 124

Mary asked again, "My Lord, if a person has known the divine and received the mysteries of the Light but then sins and does not repent, and another person has neither found nor known the divine and is a sinner and impious, and both die, who will suffer more in judgment?"

The Savior replied, "Truly, I say to you: The person who has known the divine and received the mysteries of the Light but sinned and did not repent will suffer far more in judgment compared to the impious and law-breaking person who has not known the divine. Therefore, let those who have ears to hear, listen."When the Savior had said this, Mary stepped forward and said, "My Lord, my light-man has ears, and I have understood everything you have spoken. Regarding this, you spoke to us in a parable:

'The servant who knew his master's will and didn't prepare or do his master's will, will receive many blows; but the one who didn't know and didn't do, will deserve fewer blows. For to whom much is given, much will be required,'--that is, my Lord: He who knew the divine and found the mysteries of the Light but disobeyed, will be punished more severely than he who did not know the divine. This, my Lord, is the meaning of your words."

CHAPTER 125

Mary continued and said to the Savior, "My Lord, if the faith and mysteries reveal themselves, and if souls come into the world many times and neglect to receive the mysteries, hoping that they will receive them in another lifetime, won't they be at risk of not succeeding in receiving the mysteries?" 

The Savior answered and said to his disciples, "Tell the whole world: Strive to receive the mysteries of the Light in this time of trial and enter the Light-kingdom. Do not delay from one day to another or from one lifetime to another, hoping you will receive the mysteries in another lifetime."Here is the text converted to modern English, corrected, and simplified without altering its original meaning:

---

These people do not know when the number of perfect souls will be complete. When it is, I will close the gates of Light and no one will be able to enter or leave. The number of perfect souls and the mystery of the First Mystery, for which the universe exists, will be complete. I am that Mystery.

From this moment on, no one will be able to enter the Light or leave. When the number of perfect souls is complete, before I set the world on fire to purify the aeons, veils, firmaments, the earth, and everything on it, humanity will still exist.

At that time, faith and mysteries will be revealed even more. Many souls will return to the world, including some who have listened to my teachings. They will find the mysteries of the Light and come to its gates, only to discover that the number of perfect souls is complete and the First Mystery and the understanding of the universe are finished. They will see that I have shut the gates of the Light, making it impossible for anyone to enter or leave.

These souls will knock on the gates of the Light, saying, "Lord, open for us!" I will respond, "I do not know you or where you come from." They will say, "We have received your mysteries, followed your teachings, and you taught us on the highways." I will reply, "I do not know you. You are evildoers and wrongdoers even now."

---Go into the outer darkness. From that hour, they will be in the outer darkness where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth. Therefore, announce to the whole world: 'Strive to renounce the world and its matters so that you may receive the mysteries of the Light before the number of perfect souls is complete. Otherwise, you may be stopped at the gates of the Light and led into the outer darkness.' 

Now, whoever has ears to hear, let them hear. When the Savior said this, Mary stepped forward and said: "My Lord, not only does my inner being have ears, but my soul has heard and understood all your words. Now, concerning what you said: 'Announce to the people of the world and tell them to strive to receive the mysteries of the Light during this time of affliction so that they may inherit the Light-kingdom... [A CONSIDERABLE GAP IN THE TEXT OCCURS HERE].

CHAPTER 126

Mary continued and asked Jesus: "What is the outer darkness like, or rather, how many regions of punishment are there?" Jesus answered: "The outer darkness is a great dragon, whose tail is in its mouth, surrounding the whole world. There are many regions of punishment within it. There are twelve mighty punishment-dungeons, each with a ruler whose face is different from the others.

The first ruler in the first dungeon has a crocodile's face, with its tail in its mouth. From the dragon's jaws come all ice, dust, cold, and various diseases. This ruler is called by his true name in his region, 'Enchthonin.'"Here is the text converted into modern English:

---

The ruler in the second dungeon has a cat's face. He is called 'Charachar' in his region.

The ruler in the third dungeon has a dog's face. He is called 'Archaroch' in his region.

The ruler in the fourth dungeon has a serpent's face. He is called 'Achrochar' in his region.

The ruler in the fifth dungeon has a black bull's face. He is called 'Marchur' in his region.

The ruler in the sixth dungeon has a wild boar's face. He is called 'Lamchamor' in his region.

The ruler in the seventh dungeon has a bear's face. He is called 'Luchar' by his authentic name in his region.

The ruler in the eighth dungeon has a vulture's face. He is called 'Laraoch' in his region.

The ruler in the ninth dungeon has a basilisk's face. He is called 'Archeoch' in his region.

In the tenth dungeon, there are many rulers, each with seven dragon heads. The one in charge is called 'Xarmaroch' in his region.

In the eleventh dungeon, there are many rulers, each with seven cat heads. The leader is called 'Rochar' in his region.

In the twelfth dungeon, there are a great number of rulers, each with seven dog heads. The leader is called 'Chremaor' in his region.

These rulers of the twelve dungeons are inside the dragon of outer darkness. Each one has a different name every hour and changes their face every hour.And furthermore, each of these dungeons has a door that opens upwards, so the dragon of the outer darkness has twelve dark dungeons, each with an upward-opening door. An angel watches over each door, appointed by Yew, the First Man and overseer of the Light, to ensure the dragon and the rulers of his dungeons cannot rebel.

CHAPTER 127

After the Saviour said this, Mary Magdalene asked: "My Lord, will the souls that are taken to that region enter through these twelve dungeon doors, each according to their deserved judgment?" The Saviour replied: "No soul will enter the dragon through these doors. But the souls of blasphemers, those who follow false doctrines, those who teach false doctrines, those who engage in immoral acts, and those who are impious, atheists, murderers, adulterers, and sorcerers—if they do not repent during their lives and continue in their sins, as well as souls that have completed their appointed cycles without repenting—at their final cycle, these souls will be led from the dragon’s tail into the dungeons of the outer darkness. When these souls are led into the outer darkness through the jaws of his tail, the dragon closes his tail into his mouth, trapping them inside. This is how the souls will be led into the outer darkness."The dragon of the outer darkness has twelve unique names on its doors, one name for each dungeon door. These twelve names are different from each other; however, saying any one of these names is equivalent to saying all of them. I will reveal these names at the expansion of the universe. This is how the outer darkness, or the dragon, is made.

After the Savior said this, Mary asked, "My Lord, are the punishments from that dragon much worse than all other judgments?"

The Savior replied, "Yes, they are far more painful compared to all other judgments. Any souls sent to that region will suffer from extremely cold and icy conditions, as well as intense fire. At the end of the world, when the universe ascends, those souls will be completely destroyed by the violent cold and fire and will cease to exist forever."

Mary said, "Woe to the souls of sinners! My Lord, is the fire in the world of humans fiercer, or the fire in Amente?"

The Savior responded, "Truly, I tell you, the fire in Amente is nine times fiercer than the fire in the human world.

"The fire in the punishments of the great chaos is nine times more intense than that in Amente.

"The fire in the punishments of the rulers on the path to the middle is nine times more intense than the fire in the great chaos.

"The fire in the dragon of the outer darkness and all its punishments is seventy times more intense than the fire in all the punishments and judgments of the rulers on the path to the middle."### CHAPTER 128

When the Savior finished speaking to Mary, she struck her chest, cried out, and wept along with all the disciples, saying, "Woe to sinners, for their punishments are many!" Mary came forward, fell at Jesus's feet, kissed them, and said, "My Lord, please bear with me if I question you, and do not be angry with me for troubling you often. From now on, I will ask you everything with determination."

The Savior responded, "Ask anything you want, and I will reveal it to you plainly without any parables."

Mary asked, "My Lord, if a good man has completed all the mysteries and has a relative who is wicked, committing all kinds of sins and deserving of outer darkness, and has not repented or fulfilled his duties in the cycles of reincarnation, and if this wicked man has done nothing useful, and has died, and we know for sure that he has sinned and deserves outer darkness—what can we do to save him from the punishments of the dragon of outer darkness? How can we help him be reborn into a righteous body that will find the mysteries of the Light-kingdom so that he may be good, ascend, and inherit the Light-kingdom?"The Savior answered Mary: "If a sinner deserves the outer darkness, has sinned without repenting, or has completed their life cycles without repentance, and is led into the outer darkness, you can help them. If you want to move these souls from the outer darkness to a righteous body that can find the mysteries of the Light and inherit the Light-kingdom, then perform the mystery of the Ineffable, which forgives sins at all times. When you finish, say:

"The soul of the person I am thinking of, if it is in the outer darkness or any other punishment, should be removed from it all. If it has completed its life cycles, it should be brought before the Virgin of Light. The Virgin of Light will then seal it with the seal of the Ineffable and place it in a righteous body that can find the mysteries of the Light, so it may ascend and inherit the Light-kingdom. If it has completed its life cycles, the soul should also be brought before the seven virgins of the Light, who oversee baptisms. They will apply the sign of the kingdom of the Ineffable and lead it into the orders of the Light."

This is what you should say when performing the mystery."Truly, I tell you: If you pray for a soul that is trapped in the dragon of outer darkness, the dragon will release that soul. And if the soul is in any of the regions of judgment, truly, I tell you: The receivers of Melchisedec will quickly rescue it, whether the dragon releases it or it is in the judgments of the rulers. In short, the receivers of Melchisedec will rescue it from all regions and bring it to the region of the Midst before the Virgin of Light. The Virgin of Light will examine it and see the sign of the kingdom of the Ineffable on that soul.

If the soul has not yet completed its required cycles in the changes of the soul or body, the Virgin of Light will seal it with an excellent seal and quickly place it into a righteous body during any month. This body will discover the mysteries of the Light, be good, and ascend to the Light-kingdom.

If the soul has completed its required cycles, the Virgin of Light will examine it and will not chastise it, but will hand it over to the seven virgins of the Light. The seven virgins will examine the soul, baptize it with their baptisms, give it the spiritual chrism, and lead it into the Treasury of the Light, placing it in the last order of the Light until all perfect souls ascend. When the time comes to separate the veils of the region of those on the Right, they will cleanse and purify the soul anew and place it in the orders of the first savior in the Treasury of the Light.CHAPTER 129

After the Savior had finished speaking to his disciples, Mary responded to Jesus: "My Lord, I heard you say: 'Anyone who receives the mysteries of the Ineffable or the First Mystery becomes a beam of light and travels through all regions until they reach their destined place.'"

The Savior replied to Mary: "If someone receives the mystery while still alive, and then leaves their body, they become beams of light and travel through all regions until they reach their destined place. 

"But if they are sinners who have not repented and have left their body, and if you perform the mystery of the Ineffable for them to remove their punishments and place them in a righteous body that inherits the Light-kingdom or enters the last order of the Light, they will not be able to travel through the regions because they did not perform the mystery themselves. Instead, the receivers of Melchisedec follow them and lead them to the Virgin of Light. The servants of the judges of the rulers quickly take these souls and pass them from one to another until they are brought before the Virgin of Light."Mary continued and said to the Savior: "My Lord, if a man has received the mysteries of the Light from the outer space, and when the time for those mysteries is complete, he continues to receive deeper mysteries. If this man becomes negligent and does not pray to remove the evil from the food and drink he consumes, and because of this negligence, he sins again after the time for the mysteries has ended. If he dies before repenting and receiving deeper mysteries that can forgive his sins, and we know for certain that he has been taken into the dragon of the outer darkness because of his sins, and he has no helper or compassionate person to perform the mystery of the Ineffable to save him from the dragon and lead him into the Light-kingdom, what will happen to him? Please, Lord, do not abandon him, for he has endured sufferings in persecutions and in his devotion."Now, therefore, O Savior, have mercy on me, so that none of our relatives may be in such a state. Have mercy on all the souls that find themselves in this situation. You are the key that opens and closes the door of the universe, and your mystery encompasses everything. Have mercy, O Lord, on these souls. They have called on the name of your mysteries, even if only for a single day, and have truly believed in them, not just pretended. Give them, O Lord, a gift in your goodness and grant them rest in your mercy."

When Mary said this, the Savior called her most blessed because of her words. The Savior, moved by great compassion, said to Mary: "To all people who are in the situation you described, while they are still alive, give them the mystery of one of the twelve names of the dungeons of the dragon of outer darkness. I will give you these names when I have finished explaining the universe to you, from within and from without."If any person discovers one of the twelve names of the dragon of the outer darkness, and even if they are great sinners who first received the mysteries of the Light but later sinned again or never performed any mysteries, if they complete their life cycles and die without repenting, they will be led into the punishments within the dragon of the outer darkness. If they speak one of the twelve angelic names while enduring these punishments, the dragon will be severely shaken, and the door of their dungeon will open. The ruler of the dungeon will then release their souls because they discovered the dragon's name.

When the ruler releases these souls, the angels of Yew, the First Man, quickly take these souls to Yew, the First Man, the Envoy of the First Commandment. Yew examines the souls and confirms that they have completed their cycles and should not be sent back into the world, as it is forbidden to return souls cast into the outer darkness back into life.If they have not yet completed their cycles of reincarnation, the guardians of Yew keep them until they perform the mystery of the Ineffable. Then, they place them into a good body that will find the mysteries of the Light and inherit the Light-kingdom. 

But if Yew determines that they have completed their cycles and cannot return to the world, and the sign of the Ineffable is not with them, Yew has compassion and leads them before the seven virgins of the Light. The virgins baptize them but do not give them the spiritual anointing. They lead them into the Treasury of the Light but do not place them in the orders of the Inheritance because they lack the sign and seal of the Ineffable. However, they save them from all punishments and place them in the light of the Treasury, isolated and apart until the ascension of the universe. 

At the time when the veils of the Treasury of the Light are drawn apart, these souls are cleansed and purified anew. They are given new mysteries and placed in the last order within the Treasury, ensuring they are saved from all judgments' punishments.

When the Saviour had spoken this, he asked his disciples: "Do you understand how I am speaking to you?"

Mary then responded: "My Lord, this is what you have previously told us in a parable, saying: 'Make friends with the wealth of unrighteousness, so that if you fall short, they may welcome you into everlasting dwellings.' Who then is the wealth of unrighteousness, if not the dragon of the outer darkness?"Here is the modernized and simplified version of the text:

---

This is the message: Whoever understands the secret of one of the names of the dragon of the outer darkness, whether they stay in the outer darkness or have completed the changes, and speaks the name of the dragon, will be saved and lifted out of the darkness into the Treasury of Light. This is the message, my Lord."

The Savior responded to Mary: "Well said, spiritual and pure one. This is the meaning of the message."

Mary continued and asked: "My Lord, does the dragon of the outer darkness come into this world or not?"

The Savior answered: "When the sun's light is above the world, it covers the dragon's darkness. But if the sun is below the world, the dragon's darkness veils the sun, and the darkness enters the world as smoke at night. If the sun withdraws its rays, the world cannot endure the dragon's true darkness; otherwise, it would be destroyed."

After saying this, Mary asked the Savior again: "My Lord, I still have questions. Please do not hide the answers from me. Who compels a person to sin?"

The Savior answered: "It is the rulers of Fate who compel people to sin."

Mary responded: "My Lord, do the rulers come down to the world and force people to sin?"

The Savior replied: "They do not come down in that way to the world."When an old soul is about to descend, the rulers of Fate, who reside in the head region of the aeons (known as the kingdom of Adamas, opposite the Virgin of Light), give the old soul a cup of forgetfulness filled with wicked desires and forgetfulness. Once the soul drinks from this cup, it forgets all the regions it has visited and all the punishments it has endured. This cup forms a body outside the soul, resembling the soul in every way, and is known as the counterfeiting spirit.

If it is a new soul created from the sweat, tears, or breath of the rulers, the five great rulers of Fate take the sweat of all the aeon rulers, mix it, and form it into a soul. Alternatively, if it comes from the refuse of the purification of Light, Melchisedec collects it from the rulers. The five great rulers mix this refuse, divide it, and form it into different souls, ensuring that each aeon ruler contributes a portion to the soul. This joint effort ensures that all rulers partake in the soul's creation. If the soul is made from sweat, the five great rulers handle it, but if it is from the refuse of the purification of Light, Melchisedec, the great Receiver of Light, takes charge.When refuse rises from the rulers, or rather from their tears or breath—in other words, from their souls—these five rulers divide and craft it into different souls. If it’s an old soul, the chief ruler of the aeons mixes the cup of forgetfulness with the seed of wickedness and adds it to each new soul during their formation. This cup of forgetfulness becomes the counterfeiting spirit for that soul, acting as a covering that mimics the soul in every way.

The five great rulers of the aeons, along with the rulers of the sun and moon, breathe into the soul a portion of my power, which the last Helper has added to the Mixture. This power remains within the soul, autonomous and in charge of its purpose, enabling the soul to seek the works of the Light of the Height continuously. This power resembles the soul in every form and cannot exist outside it; it stays within, as I commanded from the start.

When I intended to place it into the first Commandment, I commanded it to stay inside the souls for the purpose of the First Mystery. At the expansion of the universe, I will explain all these matters concerning the power and the soul—how they are fashioned, which rulers create them, and the different types of souls. I will also reveal the names of those who fashion the soul.I will explain to you how the false spirit and destiny are prepared. I will also tell you the soul's name before and after it is purified. I will reveal the name of the false spirit and destiny, as well as the names of all the bonds that rulers use to bind the false spirit to the soul. Furthermore, I will explain the names of all the decans who shape the soul within bodies and how souls are formed.

I'll describe the types of souls, including those of humans, birds, wild animals, and reptiles. I will also reveal the types of all souls and rulers sent into the world, so that you can gain complete knowledge. All of this will be explained at the expansion of the universe. Afterward, I will explain why all of this happens.

Listen as I talk about the soul: The five great rulers of Fate and the rulers of the sun and moon breathe into the soul, giving it a portion of my power. This power remains within the soul, allowing it to exist. The false spirit is placed outside the soul, watching and assigned to it. The rulers bind it to the soul with their seals and bonds, forcing it to commit misdeeds and iniquities, making it their slave. This ensures the soul remains under their control throughout its bodily changes, constantly involved in sin and worldly desires.For this reason, I have introduced these mysteries into the world to break all the bonds and seals tied to the soul by the deceiving spirit. These mysteries free the soul from its rulers and transform it into refined light, guiding it to the kingdom of its Father, the First Issue, the First Mystery, forever.

That's why I said earlier: 'Anyone who does not leave their father and mother and follow me is not worthy of me.' You must leave your earthly parents, who are the rulers, so that I can make you children of the First Mystery forever.

Chapter 132

When the Savior said this, Salome stepped forward and asked, "Lord, if our parents are the rulers, why does the Law of Moses say, 'Anyone who abandons their father and mother must die'? Isn't that what the Law says?"

After Salome spoke, the light-power in Mary Magdalene arose, and she said to the Savior, "Lord, may I speak to my sister Salome to explain the meaning of her words?"

The Savior, hearing Mary, called her exceedingly blessed and said to her, "Mary, I command you to explain the meaning of Salome's words."When the Savior had said this, Mary approached Salome, embraced her, and said: "My sister Salome, regarding the words you spoke, it is written in the Law of Moses: 'He who abandons his father and mother shall be put to death.' However, my sister Salome, this law does not apply to the soul, the body, or the counterfeit spirit, for these are all creations of the rulers. The Law refers to the power that comes from the Savior, the light-man within us. The Law also says that anyone who remains without the Savior and his mysteries will not only die but also face destruction."

After Mary said this, Salome embraced her again and said: "The Savior has the power to make me understand like you."

When the Savior heard Mary's words, he called her exceedingly blessed. The Savior then spoke to Mary in the presence of his disciples: "Listen, Mary, to who compels a man to sin. The rulers bind the counterfeit spirit to the soul so it does not agitate it constantly, making it commit sins and iniquities. They also command the counterfeit spirit: 'If the soul leaves the body, do not agitate it, but transfer it through all the regions of judgment for the sins it has committed so it can be punished in each region. This way, the soul cannot ascend to the Light or return to the body's changes.'"In short, they instruct the counterfeiting spirit: "Do not disturb it at any time unless it does not reveal the mysteries and break all the seals and bonds we have placed on it. If it speaks the mysteries, breaks all the seals and bonds, and acknowledges the region, let it go, for it belongs to the Light of the Height and is no longer connected to us or to you. You will not be able to capture it from this point on. However, if it does not reveal the mysteries or break the seals and bonds, capture it and do not let it go. Transfer it to the punishments and judgment regions for all the sins you have made it commit. Then, bring these souls before the Virgin of Light, who will send them back into the cycle."

The rulers of the great Fate of the aeons hand these souls over to the counterfeiting spirit. They summon the servants of their aeons, numbering 365, and give them the soul and the counterfeiting spirit, which are bound together. The counterfeiting spirit is the outer part of the soul, and the compound power is the inner part of the soul, within both, enabling them to stand upright. The rulers instruct the servants: "This is the form you are to place into the material world body." They say, "Place the compound power, the inner part of the soul, inside them all so they can stand upright, for it is their support. After the soul, place the counterfeiting spirit."

Thus, they direct their servants to place the soul and the counterfeiting spirit into the bodies of the antitype.In this manner, the servants of the rulers bring the power, the soul, and the counterfeit spirit down to the world and release them into the realm of the rulers of the middle. These middle rulers take care of the counterfeit spirit, while Destiny, known as Moira, guides a person until their death, as determined by the great rulers of Fate who have bound the soul. The servants of the sphere bind the soul, the power, the counterfeit spirit, and Destiny. They divide them into two parts and search for the man and the woman in the world who bear their signs, so they can send these parts into them. One part is given to the man and the other to the woman, through food, air, water, or something they drink.

"I will explain to you the nature of every soul and how they enter the bodies of men, birds, cattle, wild beasts, reptiles, and other creatures in the world. I will describe how they enter human bodies during the expansion of the universe.

"When the servants of the rulers place one part into the woman and the other into the man as I've described, they secretly influence them, even if they are far apart, to come together in the world. The counterfeit spirit in the man connects with the part given to the world within his body and sends it into the woman's womb, where it joins with the part given to the seed of wickedness. At that moment, the 365 servants of the rulers enter her womb and reside there."The servants bring the two portions together. Additionally, they keep the blood from all the woman's food and drink in her womb for up to forty days. After forty days, they mix this blood thoroughly in the woman's womb. Then they spend another thirty days forming the body's parts to resemble a man's body, with each servant building a different part. I will tell you which spirits are responsible for building the body at the expansion of the universe.

Once the servants complete the entire body and all its parts in seventy days, they call the counterfeit spirit into the body first, then the soul, and finally the compound of power into the soul. The destiny remains outside, following and accompanying them, as it is not blended with them.

After this, the servants seal everything with the seals given by the rulers. They also seal the day the spirit took residence in the woman's womb on the left hand.They mark the day they finish making the body on the right hand. They mark the day the rulers hand it over on the middle of the skull. They mark the day the soul leaves the rulers on the left side of the skull. They mark the day they shape and separate the body parts for the soul on the right side of the skull. They mark the day they attach the counterfeiting spirit to the soul on the back of the skull. They mark the day the rulers breathe life into the body on the brain in the middle of the head and also inside the heart. They mark the number of years the soul will spend in the body on the forehead. They place all these marks on the body. I will tell you the names of all these marks when the universe expands, and afterward, I will explain why everything happened. If you understand, I am that mystery. Now, the servants complete the whole person with all these marks.The servants carry the unique characteristics and bring them to the retributive rulers in charge of all the punishments. These rulers then give the characteristics to their receivers, who are responsible for guiding souls out of their bodies. They provide the seals' specifics so the receivers know when to extract the souls and when to bring about the birth of a body. This allows the servants to follow the soul and keep track of all the sins it commits, along with the counterfeiting spirit, to determine how it should be punished in judgment.

Once the servants have given the seals' details to the retributive rulers, they return to their assigned duties as determined by the rulers of Fate. When the baby's gestation period is complete, the baby is born. The baby's power, soul, and counterfeiting spirit are all small, but its destiny is significant and not integrated into the body. The destiny follows the soul, body, and counterfeiting spirit until the soul exits the body, determining the manner of death as decided by the rulers of Fate.

If a person is destined to die by a wild animal, destiny leads the animal to kill them. If by a snake, falling into a pit, hanging, drowning, or another type of death, destiny enforces that death. This is the sole function of destiny.And destiny follows every person until the day they die.

Mary asked, "For everyone in the world, will everything appointed to them by Fate—whether good or bad, sin or death, or life—come to pass?"

The Savior answered, "Truly, I say to you: Everything appointed to each person by Fate—whether it is all good or all sins—will come to them. This is why I brought the keys of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven; otherwise, no one in the world would be saved. Without these mysteries, no one can enter the Light-kingdom, whether they are righteous or sinners.

"For this reason, I brought the keys of the mysteries into the world, to free sinners who have faith in me and listen to me. I want to free them from the bonds and seals of the rulers and bind them to the seals, vestures, and orders of the Light. Those I free in the world from the bonds and seals of the rulers will also be freed in the spiritual realm. Those I bind in the world to the seals, vestures, and orders of the Light will also be bound to the inheritances of the Light in the spiritual realm.

"For the sake of sinners, I have come at this time to bring them the mysteries, to free them from the rulers and bind them to the inheritances of the Light. This applies not only to sinners but also to the righteous, so I can give them the mysteries, allowing them to enter the Light. Without these mysteries, they cannot enter the Light."For this reason, I haven't kept it hidden; instead, I've clearly proclaimed it. I haven't excluded sinners, but I've announced it to everyone—sinners and righteous alike—saying: "Seek and you will find, knock and it will be opened to you; for everyone who genuinely seeks will find, and to those who knock, the door will be opened." I've told everyone to seek the mysteries of the Light-kingdom, which will purify and refine them, leading them into the Light.

This is why John the Baptist prophesied about me, saying: "I have baptized you with water for repentance and forgiveness of sins. The one who comes after me is stronger than I am. He will separate the wheat from the chaff; the chaff will be burned with unquenchable fire, but the wheat will be gathered into his barn." John's prophecy about me foretold that I would bring the mysteries into the world, purify the sins of those who believe in me, and lead them into the Light.

CHAPTER 134

After Jesus said this, Mary asked, "Lord, if people seek but encounter false teachings, how will they know if they are from you?" Jesus replied, "I have told you before: 'Be as skilled money-changers. Keep the good and reject the bad.' So tell everyone who seeks the divine: 'If the north wind comes, you know there will be cold; if the south wind comes, you know there will be burning heat.'"Now, therefore, tell them: 'If you understand the workings of the heavens and the earth from the winds, then you should know if anyone comes to you and proclaims a god. Check if their words match and fit with everything I have spoken to you through multiple witnesses, and if they align with the arrangement of the air, heavens, stars, and the entire earth and its waters.' Tell them: 'Those who come to you and whose words fit and harmonize with the knowledge I have given you, I will accept as belonging to us.' This is what you should say to people to protect them from false teachings.

"Now, therefore, for the sake of sinners, I have come into the world to save them. Even the righteous, who have never done any evil and have not sinned, need to find the mysteries in the Books of Yew, which I had Enoch write in Paradise, discussing them with him from the tree of Knowledge and the tree of Life. I had him place these books in the rock Ararad and appointed the ruler Kalapatauroth, who oversees Skemmut, to watch over the Books of Yew to protect them from the flood and prevent any rulers from destroying them out of envy. I will give these to you once I explain the expansion of the universe." After the Saviour said this, Mary asked: "My Lord, who in the world has never sinned and is completely pure? If someone is pure in one way, they might not be pure in another. How can they then find the mysteries in the Books of Yew?""I say this: No man in this world can be completely free of sins. If he is free of one sin, he will not be free of another." The Saviour responded to Mary: "I tell you, out of a thousand people, only one, and out of ten thousand, only two, will achieve the mystery of the First Mystery. I will explain this further when I talk about the expansion of the universe. This is why I have come and brought the mysteries to the world, because everyone is sinful and needs the gift of the mysteries."

CHAPTER 135

Mary asked the Saviour: "My Lord, before you came to the world, had any soul entered into the Light?" The Saviour replied: "Truly, I say to you, before I came to the world, no soul had entered into the Light. Now that I am here, I have opened the gates of the Light and the paths leading to it. Therefore, let those who are worthy of the mysteries receive them and enter into the Light." Mary continued: "But Lord, I heard that the prophets have entered into the Light." The Saviour answered: "Truly, I say to you, no prophet has entered into the Light. The rulers of the aeons have only communicated with them and given them the mystery of the aeons. When I came to the aeons, I transformed Elias and sent him into the body of John the Baptist, and I have also transformed others into righteous bodies. These will find the mysteries of the Light, ascend, and inherit the Light-kingdom."To Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, I have forgiven all their sins and given them the mysteries of the Light in the aeons. I have placed them in the region of Yabraoth and with all the rulers who have repented. When I ascend to the Height and enter the Light, I will take their souls with me. But, Mary, I tell you truly: they will not enter the Light before I take your soul and those of all your brethren into the Light.

The rest of the patriarchs and the righteous from Adam's time until now, who are in the aeons and all the orders of rulers, I have transformed through the Virgin of Light into bodies that will all be righteous. These bodies will find the mysteries of the Light, enter, and inherit the Light-kingdom.

Mary said: "We are blessed above all men because of these wonders you have shown us." The Saviour replied to Mary and all the disciples: "I will continue to reveal to you all the wonders of the Height, from the innermost to the outermost. You will be perfected in all knowledge, in fullness, in the highest heights, and the deepest depths."

Mary responded: "Lord, we have clearly understood that you have brought the keys of the mysteries of the Light-kingdom, which forgive sins, purify souls, transform them into refined light, and lead them into the Light."

A PORTION OF THE BOOKS OF THE SAVIOUR

Pistis Sophia, by G.R.S. Mead, [1921], at sacred-texts.com

CHAPTER 136.When Jesus our Lord was crucified and resurrected on the third day, his disciples gathered around him, worshiped him, and said, "Lord, have mercy on us. We left our families and the whole world to follow you." At that time, Jesus stood with his disciples on the ocean and prayed, saying, "Hear me, my Father, father of all fathers, boundless Light: aeeiouo iao aoi oia psinother thernops nopsither zagoure pagoure nethmomaoth nepsiomaoth marachachtha thobarrabau tharnachachan zorokothora ieou sabaoth."

While Jesus prayed, Thomas, Andrew, James, and Simon the Canaanite faced east from the west, and Philip and Bartholomew faced north from the south. The rest of the disciples and the women disciples stood behind Jesus, who was at the altar. Jesus prayed, turning to the four corners of the world with his disciples, all wearing linen garments, and saying, "iao iao iao." This means: iota, because the universe has come forth; alpha, because it will return; omega, because everything will be completed.

After saying this, Jesus said, "iaphtha iaphtha mounaer mounaer ermanouer ermanouer." This means: "O father of all fathers of the boundless spaces, hear me for my disciples, so they may believe in all your words of truth, and grant all I ask; for I know the name of the father of the Treasury of the Light." Jesus, also known as Aberamentho, prayed again, speaking the name of the father of the Treasury of the Light, and said, "Let all the mysteries of the rulers, authorities, angels, archangels, and all powers..."All things from the invisible god Agrammachamarei and Barbelo approached the Leech [Bdella] on one side and moved to the right. At that moment, all the heavens moved to the west, and all the aeons, the sphere, their rulers, and all their powers flew to the west, to the left of the sun and moon. The sun appeared as a great dragon with its tail in its mouth, stretching to seven powers of the Left, drawn by four white horse-like powers. The base of the moon looked like a ship steered by a male and female dragon, drawn by two white bulls. A figure of a baby was on the back of the moon, guiding the dragons that stole light from the rulers. The front of the moon had a cat's face.

The entire world, along with the mountains and seas, moved to the west on the left. Jesus and his disciples remained in the middle, in an airy region below the sphere. They arrived at the first order of the middle way. Jesus stood in the air of this region with his disciples. The disciples asked Jesus, "What is this region we are in?" Jesus replied, "These are the regions of the middle way. When the rulers of Adamas rebelled and continually engaged in procreation, creating rulers, archangels, angels, servitors, and decans, Yew, the father of my father, came from the Right and bound them to a Fate-sphere. There are twelve aeons; six are ruled by Sabaoth, the Adamas, and the other six by his brother Yabraoth. At that time, Yabraoth and his rulers believed in the mysteries of the Light, practiced them, and abandoned the practice of procreation. But Sabaoth, the Adamas, and his rulers continued in the practice of procreation."When Yew, my grandfather, saw that Yabraoth had faith, he took Yabraoth and the other faithful rulers out of their sphere and brought them into a purified air in the light of the sun, between the regions of the middle and the invisible god. He placed them there with the rulers who believed in him.

However, he took Sabaoth, the Adamas, and his rulers, who were not active in the mysteries of the Light but were focused on the mysteries of congress, and bound them within their sphere. He bound eighteen hundred rulers in each aeon and set three hundred and sixty rulers over them. He also appointed five great rulers to oversee the three hundred and sixty and all the bound rulers. These five are known as Kronos, Ares, Hermes, Aphrodite, and Zeus in the world of mankind.

CHAPTER 137

Jesus continued: "Listen, and I will explain their mystery. When Yew had bound them, he drew a power from the great Invisible and bound it to Kronos. He took another power from Ipsantachounchainchoucheoch, one of the three triple-powered gods, and bound it to Ares. He drew a power from Chainchoooch, another of the triple-powered gods, and bound it to Hermes. Then, he drew a power from Pistis Sophia, daughter of Barbelo, and bound it to Aphrodite.

He realized they needed a leader to guide the world and the aeons of the sphere so they wouldn't destroy it in their wickedness. So he went to the Midst, drew a power from the little Sabaoth, the Good, and bound it to Zeus, a good regent, to guide them with his goodness."---

He established a system where he would spend thirteen months in each cycle, freeing the rulers he encountered from their wickedness. He was given two realms opposite those of Hermes to live in.

"I have told you the names of these five great rulers as commonly known. Now, I will tell you their true names: Orimouth corresponds to Kronos, Mounichounaphor to Ares, Tarpetanouph to Hermes, Chosi to Aphrodite, and Chonbal to Zeus. These are their true names."

CHAPTER 138

When the disciples heard this, they bowed down, worshiped Jesus, and said, "We are blessed beyond all men because you have revealed these great wonders to us." They continued and asked him, "Please tell us more about these ways."

Mary approached him, bowed at his feet, kissed his hands, and said, "Yes, my Lord, please tell us the purpose of the ways of the midst. We have heard from you that they are associated with great punishments. How can we escape them? How do they capture souls, and how long do these punishments last? Have mercy on us, our Lord and Savior, so that the enforcers of these judgments do not take our souls and judge us harshly. We want to inherit the Light of your Father and not be wretched and deprived of you."

---When Mary said this, crying, Jesus responded with great compassion, saying, "Truly, my brothers and beloved ones, who have left your families for my sake, I will give all mysteries and knowledge to you. I will reveal the mystery of the twelve aeons of the rulers, their seals, their codes, and how to invoke them to reach their regions. 

"I will also give you the mystery of the thirteenth aeon, how to invoke it, and its codes and seals. Additionally, I will give you the mystery of the baptism of those in the Midst, how to invoke them, and their codes and seals. 

"I will reveal the baptism of those on the Right, our region, along with its codes, seals, and how to invoke it. Furthermore, I will give you the great mystery of the Treasury of the Light and how to invoke it to reach there. 

"I will share all mysteries and knowledge with you so that you may be called 'children of completeness,' perfected in all knowledge and mysteries. You are blessed more than all people on earth because the children of the Light have come in your time."

CHAPTER 139

Jesus continued speaking: "It happened later that the father of my father, Yew, came and took 360 rulers from the rulers of Adamas who did not believe in the mystery of the Light. He bound them in these aerial regions, below the sphere where we are now. He placed five great rulers over them, those who are on the path of the Midst."The first ruler of the middle way is called Paraplex, a ruler with a woman's form whose hair reaches down to her feet. Under her authority are twenty-five archdemons who rule over many other demons. These demons enter into people, seducing them, causing rage, cursing, and slander. They also capture souls and send them through dark smoke and harsh punishments.

Mary said, "I might seem impolite to question you. Please don't be angry if I ask about everything." Jesus replied, "Ask whatever you want." Mary asked, "My Lord, explain how they take souls so that my brothers can understand."

Jesus, also known as Aberamentho, said, "The father of my father, Yew, oversees all rulers, gods, and powers that emerged from the Light of the Treasury. Zorokothora Melchisedec is the messenger to all purified lights within the rulers, leading them into the Treasury of the Light. These two are the great Lights. Their task is to go to the rulers and purify them, with Zorokothora Melchisedec taking the purified lights into the Treasury of the Light. 

When the time comes for their task, they go to the rulers and purify them. Once they finish and return to the regions of the Treasury of the Light, if they reach the regions of the Midst, Zorokothora Melchisedec takes the lights to the gate of the Midst and then into the Treasury of the Light, while Yew returns to the regions of the Right.Until the time arrives for them to reappear, the rulers rebel due to their wickedness and go directly to the lights. Yew and Melchisedec are not with them at that time, and the rulers seize and destroy any souls they can capture using their dark smoke and evil fire.

During this period, an authority named Paraplex, along with her demons, captures the souls of the violently passionate, cursers, and slanderers. She torments and destroys them with dark smoke and evil fire, causing their undoing and dissolution. These souls endure torment in her regions for 133 years and 9 months.

After this period, when the sphere turns and the small Sabaoth, Zeus, reaches the first aeon of the sphere, known in the world as the Ram of Boubastis (Aphrodite), and when Boubastis reaches the seventh house of the sphere, known as the Balance, the veils between those on the Right and those on the Left are drawn aside. The great Sabaoth, the Good, looks down from above, causing alarm throughout the world and the entire sphere before he even looks forth. He gazes upon Paraplex's regions, leading to their dissolution and destruction. All the souls in her torments are then carried back up into the sphere because they have been ruined by Paraplex's punishments.### Chapter 140

He continued his discourse and said: 

"The second order is called Ariouth the Ethiopian, a female ruler who is completely black. Under her are fourteen other archdemons that control many other demons. These demons under Ariouth the Ethiopian enter into conflict-seekers, inciting wars and murders. They harden hearts and provoke anger to cause murders.

"The souls taken by this authority endure torment in her regions for one hundred and thirteen years, suffering from her dark smoke and wicked fire, nearly leading to their destruction. 

"Then, when the sphere turns, and little Sabaoth the Good (known in the world as Zeus) comes to the fourth aeon of the sphere, which is the Crab, and Boubastis (known in the world as Aphrodite) comes into the tenth aeon of the sphere, which is the Goat, the veils between those of the Left and those of the Right draw aside. Yew looks to the right, causing the whole world and all the aeons of the sphere to become alarmed and agitated. He looks upon the dwellings of Ariouth the Ethiopian, leading to the dissolution and ruin of her regions. All the souls under her torment are carried off and cast back into the sphere because they are ruined by her dark smoke and wicked fire."

He continued further in his discourse and said: 

"The third order is called Triple-faced Hekate, under whom there are twenty-seven archdemons. These demons enter into people, leading them to commit perjury, lie, and covet what does not belong to them."The souls that Hekate captures and hands over to her demons are tormented with dark smoke and wicked fire, suffering greatly. They endure 105 years and six months of punishment before they start to dissolve and be destroyed. 

When the celestial sphere turns and Sabaoth the Good (known as Zeus in the world) reaches the eighth aeon called the Scorpion, and when Boubastis (known as Aphrodite) reaches the second aeon called the Bull, the veils between the realms of the Right and Left are drawn aside. Zorokothora Melchisedec looks down from above, causing the world and mountains to tremble and the aeons to become alarmed. He looks upon Hekate's regions, causing them and the souls being punished there to dissolve and be destroyed. These souls are then cast back into the sphere, having been burned in the fire of their punishment.

The fourth order is ruled by Parhedron Typhon, a powerful leader with 32 demons under his command. These demons enter people and seduce them into lust, fornication, adultery, and constant sexual activity. The souls captured by Parhedron Typhon endure 128 years of torment in his realm, suffering from dark smoke and wicked fire until they begin to be ruined and destroyed.When the sphere turns, and Sabaoth the Good, who is also called Zeus, comes to the ninth aeon of the sphere known as the Archer, and when Boubastis, also called Aphrodite, comes to the third aeon known as the Twins, the veils between those on the Left and those on the Right open. Then Zarazaz, called "Maskelli" by the rulers, looks upon the dwellings of Parhedron Typhon, causing his regions to be destroyed. The souls in his punishments are thrown back into the sphere, tormented by his dark smoke and wicked fire.

Continuing his discourse, he said to his disciples: "The fifth order, ruled by Yachthanabas, has many demons under him. These demons enter people, causing them to show favoritism, treat the just unjustly, favor sinners, accept bribes, and neglect the poor and needy. They increase forgetfulness and focus on meaningless things, preventing people from thinking about their lives. When these people die, their souls are taken by Yachthanabas and punished for one hundred and fifty years and eight months, suffering greatly from his dark smoke and wicked fire."When the sphere turns, and the Good, known in the world as Zeus, arrives at the eleventh aeon of the sphere, called the Water-man, and when Boubastis reaches the fifth aeon of the sphere, called the Lion, the veils between those on the Left and those on the Right part. The great Iao, the Good, looks down from above on the regions of Yachthanabas, causing those regions to be dissolved and destroyed. All the souls undergoing punishment there are taken and cast back into the sphere because they are ruined in their chastisements. These are the workings of the ways of the middle that you asked me about.

Chapter 141

When the disciples heard this, they fell down, worshipped him, and said, "Help us now, Lord, and have mercy on us so that we may be spared from these terrible punishments prepared for sinners. Woe to them, woe to the children of men! They wander like the blind in the dark and cannot see. Have mercy on us, Lord, in this great blindness that we are in. Have mercy on all humanity, for the rulers have laid traps for their souls, like lions for their prey, making them ready for punishment because of their ignorance. Have mercy on us, our Lord and Savior, have mercy and save us from this great confusion."

Jesus said to his disciples, "Be comforted and do not be afraid, for you are blessed. I will make you rulers over all these and put them under your authority. Remember, I told you before I was crucified: 'I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven.' Now, I say to you: I will give them to you."When Jesus finished speaking, he sang a song of praise in the great name. The regions of the middle paths hid themselves, and Jesus and his disciples were surrounded by an extremely bright light. Jesus said to his disciples, "Come closer to me." They did so. He then turned towards the four corners of the world, spoke the great name over their heads, blessed them, and breathed into their eyes. Jesus said to them, "Look up and see what you can see." They looked up and saw a great, extremely powerful light, which no one in the world can describe. He said to them again, "Look away from the light and see what you can see." They replied, "We see fire, water, wine, and blood." Jesus, also known as Aberamentho, said to his disciples, "Truly, I tell you: I brought nothing into the world when I came, except this fire, this water, this wine, and this blood. I brought the water and the fire from the region of the Light of lights in the Treasury of the Light, and I brought the wine and the blood from the region of Barbelo. And after a little while, my father sent me the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove.

"The fire, the water, and the wine are for purifying all the sins of the world. The blood, however, was a sign for me because of the human body I received in the region of Barbelo, the great power of the invisible God. The breath, on the other hand, advances towards all souls and leads them to the region of the Light.

"For this reason, I said to you: 'I have come to cast fire on the earth,' meaning I have come to purify the sins of the whole world with fire. And for this reason, I said to the Samaritan woman: 'If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you: Give me a drink, you would ask, and he would give you living water, and there would be in you a spring welling up to everlasting life.'"And for this reason, I took a cup of wine, blessed it, and gave it to you, saying: 'This is the blood of the covenant, which will be poured out for the forgiveness of your sins.' And for this reason, they also pierced my side with a spear, and water and blood flowed out. These are the mysteries of the Light that forgive sins; these are the names and the meanings of the Light."

After this, Jesus commanded: "Let all the powers of the Left go to their regions." Jesus and his disciples stayed on the Mount of Galilee. The disciples asked him: "How long will it be until our sins and wrongdoings are forgiven, and we are made worthy of the kingdom of your father?" Jesus replied: "Truly, I say to you: Not only will I cleanse your sins, but I will also make you worthy of the kingdom of my father. I will give you the mystery of the forgiveness of sins so that whoever you forgive on earth will be forgiven in heaven, and whoever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. I will give you the mystery of the kingdom of heaven so that you can perform these mysteries for others."

Chapter 142

Jesus said to them: "Bring me fire and vine branches." They brought them to him. He prepared the offering and set two wine vessels, one on the right and the other on the left of the offering. He arranged the offering before them, placed a cup of water before the wine vessel on the right, and a cup of wine before the wine vessel on the left. He then placed loaves according to the number of disciples in the middle between the cups and set a cup of water behind the loaves.Jesus stood before the offering, with the disciples behind him, all dressed in linen garments. They held the symbol of the name of the father of the Treasury of the Light in their hands. He prayed, saying:

"Hear me, O Father, father of all fathers, boundless Light: iao iouo iao aoi oia psinother theropsin opsither nephthomaoth nephiomaoth marachachtha marmarachtha ieana menaman amanei (of heaven) israi amen amen soubaibai appaap amen amen deraarai (behind) amen amen sasarsartou amen amen koukiamin miai amen amen iai iai touap amen amen amen main mari marie marei amen amen amen.

"Hear me, O Father, father of all fathers. I invoke you, forgivers of sins and purifiers of iniquities. Forgive the sins of the souls of these disciples who have followed me and purify their iniquities. Make them worthy to be counted in the kingdom of my father, the father of the Treasury of the Light, for they have followed me and kept my commandments. 

"Now, therefore, O Father, father of all fathers, let the forgivers of sins come, whose names are these: siphirepsnichieu zenei berimou sochabricher euthari na nai (have mercy upon me) dieisbalmerich meunipos chirie entair mouthiour smour peucher oouschous minionor isochobortha. 

"Hear me, as I invoke you. Forgive the sins of these souls and erase their iniquities. Let them be worthy to be counted in the kingdom of my father, the father of the Treasury of the Light. 

"I know your great powers and invoke them: auer bebro athroni e oureph e one souphen knitousochreoph mauonbi mneuor souoni chocheteoph choche eteoph memoch anemph. 

"Forgive the sins of these souls and erase their iniquities, which they have knowingly and unknowingly committed, including sins of fornication and adultery up to this day. Forgive them and make them worthy to be counted in the kingdom of my father, so that they are worthy to receive this offering, holy Father."If you, Father, have heard me and forgiven the sins of these souls and erased their wrongdoings, and made them worthy to be counted in your kingdom, please give me a sign in this offering." And the sign that Jesus requested happened. Jesus said to his disciples: "Rejoice and be glad, for your sins are forgiven and your wrongdoings erased, and you are counted in the kingdom of my Father." When he said this, the disciples were filled with great joy. Jesus said to them: "This is the way and the mystery you should perform for those who have faith in you, who are honest and listen to you in all good words. Their sins and wrongdoings will be erased up to the day you perform this mystery for them. But keep this mystery hidden and do not give it to everyone, only to those who follow all the things I have told you in my commandments.

"This is the true mystery of the baptism for those whose sins are forgiven and whose wrongdoings are erased. This is the baptism of the first offering, which shows the way to the region of Truth and the region of Light."

CHAPTER 143

Afterwards, his disciples said to him: "Teacher, reveal to us the mystery of the Light of your Father, since we heard you say: 'There is still a fire-baptism and a baptism of the Holy Spirit of the Light, and there is a spiritual anointing; these lead souls into the Treasury of the Light.' Tell us, therefore, their mystery, so that we may inherit the kingdom of your Father."Jesus said to them: "There is no mystery greater than these mysteries you are asking about, because they will guide your souls into the Light of lights, into the realms of Truth and Goodness, and into the region of the Holy of holies. In that place, there is neither male nor female, nor any forms, but an eternal, indescribable Light. Nothing is greater than these mysteries, except for the mystery of the seven Voices and their forty-nine powers and their symbols. And there is no name more powerful than all of them, the name that contains all names, all lights, and all powers.

"Whoever knows that name, if they leave the body of matter, no smoke, darkness, authority, ruler of Fate, angel, archangel, or power can hold down the soul that knows that name. If they speak that name to fire, it is extinguished, and the darkness retreats.

"And if they say it to demons and the guardians of the outer darkness and their rulers, authorities, and powers, they will all collapse, their flames will burn, and they will cry out: 'Holy, holy are you, most holy of all holies.'

"And if someone speaks that name to the guardians of wicked punishments, their authorities, and all their powers, as well as to Barbelo, the invisible god, and the three triple-powered gods, immediately in those regions, they will all fall, be undone and destroyed, and cry out: 'O Light of all lights, which is in the boundless lights, remember us and purify us.'"

When Jesus finished saying these words, all his disciples cried out and wept loudly, saying... [missing text].

A SIXTH BOOK

Chapter 144

..."And lead them to the rivers and seas of fire, where they take vengeance on it for another six months and eight days. After that, they take it along the middle path, where every ruler of this path punishes it for another six months and eight days. Then, they bring it to the Virgin of Light, who judges good and evil, so she can judge it. When the sphere turns, she hands it over to her receivers, who cast it into the corners of the sphere. The servants of the sphere take it to a water beneath the sphere, which becomes a boiling fire and consumes it until it is completely purified.

Then comes Yaluham, the receiver of Sabaoth, the Adamas, who gives the souls the cup of forgetfulness. He brings a cup filled with the water of forgetfulness and gives it to the soul, which drinks it and forgets all places it has been. They then cast it down into a body that will live a troubled life. This is the punishment for the one who curses."

Mary continued and asked: "My Lord, what happens to a man who persistently slanders when he leaves the body? What is his punishment?"

Jesus replied: "A man who persistently slanders, when his time in the sphere is complete and he leaves the body, is met by Abiout and Charmon, the receivers of Ariel. They lead his soul out of the body and spend three days instructing it about the creatures of the world.

After that, they take it down to Ameute before Ariel, where it is punished for eleven months and twenty-one days. Then they lead it into chaos before Yaldabaoth and his forty-nine demons, where each demon scourges it with fiery whips for another eleven months and twenty-one days. After that…"They lead it into rivers and seas of fire, where it suffers for eleven months and twenty-one days. Then, they take it to the middle path, where each ruler punishes it for another eleven months and twenty-one days. After that, they bring it to the Virgin of Light, who judges the righteous and the sinners. She hands it over to her receivers, who cast it into the realms of the sphere. The servants of the sphere lead it to a water below the sphere, which becomes searing fire and purifies it completely.

Yaluham, the receiver of Sabaoth, the Adamas, gives the soul the cup of forgetfulness. It drinks and forgets all regions and experiences it has gone through. Then, they place it into a body that will endure suffering. This is the punishment for the slanderer.

CHAPTER 145

Mary said: "Woe to sinners!" Salome asked: "My Lord Jesus, what happens to a murderer who has committed no sin other than murder when he dies?" Jesus responded: "A murderer who has committed no other sin, when his time is up and he dies, the receivers of Yaldabaoth come and take his soul, tying it by its feet to a great demon with a horse's face. He spends three days circling the world with this demon. After that, they take him to regions of cold and snow, where he is punished for three years and six months."Here’s a modern English version of the text, simplified and corrected while preserving the original meaning:

---

They then lead it into chaos before Yaldabaoth and his forty-nine demons, and each of his demons punishes it for another three years and six months. After that, they bring it before Persephone, where it is punished by her for another three years and six months. Then, they take it to the way of the midst, where each ruler of that path punishes it for another three years and six months. Finally, they present it to the Virgin of Light, who judges the righteous and the sinners. She decides its fate, and when the sphere turns, she orders it to be cast into outer darkness until the darkness of the midst is lifted. The soul will then be destroyed and dissolved. This is the punishment for a murderer.

CHAPTER 146

Peter said: "My Lord, let the women stop asking questions so that we may also ask." Jesus said to Mary and the women: "Allow the men to ask their questions too." Peter then asked: "My Lord, what is the punishment for a persistent robber and thief when he dies?"

Jesus replied: "When the time of such a person is complete, the receivers of Adonis come for him. They take his soul out of the body, circling around with it for three days, instructing it about the creatures of the world. Then, they lead it to the Amente before Ariel, where it is punished for three months, eight days, and two hours. After that, they bring it into chaos before Yaldabaoth and his forty-nine demons, where each demon punishes it for another three months, eight days, and two hours.After that, they take it to the middle path, and each of the rulers of the middle path punishes it with dark smoke and wicked fire for another three months, eight days, and two hours. Then, they bring it to the Virgin of Light, who judges both the righteous and the sinners. She judges it, and when the sphere turns, she hands it over to her receivers to cast it into the aeons of the sphere. They then lead it to a water below the sphere, where it becomes a seething fire that burns it until it is completely purified.

Next, Yaluham, the receiver of Sabaoth, Adamas, brings the cup of forgetfulness and gives it to the soul, which drinks and forgets everything and all the regions it had visited. They then cast it into a body that is lame, halt, and blind. This is the punishment for the thief.

Andrew asked, "What happens to an arrogant, overconfident man when he leaves his body?" Jesus answered, "When his time is completed in the sphere, the receivers of Ariel come for him, take his soul out of the body, and spend three days traveling around the world with it, showing it the creatures of the world. Then they take it down to Amente before Ariel, who punishes it for twenty months. After that, they bring it to chaos before Yaldabaoth and his forty-nine demons, who each take turns punishing it for another twenty months. Then, they bring it to the middle path, and each of the rulers there punishes it for another twenty months. Finally, they bring it to the Virgin of Light for judgment. When the sphere turns, she hands it over to her receivers to cast it into the aeons of the sphere.And the servants of the sphere lead it into water below the sphere; it turns into a boiling fire and purifies it. Then Yaluham, the receiver of Sabaoth, Adamas, comes and brings the cup with the water of forgetfulness, giving it to the soul. The soul drinks and forgets all things and all the places it has been. They then place the soul into a lame and deformed body, so that it is persistently despised. This is the punishment for the arrogant and overly proud man.

Thomas asked, "What is the punishment for a persistent blasphemer?"

Jesus replied, "When the time for such a person is completed through the sphere, the receivers of Yaldabaoth come and bind him by his tongue to a great demon with a horse's face. They travel around the world with him for three days, taking vengeance on him. After that, they lead him to the region of cold and snow and punish him for eleven years. Then they take him down into chaos before Yaldabaoth and his forty-nine demons, and each demon takes vengeance on him for another eleven years. After that, they lead him into the outer darkness until the day when the great ruler with the dragon's face, who encircles the darkness, is judged. The soul becomes frozen, destroyed, and dissolved. This is the judgment of the blasphemer."

Bartholomew asked, "What is the punishment for a man who has intercourse with another male?"

Jesus said, "The punishment for a man who has intercourse with males and the man with whom he lies is the same as that of the blasphemer. When their time is completed through the sphere, the receivers of Yaldabaoth come for their soul, and Yaldabaoth with his forty-nine demons takes vengeance on it for eleven years."They are then taken to rivers of fire and boiling seas of pitch, filled with demons that have pigs' faces. These demons torment them in the fire-rivers for another eleven years. After that, they are taken into outer darkness until Judgment Day, when the great darkness will be judged, and they will be destroyed.

Thomas asked, "We’ve heard of people on earth who mix male seed and female menstrual blood into a lentil porridge and eat it, saying they believe in Esau and Jacob. Is this appropriate?"

Jesus was angry and replied to Thomas, "Truly, I say, this sin is worse than all other sins and wickedness. Such people will immediately be cast into the outer darkness and will not return to the sphere; they will be destroyed in a place where there is no mercy or light, only wailing and gnashing of teeth. All souls sent to the outer darkness will not return but will be destroyed."

John asked, "What happens to a person who has committed no sin and has consistently done good but has not learned the mysteries needed to pass through the rulers when they die?"

Jesus answered, "If their time in the sphere is complete, the receivers of Bainchoooch, one of the triple-powered gods, will come for their soul. They will lead the soul with joy and happiness, spending three days showing it the creations of the world. After that, they will take it to the Amente and show it the instruments of punishment there. However, they will not be punished; they will only be shown these things, and the smoke from the flames will touch them only slightly."Afterward, they take it up to the middle path and explain the punishments of the middle ways, with the smoke from the flame slightly touching it. Then, they bring it to the Virgin of Light, who judges it and places it with the lesser Sabaoth, the Good, of the Middle, until the sphere turns, and Zeus and Aphrodite face the Virgin of Light, while Kronos and Ares are behind her. At that moment, she takes the righteous soul and gives it to her receivers, who cast it into the sphere's regions. The sphere's servants then lead it into water below the sphere; a boiling fire rises and consumes it until it is completely purified.

After that, Yaluham, the receiver of Sabaoth, the Adamas, gives the cup of forgetfulness to the soul, and it drinks, forgetting all things and regions it has been to. Then, another receiver from the lesser Sabaoth, the Good, of the Middle, brings a cup filled with thoughts and wisdom, containing sobriety, and gives it to the soul. They then place it into a body that cannot sleep or forget because of the cup of sobriety it received. It will continuously question the mysteries of the Light until it finds them, as decided by the Virgin of Light, and inherits the Light forever.

CHAPTER 148

Mary asked: "If a man has committed all sins and iniquities and has not found the mysteries of the Light, will he receive punishment for them all at once?" Jesus answered: "Yes, he will receive it; if he has committed three sins, he will be punished for three."John asked, "If a man has committed every sin but eventually discovers the mysteries of the Light, can he still be saved?" Jesus replied, "A man who commits all sins but later finds the mysteries of the Light, practices them, and stops sinning will inherit the Treasury of the Light."

Jesus then told his disciples, "When the sphere turns, and Kronos and Ares are behind the Virgin of Light, while Zeus and Aphrodite are in front of her, the veils of the Virgin will part, and she will be joyful upon seeing these two light-stars. All the souls she sends into the world at that time will be righteous and good, and they will find the mysteries of the Light. She sends them anew so they may discover these mysteries.

"On the other hand, if Ares and Kronos are in front of the Virgin and Zeus and Aphrodite are behind her, so she cannot see them, then all the souls she sends at that time will be wicked and angry, and they will not find the mysteries of the Light."

When Jesus said this to his disciples in the Amente, they cried and said, "Woe to the sinners who suffer from the neglect and forgetfulness of the rulers until they leave their bodies and face these punishments! Have mercy on us, Son of the Holy One, and save us from these punishments and judgments prepared for sinners, for we too have sinned, our Lord and our Light."

Pistis Sophia, by G.R.S. Mead, [1921], at sacred-texts.comThey went out in groups of three to the four corners of the world, spreading the message of the kingdom's goodness. Christ worked through them, confirming their words with signs and wonders. This made the kingdom of God known across the earth and throughout Israel, serving as a witness to all nations from sunrise to sunset. [TWO LINES ERASED.] THE END.

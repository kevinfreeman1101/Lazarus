# Operation Lazarus

Operation Lazarus is a digital library of modernized, summarized, and expanded versions of antiquated and ancient texts. As the work moves forward, our catalog will include the full range of freely available written work from historians, philosophers, religious leaders, and scientists spanning all of human history.

In accordance with the open source philosophy, all modernized base texts will be made available to the public for free. Additional file formats and expanded texts with added graphics, historical context, commentary, and analysis - along with audiobooks, merch, and additional benefits - will also be available to Patreon sponsors.

Development is proceeding rapidly. The first batch of publications will be made available on or before August 1, 2024
